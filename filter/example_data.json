    "After Moderna published primary efficacy results of Phase 3 studies in late November, the FDA announced emergency use author - ization shortly thereafter.11,29 Mechanism of action The Pfizer and Moderna vaccine both use mRNA technology and are considered to have similar mechanisms of action.30 This mechanism is discussed on page 5. Efficacy The Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine is 94.1% effective at pro- tecting against symptomatic COVID-19 after administration of the second dose. The vaccine’s efficacy in the age cohort of >65 appears to be slightly lower, at 86.4%. There were no significant differences in efficacy across ethnic and racial groups.",
    "So far, both COVID-19 vaccines have their own pros and cons and appear to be effective. The incidence of adverse effects is reported to be lower with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine than with the Moderna vaccine; however, the Moderna vaccine compared to the Pfizer vaccine is easier to transport and store because it is less temperature sensitive. With fur - ther research, the science community will hope - fully bring forth new radical measures to fight this disease and finally bring an end to this pandemic. Study Strengths and Limitations This is the first study in the literature, to our knowledge, to highlight a comparison between the biology, pharmacology, indications, contra - indications and adverse effects of the Pfizer/Bi - oNTech and Moderna vaccines for a better under - standing of these two vaccines.",
    "The Pfizer vaccine is giv - en in two slightly smaller dosages of 30 μg14,15, whereas the Moderna vaccine is given in two 50 μg dosages16,17. The Pfizer vaccine is approved for ages 16 years up, whereas the Moderna vaccine is approved for ages 18 years and up. The efficacy reported for the Pfizer vaccine, at 95%14 is very slightly more than that reported for the Moderna vaccine at 94.5%16. However, differences between the two arise when their factors of cost, storage requirements, and beneficial or adverse effects are considered. The Pfizer vaccine is significantly less costly than the Moderna vaccine, and their costs are $19.50 USD and $32-37 USD, respectively18.",
    "Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines recorded a percentage efficacy of 95% and 94.1%. On the other hand, AstraZeneca and Sinovac vaccine recorded a percentage efficacy of 70.4% and 78 %, respectively. Although the COVID -19 vaccine is deployed based on immunogenicity data and safety measures, vaccine development aims to obtain evidence on vaccine efficacy in protecting individual s against SARS -CoV-2 infection [23]. Assessment for vaccine efficacy for COVID -19 is complex where a fundamental understanding o f pathogen evolving is crucial [23] .",
    "Most importantly the Moderna, AstraZeneca/Oxford, and Pfizer/BioNtech vaccines seem effective and nearly equivalent in preventing serious disease due to COVID -19. Evidence, for the ability of the Sputnik V vaccine to prevent serious disease has yet to be published though it is effective in preventing infection . All four vaccines seem relatively safe with the greatest risk being anaphylaxis, though rare can be life threatening. Though these vaccines will more and likely be approved following the completion of their phase III cli nical trials one should consider a benefit cost analysis. Those at high risk such as those over the age of 60 or with moderate to severe chronic health problems should be the first to receive these vaccines.",

    "Thus, we conducted a rigorous analysis using the RCT CASP tools for the two RCTs, P ﬁzer (Polack et al., 2020 ) and Moderna ( Baden et al., 2021 ), and the reporting of these RCTs using the Consolidated Standardsof Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist.

Findings of this paper show that other vaccines are awaiting clinical roll out for trials. Even thou gh these efficacies imply that the vaccines offer significant protection against the infection, further research and evaluation should go on to achieve higher efficacies while addressing any safety concerns that may go beyond local and systemic reactions t hat occur on patients after vaccination. This study concludes that even with the protection of the present vaccines, individuals must continue wearing personal protective equipment (PPEs) such as masks .",

Centrally for this project, for ages 60+, two- dose Pfizer vaccinees are substantially healthier (they have lower Non- Covid- NMR) than two -dose Moderna vaccinees, and three- dose Pfizer vaccinees are substantially healthier than three- dose Moderna vaccinees.

    "Conclusions The FDA has authorized, on an emergency ba - sis, the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. These two vaccines can provide protection from SARS-COV- 2 infection by formation of antibod - ies, to provide immunity against a SARS-COV-2 infection, with humoral as well as possibly cel - lular immunity, which has led to great hope for ending the COVID-19 pandemic. The available evidence supports the conclusion that both vac - cines are beneficial, but may cause some adverse effects including pain, redness or swelling at the site of vaccine shot, nausea, vomiting, fever, fa - tigue, headache, muscle pain, itching, chills, and joint pain, as well as in rare cases they may cause an anaphylactic reaction. The occurrence of these adverse effects is reported to be lower with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine than with the Moderna vaccine.

    "While certain developed nations are vaccinating their citizens free of charge, others are charging the public and must consider whether the vaccine is affordable by all the citizens, because the health and lives of all individuals of a society are equally important and universal vaccination is an excel - lent way to reach herd immunity. Special consid - eration must be taken by low-income countries where the average person can simply afford the vaccine or not, and if so, then cost would be a consideration. However, despite its lower cost, the Pfizer vaccine’s major issue lies with its storage temperature between -80ºC and -60ºC (-112ºF to -76ºF)19, whereas the Moderna vaccine is stored at a relatively much higher temperature between -25º and -15ºC20 that is easier to maintain. This temperature requirement can pose a challenge to low-income countries, many of which also face an energy crisis, as to how they will manage such low storage temperature conditions to ensure the promising results of both the vaccines, especial - ly the Pfizer vaccine, with although cheaper, re - quires much lower and more difficult to maintain storage temperatures. Published data has shown that both vaccines elicit a similar humoral re - sponse, and the published literature reports no difference in cellular immunity.",

    "Notwithstanding sharp differences in proposed approaches to guar- antee access to high-quality care at an affordable price, an emerging consensus among researchers, policy makers, and the public reflects the urgency of im- proving health care quality and value. Last year AHRQ's annual report to the Congress on quality, the National Healthcare Quality Report, found that while quality had improved overall in all settings and population groups, the rate of that improvement has diminished.",
    "Moreover, the overall rate of improvement stands in sharp contrast to the annual increase in health spending for the same year. For example, in 2006 the increase in improvement was 2.3 percent in contrast to a 6.7 percent increase in annual spending (Brady, Ho, and Clancy 2008).",
    "While the overall costs of health care have received continued scrutiny, the question of what are we getting for our substantial investment has only recently emerged as a primary focus for reform efforts. The larger context for these discussions is shaped by a global economic decline, which magnifies the burden on U.S. employers who provide insur- ance to their workers. While domestic spending freezes may be on the near horizon, celebration of and continued support for the leadership role of the United States in basic science and clinical discovery represents an area of bipartisan consensus.",
    "Far less attention has been focused on the delay in applying the products of biomedical science to the benefit of patient care. An example of success in 2007 was removal of the quality measure that assesses the delivery of beta blockers to individuals who have had a heart attack to reduce subsequent mortality from the list of measures used to score health plan performance, because performance has become routinely excel- lent.",
    "Any sense of elation, however, is tempered by the slow speed of im- provement, that is, the landmark clinical trial results from which this measure derives were published 25 years ago (Brady, Ho, and Clancy 2008). This is but one example of many illustrating that we face a longstanding challenge assuring rapid uptake of scientific advances.",
    "HSR: Health Services Research 44:1 (February 2009) Health services researchers have made enduring contributions to the development and use of measures to assess health care quality.",
    "From McGlynn's seminal study in 2003 (McGlynn et al. 2003) to increasingly sophisticated cross-national comparisons (Schoen et al. 2007), the products of research are now familiar to millions of Americans. Whether examining peer- reviewed publications or quality report cards, these assessments consistently reflect a substantial and persistent gap between high-quality, evidence-based care and that which is routinely delivered.",
    "Public reporting has been associated with improvements in performance, but the effect has been less than dramatic (Hibbard, Stockard, and Tusler 2003, 2005a, b). Recent endeavors of the research community have begun to focus on the following important questions for policy and for our populations' health: why has this gap remained resistant to growing interest in improving quality; how can we achieve reliability in health care; which policy levers have the greatest impact; and what resources are required to do so? Two articles published in this issue of the journal focus on important aspects of what has been referred to as the science of improvement.",
    "Titler et al. (2009) report on the outcome of a multifaceted intervention to improve pain management for elderly patients with hip fractures. In this instance, what to do----the evidence base----is clear, and the number of patients and impact on early ambulation and fewer adverse outcomes is significant, yet the opportunity gap remains.",
    "Using Rogers' diffusion of innovation model, the researchers designed a randomized experiment in 12 hospitals. In addition to an evidence-based guideline on pain management re- ceived by all participants, experimental hospitals received an intervention that addressed characteristics of the innovation (evidence-based acute pain man- agement for adults), the users (physicians, nurses, and others), the social sys- tem or context, and the communication strategies. The results demonstrated a statistically significant effect on decreased pain intensity and a positive effect on clinicians' practice behaviors and barriers to use of evidence-based acute pain management practices.",
    "While the design, randomization at the hospital level, was strong, it did not permit assessment of which components of the intervention were most effective. Liu et al. (2009) focused on the organizational costs of a depression care quality improvement program, based on the best possible evidence, within the Veterans Health Administration system (VA). In this study, the research team focused not on the patient care costs, but on the organizational resources required for the initial phases of an evidence-based program implementation.",
    "All activities, from time spent reading e-mail and holding conference calls Building the Path to High-Quality Care to honoraria for participants to time required by members of the technical support team, were carefully accounted for with intriguing results. Estimated total costs for program implementation were $100,000 per region for each of three regions.",
    "Integration of the program into the VA's electronic health re- cord system accounted for one-third of requisite resources, and incorporation of the new model into standard policies and culture was also costly. Impor- tantly, the authors raise the question of whether the costs of sequential spread will decrease over time.",
    "These studies stand in sharp contrast to policy and market expectations of efforts to improve quality and value. Today there are numerous websites and other sources for publicly reported information on quality of hospitals---- including patient experience, nursing homes, home health agencies and health plans, and the demands for this information are strong and growing. How transparent information filters to those at the front lines of care has received far less attention (Ginsburg 2003).",
    "Instead, belief in the existence of ''transformative'' interventions----from health information technology (IT) to disease management to many others----which will effect dramatic improve- ments, feeds the illusion that clarifying the targets of opportunity is equivalent to addressing them. Moreover, the urgent need to build the science has not yet been clearly articulated in a persuasive way to encourage much-needed investments in improvement methods, training, and demonstrations.",
    "The implications of this challenge for the research community are sub- stantial. As described in both studies by Titler, Liu and colleagues in this issue, this work is far more challenging than some traditional research areas, such as descriptive analyses of large databases, because it requires effective engage- ment with policy makers, clinicians, health care leaders and patients.",
    "Insti- tutional Review Board approval, methods development, and new models for training future researchers are just a few of the areas that require thoughtful examination and change. In addition, effective transition from a health care environment that is now highly fragmented and too often chaotic to one that is information-rich and patient-focused will require new approaches to training clinicians and health care leaders to become informed consumers of the products of improvement science.",
    "Promotion and tenure requirements that implicitly or explicitly celebrate discoveries and presume that their application is a lesser contribution also create a barrier to aligning inquiry and evaluation with improved health and health care. Despite these challenges, the potential return on investing in improve- ment science is too important to ignore.",
    "Health care organizations, clinicians HSR: Health Services Research 44:1 (February 2009) and patients desperately need to know when their well-intended efforts are likely to fail and how to spread isolated successes broadly. Researchers attempting to address the question ''Why aren't we doing better?''",
    "will dis- cover that classic hypothesis testing may not be a good fit, and they will also need to develop skills in collaboration with those delivering care, new meth- ods, and a clear sense of a viable career path. Indeed, current and future researchers may find a more logical focus for their work in research entities tightly linked with health care organizations.",

Great Republic Insurance Company had been using a supplemental ques- tionnaire to screen out \"occupations that do not require physical exertion ... such as florists, interior decorators, and fashion designers,\" as well as to use applicants' marital status, \"living arrangements,\" and medical history to assess the likely risk of their exposure to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) when denying health care coverage.1 That same year, Moblization for Youth (MFY) Legal Services in New York filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of women living with HIV who had been denied access to Social Security benefits because the government did not recognize their HIV-related conditions as qualifying for state health care coverage under the Medicaid program.2",
    "In one sense, the cases were starkly different: one sought to protect the privately insured from discriminatory scrutiny on the basis of their sex- uality while the other attempted to bring a protected class of people into public view to make a claim to health care. Yet both reveal an important truth about the concept of rights in an American context.",
    "The structure of the U.S. health care system, one based on private insurance for most and a threadbare, convoluted system of categorical assistance and public insurance for children, the disabled, and the elderly, has shaped Americans' experience of their own sexuality and bodily autonomy in ways arguably unique to the United States. The public/private hybrid in health care has dramatically curtailed the capacity of those outside the heteronormative fam- ily structure to realize their demands for full equality in the wake of the rights revolutions.",
    "Efforts to secure a right to sexual or gender identity have foundered on the rocks of the health care system when faced, for example, with a public health crisis like HIV or a lack of health insurance plans willing to fund gender-affirming health care. To demonstrate the complex relationship between sex-based rights and the politics of dis- tribution of health care services, I chart three dimensions to sexual health in the United States since the 1970s.",
    "The first concerns the economic imperative at the heart of the self-help health movements, as activists strove to provide affordable, accessible care for women and les- bian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people often at the margins of the main- stream health care system. The second shows how the risk calculus of the private health insurance marketplace reinforced and recalibrated the marginalization of sexual minorities of 1NGRA press release, May 3, 1990, unnamed folder, box 1, National Gay Rights Advocates Papers, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender Historical Society, San Francisco, CA. 2\"Women with AIDS Demand Rights,\" Workers World, Apr. 9, 1992; and Terry McGovern Interview 076, ACT UP",

Finally, I explore how the U.S. welfare system was structured to limit its reach to as few people as possible in ways that disproportionately impacted women living with HIV during the 1980s and early 1990s. These stories highlight the fragility of an individual's right to sexual freedom without a health system predicated upon universal access.",
    "The idea that gendered health care needed to be available to all regardless of socio-economic status demonstrated the close relationship between a politics of individual rights and of distri- bution of resources. The self-help health movement of the 1970s that sprang out of second- wave feminism and gay liberation aimed to empower people to understand their bodies and provide health care services tailored to their needs.",
    "The proliferation of clinics, volunteer groups, and grassroots political organizations devoted to the health and wellbeing of women and sexual minorities combined the promotion of education and empowerment with efforts to ensure access to all who needed services.3 Women's and LGBTQ clinics advertised free or subsidized care, based on ability to pay, and many accepted Medicaid as well as private insur- ance. For some, particularly those focused on women's health needs, self-empowerment and access to care were inextricably linked. \"Two societal conditions are largely responsible for the fact that women in general are not well served by our health care system,\" wrote a founding member of a San Francisco women's clinic in the late 1970s: \"the sexism of many physicians\" and diminished access arising from \"women's general lower economic status--we earn 58.5 cents to every dollar earned by men.",
    "\"4 Women exploring their own bodies in the 1970s, \"work- ing to learn about health care in an attempt ... to take care of ourselves and our own people,\" constantly referenced the economic dimension of their activism. Early member of the Los Angeles Feminist Women's Clinic Frances Hornstein recalled self-help activists visiting and distributing flyers asking for a five-dollar donation: \"That was too much money, I thought in my 'health care should be free' thinking.",
    "I didn't relate that $5.00 to the $25.00 I had paid the previous year for a Pap Smear, a painful pelvic examination and some suppositories for an infection. \"5",
    "A lesbian clinic at San Francisco General Hospital in the late 1970s was dependent on volunteer health workers and a $10 donation from patients, with a sliding scale for those unable to afford that amount.6 At the same time, the fact that health care was a commodity in the United States gave sexual health and identity an economic value that impacted the cultural politics of sexual liberation. Collecting fees from patients in nonprofit clinics was vital to the financial sustainability of many, but exchanging health services for money also formed part of a process of legitimation for those coming to terms with their sexuality.",
    "When informing staff of an effort to tighten up processes for collecting payments from those seeking mental health treatment atthe Homophile Community Health Service in Boston in 1977, the director noted that money \"will certainly continue to be an important issue for clients in therapy. We will inform thera- pists when clients seem to be having trouble around paying.... Certainly, many clients act out around money and these are clinical, as well as administrative, concerns.",

    "The financial aspect of legit- imation and recognition extended to health care professionals as well as patients: a 1982 survey by the National Lesbian and Gay Health Foundation of seventy-two \"lesbian and gay counsel- ling centers\" across the United States noted that only four centers had all paid staff, and that a \"vast number of lesbians and gay males give untold hours to help their fellows.... While the altruism is more than praiseworthy, it does contrast with the non-gay/lesbian world where free counselling is available only through government sponsorship (so that all therapists are paid). Perhaps some day all of the counsellors ... can get just payment for their Herculean efforts.",
    "\"8 Defining the undeniably second-class status of non-heteronormative health care in these terms further demonstrates the interrelationship of \"recognition\" and \"distribution\" in the politics of sex/gender in the specific context of the U.S. health care market.9 The heavy reliance of most Americans on private insurance to fund their health care needs has also shaped the politics of bodily autonomy. The management of actuarial risk has consis- tently required people to reveal their bodies to public scrutiny and to provide or deny treatment and rights dependent on risk-based factors.10 The HIV-AIDS crisis provides the starkest exam- ple, as insurance companies routinely used HIV testing to deny access to funded care or even attempted to screen out claims based on professions or cohabiting status that might indicate an assumed sexual identity and thus risk of HIV.11 Yet what we might call the insurance closet concerned more than the association of sexuality with risk. Even when able to access private health insurance, claimants worried about becoming visible to employers or co-workers. The Director of the Boston mental health clinic discussed earlier wrote in November 1979 that \"despite the advantages of using insurance to pay for therapy,\" many clients were reluctant to claim, fearing \"that their employers will find out they are in therapy, or that they are being seen by a therapist at a gay clinic, or they are being treated for homosexuality.\"12",
    "More than a decade later, AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) Boston's insurance sub- committee, whose members informally referred to themselves as \"the uninsurables,\" wondered how to \"help prevent people from choosing not to use their insurance services; we don't want to scare people away from using the insurance they do have,\" due to worries about their HIV sta- tus being used as a way to cancel their coverage if they dared to make a claim. \"Paying cash,\" they reflected, \"is a kind of fear and denial. \"13",
    "Paying cash could also be the only way of claiming genuine rights to \"a body of one's own,\" as much private insurance has continued to refuse to pay for health care for transgender Americans on the spurious grounds that gender-affirming treatment was not \"medically necessary. \"14",

    "While the women's and gender- self-affirming self-help care remains as important a part of nonconforming rights movements as it was in the early days of the sexual liberation era, the privatized model of institutional health care heightens the urgency of efforts to fight for bodily autonomy outside the confines of that system. Yet the public social safety net has also been constructed to exclude a right to sexual free- doms and equality from its regulatory embrace. From its origins in the veterans' pensions of the post-Civil War era and the Social Security Act of the 1930s, the welfare system has privileged the heteronormative family unit and the elderly at the expense of single people, those without children, and LGBTQ+ people.16 Centered on the need to protect children, the severely dis- abled, and the aged, the system was particularly ill-suited to the needs of women and sexual minorities in the wake of the rights revolutions. State authorities consistently linked the ration- ing of public resources to the disciplining of people's bodies. In 1977, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) essentially banned women \"of child-bearing potential\" from participat- ing as subjects in early phase clinical research or drug trials.17 This had the effect of erasing women from much state policy, especially concerning their access to welfare, while reinforcing the notion that women were procreators first and autonomous beings last.",
    "As the federal med- ical establishment (the FDA, Centers for Disease Control [CDC], National Institutes for Health) determined the criteria for defining eligibility for Social Security programs for those classed disabled--the only route to Medicare/Medicaid coverage for people without children or under the age of sixty-five--the lack of understanding of disease progression or drug efficacy in women during the 1980s had a devastating impact on their experience of the HIV-AIDS cri- sis. Many disease manifestations of HIV in women were not recognized by medical and Social Security bureaucrats as being related, and indeed the CDC stressed how conditions such as vag- inal thrush were common and therefore not appropriate for an epidemiological benchmark for HIV surveillance (this rationale also explained the exclusion of tuberculosis--the most com- mon disease manifestation of HIV worldwide--from the CDC definition, despite it affecting huge numbers of people living with the HIV virus, especially the impoverished in communities of color).18 HIV-AIDS rapidly became an intersectional crisis of gender, race, and class due to the explicit link between scarcity or rationing of social welfare and state surveillance of the gen- dered body.",
    "While some gay men became visible to the state through their early association with diseases that came to define HIV, many others remained invisible until a concerted mul- tiyear campaign was launched to widen the state's definition of HIV and AIDS in the 1990s.

Thinking about sex and gender-based rights through the lens of health care discloses the connections and affective synergies between different rights movements (cisgender women or trans people, or the various categories contained under the LGBTQ+ umbrella) due to the discriminatory and exclusionary workings of the U.S. health care system. It also suggests that homophobic, misogynistic, or transphobic legal or cultural discrimination based on mis- recognition and innate prejudice has been in constant negotiation with the way social goods related to bodily autonomy have been (mal)distributed.",
    "While other health systems have also discriminated when assigning priorities for services outside the parameters of the heteronorma- tive nuclear family, the burden imposed by the U.S. public/private hybrid has had a particularly heavy impact on women and LGBTQ+ people. Even before the rollback of gender rights sig- nalled in the recent Dobbs Supreme Court decision, it was clear, as Mary Ziegler shows in her contribution to this forum, that the existence of a legal right did not always translate into an ability to access gender-based health care. The absence of a universal right to health underscores the ever-present fragility of the broader range of privacy-based rights ostensibly advanced after the seemingly landmark decision in Roe v Wade. https://doi.org/10.1017/mah.2023.7",

BioWatch information enables federal, state, and local officials to more quickly determine appropriate emergency response, medical care and consequence management. In the current BioWatch system, air is sampled by a network of distributed aerosol collectors, and the resulting filter samples are taken to a central analytical laboratory for processing.",
    "Samples are processed using several individual TaqMan(tm)-based PCR assays designed to test the sample for different biological agents. The established protocol requires that any individual presumptive screen reactive test be re-analyzed using a much more extensive panel of assays. Even though this kind of testing is time-consuming and labor intensive, BioWatch has analyzed well over two million samples with zero false positives to date. Although the current system has exhibited unparalleled performance, the time between aerosol collection and analytical results may be long (averaging 24 hours), depending upon collector and lab locations), and because the system is very labor intensive, it is very expensive to operate.",

    "This panel of assays is under final evaluation by the CDC and will be considered a validated panel in the coming months following a multicenter performance study. After validation, the assays will be commercially produced and be available for purchase by all members of the LRN. Because the multiplexed assays are contained within a single tube and are performed simultaneously, the multiplexed panel offers significantly enhanced detection capabilities with a 60% reduction in costs and significant savings in labor relative to the costs and time required to run each individual assay. The multiplexed assays represent the next-generation of BioWatch assays and will compliment the existing singleplex TaqMan(tm)-based detection assays currently in use within the BioWatch laboratory network. Additionally, these assays are compatible with high-throughput sample \"surge\" processing and analysis capacity robotics: sample processing capacity currently stands at about 4,000 samples per 10 hour shift, using a single line of equipment and a staff of two. Over the coming months, these assays will be transitioned to the APDS.",
    "The APDS is a stand-alone instrument capable of continuous, fully autonomous monitoring for multiple airborne biological threat agents.1,2 The system was developed to protect people in critical or high-traffic facilities (such as airports, subways, government and commerce centers) and at special events (such as conventions and sporting events). The current version of the APDS continuously collects samples from the air into water, performs multiplexed immunoassays, 3 analyzes the results, sends silent notification to monitoring authorities, and performs confirmatory TaqMan(tm) PCR4 in response to an immunoassay presumptive screen reactive result, all in continuous unattended operation that has been benchmarked at 7 days.",
    "APDS is in operational test and evaluation in New York City. The total number of samples APDS has analyzed in the field stands at 12,816 samples, which is equivalent to a total of 77,788 immunoassays and 834 PCR assays.",
    "Although the current APDS does not conduct multiplexed nucleic acid assays, the system contains all of the functions (aerosol collection, PCR, reagent manipulation, flow- cytometry) required to execute the multiplexed PCR assays. Enabling the units to run the full multiplexed LRN PCR panel in the field is clearly feasible without extensive hardware or software development. With support from SED, LLNL will perform proof- of-concept experiments that demonstrate APDS could automate the multiplexed nucleic acid assay process and will then fully automate and test the process on the bench and in an APDS in the laboratory. Concurrently, the CDC will operate a Multiplex PCR APDS platform to verify the performance of the automated fluidics system compared to the high-throughput laboratory process.",
    "The performance of six APDS instruments in the field in NYC will be evaluated in the phase of operational test and evaluation. Upon completion of this work, the APDS systems will then be capable of running the full LRN panel for long periods of time in a fully automated mode, where air is continuously sampled and tested using a full panel of screening and confirmatory assays in a single test.",

    "[1-4]. With current regimens, sterilization of drug-susceptible organisms requires at least six months of treatment to prevent disease relapse.",
    "Unfortunately, pill burden, drug toxicity, stigma, and poor provider practice often complicate these prolonged treatment courses, and nonadherence is widely blamed for the global epidemic of drug-resistant TB. Directly observed therapy (DOT) has for decades been considered crucial to ensuring anti-TB medication adherence worldwide, but carries important individual and health policy concerns.",
    "This week in PLOS Medicine, Fielding and colleagues present a cluster randomized trial of an alternative strategy--managing adherence with reminders delivered by an electronic pillbox or text messaging. DOT is variously defined as 5-7 daily doses per week observed by facility-, workplace-, or community-based healthcare workers or confidants. Although DOT is employed selectively for other communicable and noncommunicable diseases for which incomplete adherence threat- ens treatment success, DOT in TB treatment has become enshrined as \"canon in a field long characterized by fervor in principle and practice\" as in no other disease [5].",
    "First implemented in Madras and Hong Kong in the 1950s [6], DOT became globally endorsed (as one of five key components of the World Health Organization directly observed therapy short-course [DOTS] strategy)",
    "[7] in 1994 in the aftermath of public health alarm created by an outbreak of multi- drug-resistant (MDR)-TB in New York City [8]. Operationalization of DOT varies according to resource availability, cultural factors, and individual provider perception, and is often incomplete, even among populations for which strict adherence is considered essential [9].",
    "Although in its best form DOT can be a platform for patient social support and guidance, it has long been debated whether the requirement for witnessed dosing represents the least restrictive alternative in pursuit of public health goals [10]. Conceived of as a principal standard of care to protect individuals from drug resistance amplification and communities from a potentially devastating airborne disease, DOT in some cases adversely impacts the dignity, autonomy, and livelihoods of patients who are often already poor and disenfranchised [11]. For example, among patients receiving treatment for both HIV and drug-resistant TB, loss of a sense of agency due to provider supervision of TB treatment contributes to preferential adherence to antiretrovirals over drug-resistant TB therapy, complicating combined treatment regimens a11111 OPEN ACCESS Citation: Metcalfe JZ, O'Donnell MR, Bangsberg DR (2015) Moving Beyond Directly Observed Therapy for Tuberculosis.

    "To what degree does nonadherence lead to treatment failure or acquisition of drug resis- tance? In contrast to HIV, for which the complex relationship between adherence, pharmacoki- netics, and resistance for each antiretroviral class is defined [13], the levels and patterns of adherence that lead to TB treatment failure and drug resistance remain largely unknown",
    "[14]. Observational studies from the United States [15] and Botswana",
    "[16] in the 1990s documented associations between DOT-supported adherence and prevention of drug resistance. However, a meta-analysis of randomized trials [17] comparing DOT to self-administration of TB treat- ment failed to demonstrate improved treatment outcome (though the component trials were heterogeneous [18] and were not powered to examine drug resistance amplification).",
    "In addi- tion, preclinical studies suggest that TB treatment is robust to relatively high levels of nonad- herence [19], and certain drugs and drug combinations are more or less forgiving than others [4,20]. Nevertheless, adherence challenges with prior TB treatment are a common refrain among people living with MDR-TB [21].",
    "The study by Fielding and colleagues was a four-arm cluster randomized trial, involving 4,173 patients in 36 health centers across China, designed to assess the effect of dosing and refill reminders delivered by cell phone text message, electronic pillbox, or both, on patient adher- ence to six months of intermittent (every other day) TB treatment. The primary outcome was the proportion of patient-months in which (cid:1)20% of doses were missed (\"nonadherent months\"), measured by either monthly pill counts or electronic pillbox openings (which did not produce audible reminders in the control arm of the study). Despite use of medication pill- boxes, various forms of DOT, and data-informed (pill counts) counseling in the control arm, substantial nonadherence was observed (30% nonadherent months).",
    "Electronic pillbox reminders, but not text messages alone, significantly decreased the primary outcome (17% nonadherent months). This effect was stronger when text message reminders were added to pillbox reminders (14% nonadherent months). Approximately one-tenth of patients were excluded because of inability to use mobile phones after training, and nearly one-third of ran- domized patients (and one-half of those in the combined text messaging and electronic pill box arm) experienced technical problems with their device (S5 Table in the supplementary material of the paper by Fielding and colleagues).",
    "Despite substantial nonadherence to an inter- mittent regimen, adverse end-of-treatment outcomes, other than loss to follow up, were rare in this low HIV burden setting. Significant technical complications in the trial related to battery connectivity suggest that additional work is needed to both confirm benefit and facilitate scale-up, and the data provide little indication of whether durable effects on treatment outcomes (beyond loss to follow-up) should be anticipated.",
    "Yet, the study by Fielding and colleagues is unusual in providing objec- tive TB treatment adherence data combined with a scalable intervention strategy to improve adherence. If replicated, it will have important implications for global TB treatment in moving away from witnessed dosing, which is not universally feasible, towards a more personalized adherence model of patient-provider communication in which intervention is delivered where, when, and in whom it is needed to efficiently prevent adverse treatment outcome.",
    "Will such technology aid transition to a \"post-DOT\" era in low- as well as high-income set- tings? In the field of HIV, \"just-in-time\" adherence interventions linked in real-time to objec- tively monitored adherence have overcome several limitations in traditional counseling-based interventions [22], which cannot anticipate decline in adherence over time or interruptions in daily adherence routines.",
    "Such approaches can potentially reduce healthcare costs by selectively targeting other medical resources (e.g., laboratory monitoring, provider visits, pharmacokinetic PLOS Medicine | DOI:10.1371/journal.pmed.1001877 September 15, 2015 2 / 4 testing) to patients at greatest risk, while foregoing these for patients with near-perfect adher- ence and negligible risk of disengagement, treatment failure, or drug resistance [23]. In its long history with humanity, tuberculosis has in many ways provided the prototype for chronic disease management.",
    "The cornerstone of successful TB treatment has long been recog- nized to lie within the complex inter-relationship between patients and clinical staff and to hinge strongly on structural facilitators to the treatment experience, along with empathy [24]. Shortened, simplified TB treatment regimens in conjunction with technologies facilitating adherence, such as real-time adherence monitoring and novel drug-delivery systems, could support this foundation to speed TB elimination while delivering truly patient-centered care.",

Goldhaber-Fiebert, PhD Center for Primary Care and Outcomes Research and Center for Health Policy, Stanford University, Stanford, California Imagine a new patient \"Bill\", 62 years of age, comes to your clinic for a visit. You want to deliver guideline-recommended preventive care, and decide to use the U.S Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines. More than 10 separate guidelines are relevant to Bill.",
    "Following the guidelines you screen for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, colon cancer, depression, alcohol misuse, depression, diabetes, HIV, obesity, and tobacco use. You learn that Bill is obese, smokes, has high cholesterol, hypertension and diabetes. Given his risk factors, USPSTF guidelines indicate that Bill would be eligible for aspirin to prevent cardiovascular disease, management of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and possibly counseling to promote a healthy diet and physical activity.",
    "Although the goal is to follow all of the guideline recommendations, it may simply not be possible to do everything. If that's true, which of these guideline-recommended interventions are most important?",
    "Will smoking cessation, treatment of diabetes, or weight loss improve Bill's health the most? How can we know, and what metric should we use to decide which interventions provide the most benefit?",
    "How to prioritize what to do in the limited time of a clinical encounter is a pervasive problem in primary care. This question is the topic of a paper by Taksler and colleagues in this issue of the Annals (1).",
    "They address the question in the context of the benefits that accrue from delivery of preventive services and treatment for conditions identified through those services. The goal of their analysis is to identify, for Bill, and for other patients, which interventions result in the biggest increase in how long they can expect to live. To do this, Taksler and colleagues develop a mathematical model that estimates how different interventions (e.g., treatment of diabetes, weight loss) would change Bill's life expectancy.",
    "Life expectancy is the average time a group of people would live, and it's an important measure of health benefit. Changes in life expectancy of a year or more are enormous, and even changes in life expectancy of a few days to weeks may be sufficient to justify an intervention (2).",
    "For example, biennial screening mammography from age 50 to 69 increases life expectancy by approximately 5 weeks (3).

I-NHPAAuthorManuscriptI-NHPAAuthorManuscriptI-NHPAAuthorManuscript Owens and Goldhaber-Fiebert Page 2 admirable job considering all applicable preventive interventions for which the USPSTF has given an A or B recommendation (meaning they are recommended).",
    "The first finding to note is that rather than a life expectancy of 19.1 years, which is expected for an average 62-year old white man, Bill's life expectancy is only 9.6 years (the life expectancy of an average 77-year-old white man). This dramatically shorter life expectancy drives home the seriousness of Bill's comorbid conditions.",
    "Of all the candidate interventions, the ones with most impact on life expectancy are control of diabetes (1.8 life- years gained), smoking cessation (1.5 life-years gained), and blood pressure control (1.4 life-years gained). Lowering cholesterol, use of daily aspirin, weight loss, and eating a healthier diet also provide substantial gains in life expectancy. Screening for colon cancer, HIV and abdominal aortic aneurysms provide much smaller gains.",
    "The rank order of the most important interventions change based on the comorbid conditions, ethnicity, and gender of the patient. For example, for a woman with Bill's conditions, control of diabetes dropped from the first to the fourth largest impact on life expectancy. The change is because of women's lower risk of coronary heart disease.",
    "The value of the tool Taskler and colleagues developed is that it estimates the changes in health outcomes across many interventions, and thus enables us to understand the relative importance of different interventions for a specific patient. Although guideline development groups, such as the USPSTF, use models to help develop guidelines, by necessity, these models evaluate the effect of one intervention (e.g., mammography) on patients with different characteristics.",
    "These models can be very helpful in exploring how screening intervals and starting and stopping ages affect benefits and harms of an intervention delivered to different patient subpopulations (4). However, they are not intended to model multiple diseases or to directly prioritize across conditions and interventions. Modeling the effect of interventions across many diseases is quite ambitious and requires numerous simplifying assumptions.",
    "As the authors note, their analysis is a proof-of-concept rather than a fully implemented tool, and there are extensions that would be valuable. They measure benefit in terms of life expectancy which only accounts for changes in mortality. Other metrics of impact could include a broader set of outcomes.",
    "Quality-adjusted life expectancy accounts for both mortality and morbidity and thus would have an advantage as a metric (5). If patients or clinicians were interested in high-value health care (6), the analysis could also account for costs, and interventions could be prioritized based on cost effectiveness.",
    "Regardless of the metric used, some interventions with high potential benefit (e.g., changing diet or lifestyle, weight loss) may be harder to realize in practice than others (e.g., blood pressure control), a factor that clinicians will likely consider. Some interventions may have synergies (or diminished benefits) when delivered together, another factor that may affect prioritization. In addition, some preventive interventions, such as screening for HIV, have a public health benefit (reduced transmission and consequent health benefits to individuals other than the patient) that is not captured in the framework.",
    "Finally, an analysis could incorporate detailed patient-specific information and preferences to provide individualized decision support (7). Although there is additional work that can be done, the study provides an important contribution. Ann Intern Med.",

Such programs represent an important objective for food producers, not only for the potential risk to human health, but also for the economic losses to which they can be subjected.",

Keywords: Listeria monocytogenes; nanoparticles safety; assay; pollutants; polyciclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Trichinella; Anisakis; Nowadays, food safety has a critical societal importance for producers, regulatory control bodies and consumers. For this purpose, the food industry requires fast, sensitive, reliable, cost-effective and easy-to-use analytical techniques to assess both the safety and quality of products [1,2].",
    "In the last few years, the traditional culture-based enumeration tests used for the detection of microorganisms have become obsolete for real-time applications, as they are time-consuming and labor-intensive, while immunological assays such as the enzyme immunoassay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, enzyme-linked fluorescent assay, flow injection immunoassay and other serological methods are known for their speed, high-throughput capacity and possibility of precise quantification of the target organism [3]. Even for chemical analysis, the development of quick and easy methods is beginning to be preferred to classical laborious techniques [4]. One of these pre-treatment assays for sample preparation is based on the QuEChERS method, with the advantages summarized in its acronym (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe). The study of Nagyova and Tolgyessy [5] reported the validation of a rapid and non-laborious method for the determination of selected H2SO4 stable halogenated priority pollutants (eight organochlorines and six polybrominated diphenyl ethers) in nine different fish species.",

In particular, the applied method showed some advantages in terms of simplicity, rapidity, high extract clean-up efficiency and good sensitivity. Moreover, the proposed assay can be classified as \"an acceptable green analysis method\" with low consumption of hazardous solvents.",

It was observed that the temperature significantly affected the Aw/MC data, but no universal linear equation for these parameters could be established. In this study, the slope was affected only by the state of the honey (liquid or crystallized), while the other factors, such as type, geographical collection sites and botanical source did not significantly affect the slope, but only the intercept of the Aw equation.

On the other hand, the main difficulties shown by the technician working in the internal laboratory were the structural features required by the accreditation body, i.e., the proficiency testing to be carried out each year and the training courses to be followed in order to maintain the accredited status.",

[10] described a rapid, reliable and easy assay for the detection of Anisakis spp. Such a method based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) was optimized, validated and applied in processed fish samples artificially contaminated with the parasite, giving sensitivity values equal to 100%. Indeed, the specificity test provided no amplification for other similar genera of parasites, i.e., Contracaecum, Pseudoterranova, or Hysterothylacium, as well as for uninfected samples. Moreover, the LAMP assay showed both a lower limit of detection and time of analysis in comparison with the real-time PCR method also used in this study, and its ease of use suggested that it could be a valid alternative for routine examination to help manufacturers in HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point) application in the fishery sector.",
    "Among the key attributes of a microbial detection system, there are sensitivity, i.e., the ability to find the target microorganism at low contamination level, and specificity, which allows the selective detection of the target microorganism without cross-reaction with other species. However, rapidity is also a good feature of an analytical assay to obtain fast and reliable results [11].

In recent decades, novel rapid and non-destructive methods for evaluating food quality attributes have been developed. In particular, new detection assays have been explored such as biosensors and novel nanotechnology-based immunoassay are quickly replacing traditional methods offering some advantages to food business operators.",
    "Unlike conventional methods, these techniques acquire data without contact with samples, and some examples are computer vision, spectral or hyperspectral imaging, ultrasound, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR), Fourier transform near infrared spectroscopy (FT-NIR), and Raman spectroscopy [14]. Basile et al. [15] used a fast, simple and non-destructive technique, namely FT-NIR spectroscopy combined with chemometrics, applied to search for a correlation between the chemical composition in terms of sugar and acidic content and sensory data.",

    "National public reporting and pay for performance (P4P) efforts, such as those implemented by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services (CMS), have contributed to improvements in care for these conditions1. Since those CMS programs were developed, however, the epidemiology of hospital care has changed in the United States.",
    "Improvements in outpatient care have substantially reduced the incidence of hospitalization for the conditions on which CMS currently focuses, specifically AMI, CHF, and pneumonia. Moreover, fewer than 10% of patients with these three conditions now die during their hospital stay.",

In marked contrast to adherence to treatment guidelines for AMI, CHF and pneumonia process measures, published reports routinely cite less than 35% compliance with current best practice for sepsis care5. Some may suggest that the rollout of national accountability measures for sepsis is premature6. These concerns, however, are largely not empirically based.",
    "Some contend that claims-based definitions of sepsis lack adequate validity, but in fact the specificity for the most widely used claims-based definition for severe sepsis is greater than 96% and is comparable to that of other CMS conditions7. There are concerns that the increase in sepsis diagnoses may reflect \"upcoding\" (selection of billing codes intended to increase reimbursement) rather than a true change in incidence; mandates could improve the identification and appropriate care of true sepsis cases, and as an additional effect could allow more accurate epidemiology and policy monitoring.",
    "While there are concerns about whether outcomes for patients with sepsis can be improved, RCTs and observational studies have identified early recognition, timely antibiotic administration, and aggressive fluid resuscitation as effective in reducing sepsis-related mortality8. Moreover, sizeable improvements in mortality in sepsis can be achieved through quality initiatives that integrate these therapies9, in part because too few patients currently receive optimal care.",
    "A next-generation quality improvement target like sepsis will require implementation of next-generation performance measures that build on what has been learned since public reporting and P4P began. Simply mandating reporting of 30-day risk-adjusted mortality, or even CMS' recent decision to require hospitals to report adherence to the NQF's severe sepsis and septic shock management bundle,10 may help, but will not be sufficient.",
    "In this, sepsis is not unique; other patients could benefit from more innovative approaches too. However, for CMS to maximally drive performance improvement, these changes are particularly important for sepsis. First, new mandates to improve sepsis must address the reality that sepsis is frequently under-diagnosed7.",
    "Existing quality metrics for AMI, CHF and pneumonia capitalized on previous decades' work to make accurate recognition of those conditions nearly universal. But quality improvement cannot be limited to only those conditions for which the diagnosis is already accurate.",
    "Quality improvement mandates could improve not only the completeness, but also the precision of sepsis diagnosis. A quality improvement focus on diagnostic accuracy could provide spillover benefits for non-sepsis patients as well. New sepsis mandates have the potential to advance the science and practice of quality improvement to face the common reality of diagnostic ambiguity or inadequacy.",
    "Second, sepsis mandates should focus on catalyzing and aggregating local efforts for quality improvement. Increasing evidence suggests that current public reporting and P4P methods are insufficient tools to fully improve care11. Instead, CMS could scale up collaborative quality improvement using methods that incentivize gains in the culture of care, foster professionalism and sharing of best practices, and improve workflow of care processes--that is, work to target learning rather than only judging11. In doing so, CMS could promote sharing across hospital boundaries of how to better care for patients.",

Such early adopters can include those just beginning quality improvement, as well as longstanding leaders such as Kaiser Permanente and Intermountain Healthcare. Careful assessment of the challenges of implementing policy mandates in these settings brings to light the potential for harms when mandates are widely implemented, but does so in a way that helps develop solutions rather than simply documenting barriers.",
    "Fourth, sepsis mandates must plan to be highly responsive to new evidence. Quality measurement seeks to ensure that every patient receives the currently recognized best possible care; therefore, when best care improves, quality measurement should improve in tandem. One NQF sepsis measure provides an optimistic example of such responsiveness: the ProCESS trial demonstrated that focus on recognition, early antibiotics, and fluid resuscitation may achieve equivalent sepsis outcomes to more complicated protocols that mandate central line placement8.",
    "NQF promptly revised its measure to remove the need for central venous catheterization. A new sepsis mandate must be equally responsive to new, yet-to-be-published evidence. Pragmatically this means planning for regular review of measures, having a system for putting some measures \"on hiatus\" pending a review of new data, and admitting that a single promulgation will not forever capture the state-of-the-art of a dynamic science.",
    "Sepsis is a major public health problem and has become a dominant diagnosis and cause of death in US hospitals. Implementation of national programs that track and mandate improvements in care and outcomes of sepsis could improve the prognosis for patients with sepsis. National programs for sepsis are needed that improve imperfect diagnosis, that focus on learning rather than judging, that use phased implementation, and that have planned growth in response to new scientific evidence rather than static rules. Current practices mean that only one third of patients with sepsis will receive the excellent care. Clinicians--as well as the health care system--can do better if properly led, and now is the time to start to do so.",

    "Stephanie Solomon Saint Louis University In Edwards' article, \"Regulating Clinical Science in a Public Health Emergency: Drug Discovery at the Bedside,\" she points to a central challenge for medical research. How can one ethically evaluate whether a drug works in a context where neither employing the standard research procedures nor abandoning them entirely are ethically acceptable?",
    "This is not a new question, and it has been posed in varying contexts, including research on emergency procedures, research in developing countries and research on rare conditions. Edwards focuses on a further challenge to standard research procedures where evidence and access are often in direct tension with each other: public health emergencies.",
    "She attempts to provide a means by which this ethical dilemma can be dissolved, and regulators can both gain reliable evidence on the safety and efficacy of new therapies and desperate patients can be given access to novel therapies in a timely manner. Edwards' first point is that the tightly controlled, rigorously staged, and cautiously distributed process by which therapies are normally evaluated are not appropriate in pandemic situations. She then argues that current approaches to adapting this process to ethical challenges, such as therapeutic privilege, parallel track, and compassionate/ emergency use, are not successful in public health emergencies, so another solution is required.",
    "Finally, she suggests that the best means to study new therapies and provide the quickest access to them is through cluster randomized controlled trials (cRCTs) which simultaneously study a therapy's safety and efficacy and distribute it to those who most need it in a population. The first important flaw in Edwards' argument is that she seems to believe that the current research strategy in which drugs are rigorously tested for both safety and efficacy before being accessed by the general public, or what she calls the \"precautionary principle\", is a strategy that sacrifices current patients for the benefit of future ones, or even the current health of patients for their future health.",
    "It is unclear whether she believes this is true merely in the case of pandemic emergencies, or in general. In either case, she disregards the primary intention of these precautions, which is to protect current patients from being harmed in the present by drugs with unknown safety profiles.",
    "In her chosen case of pandemics, these potential harms may be offset by the harms of the pandemic disease itself with no treatment, but it is important to note that this is a harm tradeoff within current patients, not a question of balancing present people and future ones. This misunderstanding is underlined by the author's frequent use of the term \"new therapy\" and \"new treatment\" for what is being Address correspondence to: Stephanie Solomon, Albert Gnaegi Center for Health Care Ethics, Salus Center, 3545 Lafayette, 5thfloor, St. Louis, MO 63104-1314.",
    "stesolom@gmail.com. I-NHPAAuthorManuscriptI-NHPAAuthorManuscriptI-NHPAAuthorManuscript Solomon Page 2 withheld by denying access to untested drugs before they have been through Phase III drug trials.",
    "The fact that it remains uncertain whether these drugs will be either therapeutic or actually treat the disease at issue (or treat it without causing more harmful effects), is why investigational drugs are not yet considered therapies or treatments. This confusion is further exemplified in her challenges that there is no equipoise in pandemic contexts, which importantly begs the question of whether there is deep uncertainty regarding whether an investigational drug will help, hurt, or do nothing at all. The important implication of this mistake is that her argument for increasing access during a pandemic should not focus on the importance of current sufferers over future ones, but rather the dire circumstances that make current risks so great that even a drug with uncertain safety is preferable to no drug at all.",
    "She makes gestures in this direction by distinguishing the original intentions of the regulations in the context of the harms of elixir sulphanilamide and thalidomide and those which she is concerned, where the investigational drugs are intended to combat \"deadly and communicable diseases.\" The second major issue with her discussion is that it does not adequately establish the failure of current attempts to resolve the issue of delayed access in desperate circumstances, namely: therapeutic privilege, parallel track and compassionate use.",
    "Each of these, in their own way, were developed to address the problem that she is pointing to, although she accurately points out that they are particularly focused on desperate individuals as opposed to populations. While they may all be insufficient individually to deal with the access issues of a pandemic, together they provide three venues for providing unproven drugs with promise to patients. Whether she is right that personalized medicine or short supply will make therapeutic privilege unhelpful, or that parallel track still requires an unsatisfactory delay in access are at least arguable.",
    "Unfortunately, her criticisms of compassionate use, or emergency use, are at the best unclear, and at worst fatally flawed. The author appears to believe that there is an intrinsic connection between compassionate use and the \"rule of rescue\" which she defines as binding physicians to save their patients in any way they can. She finds it problematic to use the justification for compassionate use, as it is normally applied to individuals in desperate circumstances, and apply it to the population desperation faced in a public health emergency.",
    "There are two major problems with this claim. First, according to the FDA, in order to qualify for access to investigational drugs outside of a clinical trial for emergency use, two criteria must be met.",
    "First, \"the patient must have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition and no comparable or satisfactory therapeutic alternatives.\" Clearly, people in a pandemic have contracted an immediately life-threatening disease and most often no comparable alternatives exist, so this first condition holds.",
    "Second, \"the drug manufacturer and the patient's doctor must make special arrangements to obtain the drug for the patient1.\" It is perhaps this second requirement that suggests to Edwards that compassionate use intrinsically depends on the notion of the \"rule of rescue\" between a physician and an individual patient. But although 1http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ByAudience/ForPatientAdvocates/AccesstoInvestigationalDrugs/ucm176098.htm Am J Bioeth.",
    "Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 August 19. I-NHPAAuthorManuscriptI-NHPAAuthorManuscriptI-NHPAAuthorManuscript Solomon Page 3 the doctor's judgment is invoked, this requirement is more for the protection of the patient, once again from the risks of being exposed to an investigational drug, than basing the obligation to provide it on the doctor's need to rescue.",
    "This implies that in a population context, someone's judgment (perhaps an FDA panel or other medical expert group) should decide whether the risks of providing access are outweighed by the risks of the threatening condition. Other than that, there seems to be no other aspect that doesn't translate directly to from the individual to the population level in the requirements for emergency use.",
    "Second, compassionate use has already been used at the population level during a pandemic. During the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for peramivir, a drug that is still undergoing phase iii clinical testing today2. It is puzzling that someone would argue that the compassionate use approach to providing access to investigational drugs in an emergency cannot be applied in a pandemic when it both can be used, and has been used in a pandemic situation.",
    "These important criticisms being noted, Edwards recommendation still makes a novel contribution to the conversation. She is right that during public health emergencies, neither the time nor the control needed for phased trials exist. She is also right that when faced with a life-threatening communicable disease, the normal cautious approach to taking an investigative drug should be relaxed.",
    "In light of these two points, she suggests a unique approach that utilizes, instead of struggles against, the public health realities of a pandemic. She creatively suggests designing clinical trials in a way that map on to the social realities of pandemics, namely that drugs are developed gradually, disseminated piecemeal, people are often geographically contained and put in quarantine, and surveillance is increased (what she calls \"non-pharmaceutical interventions\"). Taking these qualities of the pandemic landscape into account, she suggests a cluster design of trials where those who can gain early access to investigational drugs serving as the intervention group, and those who, due to practical realities and not FDA fiat, do not have access serving temporarily as controls, or more accurately as delayed treatment comparison groups.",
    "While this suggestion needs much more thought before being implemented, due to many of the challenges that Edwards herself brings up, the crucial point that she misses is the real relationship between her approach and the three current approaches of the FDA. She is wrong to argue that there is no way to provide people access to investigational drugs during a pandemic, the FDA has explicit measures to make it possible.",
    "But what her approach does is avoid the FDA's implicit either/or model. In other words, the FDA approach assumes that either investigational drugs can be studied in the proper scientific manner or exceptions must be made that sacrifice the science for the good of the people in emergency situations. What Edwards may not realize she does is explode this dichotomy and suggest that we get creative with our research designs so that good research can be done and the practical realities that people are facing, especially the dire realities of a pandemic, can be met. Instead of joining the tradition of science that sees the complexities of reality as a challenge to the purity of research design and the accuracy of data, she joins the growing movement of 2http://us.bestpractice.bmj.com/best-practice/monograph/1178/treatment/emerging.html Am J Bioeth.",

    "Ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins), designed by Molecular Partners, are a type of protein therapeutic to bind almost any target. \"In size it is more like a nanobody or single-chain antibody fragment,\" says Arne Skerra, at Germany's Munich Technical University.",
    "Another advantage is lower cost of goods. \"As DARPins are manufactured in Escherichia coli, they are much cheaper than proteins made in mammalian cells,\" observes Alain Beck, at the Centre d'Immunologie Pierre Fabre, Geneva. He rates the DARPins platform as one of the most advanced and interesting of several non-IgG-based protein scaffold platforms now emerging.",
    "The agreement includes taking Molecular Partners' MP0260, a molecule targeting both vascular-derived endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor to a human proof of concept, as drugs for age-related macular degeneration to compete in the same indication as Lucentis (ranibizumab) and Avastin (bevacizumab). The companies are also working on MP0112, a VEGF-targeting protein in phase 2b for retinal disease. Molecular Partners has DARPins in development in inflammation, oncology and other diseases.",

Susan Aldridge Biosurveillance plan unveiled President Barack Obama issued the first- ever National Strategy for Biosurveillance, a comprehensive plan for coordinating human, animal and plant disease surveillance efforts.",
    "Without calling for new programs, this plan, released in July, combines strategies already in place for \"gathering, integrating, interpreting and communicating\" information related to biological threats, diseases and natural disasters. The aim is \"to achieve early detection and warning,\" taking into account the overall situational awareness of an incident to enable better decision making. A schedule for implementing this plan is expected soon.",
    "Meanwhile, several bills before Congress, if passed, would undergird the biosurveillance strategy with legislative authority and would also authorize funding for several closely allied federal programs. They include the WMD (weapons of mass destruction) Prevention and Preparedness Act (H.R. 2356), for bioterrorism defense. Another bill, the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act (H.R. 2405), includes provisions for vaccines in the event of an influenza pandemic as well as for analyzing clinical specimens during outbreaks that might involve bioterrorism. Finally, the Foodborne Illness Reduction Act (S. 1529) would bolster the authority of the US Department of Agriculture to set forth and enforce food-safety provisions.",

By tracking changes in various chemi- cal indicators, including various ions and metabolites, imbalances can be caught before they become problems. \"Physicians use a number of different data points to make diagnoses about patients, but about 70% of the data they use to make an accurate diag- nosis comes from a set of 20-25 basic blood chemistry tests,\" says Pushpala. By tracking these parameters in real-time, their device could potentially warn patients of physical problems that they can remedy themselves, such as dehydration, or that will require prompt medical attention, such as kidney dysfunction.",
    "\"If you give people passive feed- back in an actionable manner, they are much more likely to change their behavior,\" says Pushpala. The company has already built prototypes, with an eye toward testing their patch with early users in the near future. In every respect, wearable sensors are a triumph over daunting technical challenges. For a patient lying in a hospital bed, per- forming an ECG reading is straightforward, but as soon as the patient begins running around outside a controlled environment, the signal gets marred with artifacts that make interpretation difficult.",
    "The devices need enough battery life to continuously generate and wirelessly broadcast data over extended periods of time. \"Our current gen- eration ECG patch uses 1 milliwatt of power to stream data via wireless connection to a smart phone,\" says IMEC's Penders, \"and it can operate from three or four days, up to a month, depending on what you do with it.\" This can also be balanced by using a lower sampling rate; for example, Dexcom CGM sensors transmit glucose data every five minutes even though higher frequencies are possible, enabling the transmitter to oper- ate continuously from six months to a year (although the blood sensor component must be replaced after seven days). IMEC and oth- ers are also exploring alternative modes of energy harvesting, such as from body heat or movement, which could power wearable sensors indefinitely without an external bat- tery, although considerable improvements in device energy efficiency--particularly with regard to data transmission--are still needed. Other critical issues remain.",
    "For example, in liberating patient data from the exclu- sive control of doctors and hospitals, sen- sor manufacturers have to ensure that these data stay secure and that users can control access to their personal health information. Also, as medical data begin to pour into everybody's laptops and smart phones, first as a trickle then as a torrent, companies will need to design interfaces and applications that enable patients and doctors to under- stand and interpret what they are reading. \"Physicians are going to be getting massive amounts of data, and how is that going to be analyzed and translated?\" asks Palin. \"And how do we get patients to take responsibility for maximizing their health, and what tools will help somebody who is really motivated to manage their chronic disease really well?\"",
    "As for software design, an 'open' philoso- phy embracing contributions from app- builders seems ideal for these sensors. Some of the best applications are likely to emerge from 'mash-ups' of different sensor feeds, and although most companies working in this area aim to ramp up the number of tests that can be conducted by a single device, there is a clear recognition that different platforms will ultimately need to play well together. Finally, unlike other medical devices which can be relatively clunky as long as they perform their intended function reli- ably, these consumer-facing systems must be comfortable and unobtrusive--pairing the medical technology expertise of estab- lished industry leaders like Medtronic with the user-friendly design instincts of the start- ups.",
    "\"Anybody who uses the words 'adher- ence' or 'compliance' should understand that these are not user problems--they're prod- uct problems,\" says Gandhi. \"We want to see more devices that really understand the user and how they go about their lives.\" The challenges ahead are huge but the payoffs could be enormous.",
    "Already two separate X-Prize challenges are underway to reward breakthroughs relevant to wireless medical sensor development: the $10-mil- lion Qualcomm 'Tricorder' X Prize and the $2.25-million Nokia Sensing X Challenge. Public health services and insurers could save big by minimizing hospitalizations and preventing repeat visits for the same ailment by helping patients to stay on top of their health. Finally, given the ever-falling cost of semiconductor chip manufacture, the com- bination of cheap wearable sensors and mobile-enabled doctor consultation could soon benefit even relatively remote commu- nities in the developing world. \"One of the first things anyone wants is healthcare for their family, and yet there's a shortage of phy- sicians and basic infrastructure in the devel- oping world that we would take for granted in the West,\" says Savage.",

    "The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a national, multistage probabil- ity cluster sample of the U.S. civilian, noninstitu- tionalized population, collects information on HCV infection. Based on analyses of NHANES data published over the last decade [1], a birth cohort of persons with comparatively higher prevalence of HCV infection was identified. Persons born from 1945 through 1964 account for an estimated 65.6% of all persons infected with HCV [1].",
    "The estimated prevalence of HCV infection in this birth cohort is 2.2 million. In 2010, the Institute of Medicine published a national strategy for the prevention and control of HCV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) [7].",
    "In response, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued an action plan for the prevention, care and treatment of viral hepatitis [8]. The HHS Action Plan contains specific strategies and screening recommendations including: implementing routine HCV testing of all persons for whom it is recom- mended as part of standard of care in a reformed health care system and improving linkage to care and treatment for HCV-infected persons. In 1998, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published recommendations for HCV screening among persons with behaviors, expo- sures, or clinically-defined risk indicators [9], which included: (1) persons who have ever injected drugs; (2) persons who received clotting factor concen- trates produced before 1987, were ever on long-term hemodialysis, or had persistently abnormal alanine aminotransferase levels; (3) recipients of transfusions or organ transplants prior to July 1992; (4) healthcare workers after occupational exposures; and (5) children born to HCV-infected women.",
    "Following more than a decade of scientific advances, the Division of Viral Hepatitis (DVH) is updating the 1998 recommendations through a two- stage process. The first stage will focus on develop- ing screening recommendations that can effectively target persons born from 1945 through 1965, a demographic that, as noted below, includes almost two-thirds of prevalent HCV infections. The second stage will entail a comprehensive update of the 1998 recommendations for HCV screening and preven- tion. Guidance will be targeted to clinicians and to professionals and agencies implementing HCV screening programs in community health centers, through health departments, and in other venues. To examine the evidence for a birth cohort screening strategy, DVH conducted a systematic review of HCV prevalence among persons born from 1945 through 1965.",
    "Seven databases were searched to capture peer-reviewed and grey litera- ture from 1995 through 2011 including EMBASE, PubMed, and Cochrane. In addition to conducting a systematic review, DVH adopted the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology for the devel- opment of these recommendations. GRADE pro- vides standards for a rigorous, systematic and transparent approach to the development of recom- mendations in two parts: evaluating the quality of the evidence and assessing the strength ofthe recommendations.",

The DVH Steering Commit- tee, working with a GRADE methodology consultant, led the process, conducted the systematic reviews, and assessed the quality of the evidence.",
    "The Internal Work Group consisted of staff from all divisional units (e.g., i.e., Laboratory Branch, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch, and Prevention Branch) of DVH. The External Work Group included represen- tatives from federal agencies (e.g., Department of Veterans Affairs, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration), primary care provider organizations (e.g., American Medical Association,TBM page 509 of 510 American Academy of Family Physicians), state and city health departments and advocacy groups (e.g., Adult Viral Hepatitis Prevention Coordinators, Na- tional Viral Hepatitis Roundtable), and medical spe- cialty organizations (e.g., American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, American Gastroenterological Association).",
    "Other experts including hepatologists, economists and guideline methodologists also partici- pated. The Internal and External Work Groups were involved from the inception of the birth cohort guidelines development process through regular teleconferences, in-person meetings and a half-day GRADE workshop. All members disclosed academ- ic and financial conflicts of interest using an established form from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (http://www.icmje.org/ coi_disclosure.pdf).",
    "Both work groups provided input and reviewed the scope, key questions, analytic framework, outcomes, systematic review methods and findings. Summaries of the findings from the systematic review and the results of earlier work group determinations of evidence on patient-important outcomes were presented at a two-day consultation with members of both work groups in August 2011.

    "This article, submitted to Health Services Research on February 6, 2001, was revised and accepted for publication on June 26, 2001. HSR: Health Services Research 37:1 (February 2002) The definition, developed by the ad hoc committee, states the following: ''Health services research is the multidisciplinary field of scientific investiga- tion that studies how social factors, financing systems, organizational structures and processes, health technologies, and personal behaviors affect access to health care, the quality and cost of health care, and ultimately our health and well-being. Its research domains are individuals, families, organizations, institutions, communities, and populations.''",
    "In some respects, the definition of this field has not changed since the early days when health services research emerged in response to health policy concerns regarding access to care and the costs and quality of care. The name ''health services research'' was formally recognized in 1966 through the establishment of a federal government health services research study section to review grant proposals. The field gained broader recognition and increased funding with the establishment in 1969 of the National Center for Health Services Research and Development in the (then) Department of Health, Education and Welfare, under the leadership of Dr. Paul Sanazaro. In the early 1970s, Dr. Sanazaro described health services research as a field that develops methods for improving access to care, moderating the rate of medical care prices, and assuring the effectiveness of care. At approximately the same time, the Report of the Panel on Health Services Research and Development of the President's Science Advisory Committee (1972) stated, ''Health services research seeks to improve the network for providing health care so that the fruits of biomedical research are readily available to all citizens'' (p. 1).",
    "In two reports, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academy of Sciences examined the status and future of this field and each time offered a definition. In 1979, the IOM report stated, ''Health services research is inquiry to produce knowledge about the structure, processes, and effects of personal health services'' (p. 14). In 1995, an IOM committee updated and expanded the definition to read, ''Health services research is a multidisciplinary field of inquiry, both basic and applied, that examines the use, costs, quality, accessibility, delivery, organization, financing, and outcomes of health care services to increase knowledge and understanding of the structure, processes, and effects of health services for individuals and populations'' (p. 3). The 1995 definition emphasized the multidisciplinary nature of the field, the range of basic to applied research, and the need to understand the effects of health services on both individuals and populations. In the definition recently adopted by the AHSR Board and then by the Board of the Academy for Health Services Research and Health Policy, the Health Services Research: An Evolving Definition of the Field scope of health services research interest is broadened further to include personal behaviors and social factors.",
    "Personal behaviors (e.g., smoking, use of seat belts, and diet) and social income, educational attainment, and occupation) are recognized as having important influences on the need for services and on the potential benefit or impact of health services on health status and well-being. The enumeration of research domains further emphasizes the breadth of the field and the important influences of families, organizations, institutions, and communities on the receipt of health services and health status outcomes. factors (e.g., The new definition will likely meet our needs for a few years. It is intended to indicate the range of factors that influences the need for health services, receipt of care, its quality and costs, and the health outcomes experienced by individuals and populations. Understandably, this definition is intended primarily for our research and policy colleagues and knowledge- able users of health services research.",
    "For the public, policy makers, and others who may know relatively less about the field, we need to devise simpler and more effective ways of communicating the content and value of health services research, as indeed this issue has been true for the past three decades. The board and staff of the Academy are developing new communication tools that will permit all those in the field to have a hand in educating the broader community of people who benefit from the products of health services researchers. Without doubt, however, we can and should expect the field of health services research will continue to evolve and we will need to revisit in years to come the breadth and areas of contribution described above.",

    "Abstract: Pandemic Electronic Benefits Transfer (P-EBT) benefits were intended for families of school children who lost access to free or reduced-price school meals (FRPMs) during the COVID-19 pandemic-related school closures. In high-poverty communities, all students from schools participat- ing in the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) were automatically eligible for P-EBT benefits; in non-CEP schools, only students already participating in FRPMs--for which their parents submitted an individual application--were eligible for P-EBT benefits. Using publicly available data from 105 K-12 public schools located in 4 sizeable low-income New Jersey (NJ) cities, this study investi- gated the association between school CEP participation status and the reach of P-EBT benefits for eligible students.",
    "A generalized linear model with a logit link, a binomial family, and robust standard errors was used. Across all levels of FRPM eligibility based on students' household income, as expected, almost all students from CEP schools received P-EBT benefits; significantly fewer received P-EBT benefits if they attended non-CEP schools, even when they were eligible for FRPMs.",
    "Our findings show that without changes to the qualification process for CEP, large numbers of eligible children will not receive the intended health benefits of federal meals programs or similar emergency relief initiatives. Expanding CEP eligibility and simplifying the process through which schools qualify would likely improve the uptake of federal meals programs and emergency interventions, and more effectively achieve their intent.

    "Introduction Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, 30 million school-age children participated in the USDA's National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and over 14 million participated in the School Breakfast Program (SBP) every day [1]. Students participating in school meals pro- grams have healthier diets, are less food insecure, and are better equipped to learn [2]. To encourage participation in school meals, the USDA introduced the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) as part of the 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act.",
    "CEP allows schools that serve predominantly low-income students to provide school meals to all enrolled students at no cost, without requiring individual applications from parents. Even though participat- ing in CEP reduces the administrative burden associated with collecting applications for free or reduced-price meals (FRPMs) and may increase revenue for school meals programs, a large proportion of eligible schools (30% nationally and 48% in NJ in 2020 and 2021) do not participate in CEP [3].",
    "COVID-19 restrictions compelled immediate federal action to address the challenges of providing meals to students in the face of extended school closures.

    "All students who received FRPMs were eligible to receive P-EBT benefits. Therefore, all students in CEP schools were eligible for P-EBT benefits, whereas only those students whose parents individually qualified them for FRPMs were eligible for P-EBT benefits in non-CEP schools. This analysis compares the P-EBT distribution immediately after the onset of the pandemic across schools with similar levels of students eligible for FRPMs but with different CEP statuses.",
    "2. Materials and Methods 2.1.",
    "Data Sources We examined the distribution of P-EBT benefits during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic using data from all public schools located in 4 large NJ cities (i.e., Camden, New Brunswick, Newark, and Trenton) with predominantly lower-income popu- lations (26-36% of individuals living below poverty in 2021) [5].",
    "De-identified data on the distribution of P-EBT benefits were obtained from the New Jersey Department of Human Services. Data were aggregated to calculate the total number of children who obtained the benefits at a school level. CEP participation status (SY 2019-2020) for all public schools in the study cities was obtained using Open Public Records Act requests from the New Jersey Department of Education.",
    "The school-level characteristics were obtained from the Common Core of Data for SY 2019-2020 from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). The main variables of interest from the NCES data were total school enrollment and total number of students eligible for FRPMs. These two variables were used to calculate the proportion of students eligible for FRPMs.",
    "Other variables drawn from the NCES were the race/ethnicity of enrolled students and the school level (elementary, middle, or high school). 2.2.",
    "Statistical Analysis The analyses were limited to 105 public schools that had complete information on CEP participation status and P-EBT distribution and were conducted using Stata 17. To model the proportion of students who received P-EBT benefits, a generalized multivariable linear model with a logit link, a binomial family, and robust standard errors [6] was used.",
    "The predictors were CEP status (yes/no) and the proportion of students who were eligible for FRPMs. An interaction between the two predictors was added to examine the differential association between the proportion of FRPMs and the proportion of P-EBT benefits by school CEP status.",
    "Adding other school-level controls--specifically, the race/ethnicity proportion and a binary indicator for primary vs. secondary (middle or high) schools--did not modify the results. After running the model, the margins post-estimation command returned the predicted proportion of students enrolled who received P-EBT benefits by school CEP status at different levels of FRPM eligibility. This study was deemed to be exempt by the Arizona State University and Rutgers Institutional Review Boards as it was entirely based on aggregate-level, de-identified, publicly available data.",
    "3. Results Less than half (44%) of the schools in the sample participated in CEP (Table 1), despite high levels of FRPM eligibility in both CEP (71%) and non-CEP schools (83%). Most schools in the sample, regardless of CEP status, were elementary schools. The most prevalent racial/ethnic groups were Hispanic (especially in CEP schools) and non-Hispanic Black.",
    "Figure 1 shows the predicted percentage of students receiving P-EBT benefits based on CEP participation status and the levels of FRPM eligibility of their schools, which was calculated from a generalized multivariable linear model using post-estimation commands.

The provision of P-EBT benefits--a key USDA response to the pandemic--reduced the food hardship of children by 30% in the week following the disbursement of the benefit [9]. A recent econometric study concluded that the P-EBT program was a cost-effective strategy for addressing food insecurity",

    "Nonetheless, our findings highlight the magnitude of the inequity resulting from the process of qualifying children for this crucial entitlement, as the likelihood of receiving P-EBT benefits during the pandemic depended on whether a student attended a CEP school rather than a non-CEP school. Notably, this disparity existed at all levels of FRPM eligibility; even when 100% of the students were eligible for FRPMs, there was a higher proportion of P-EBT benefits received by students in CEP schools than in non-CEP schools (99% vs. 92%, respectively). This suggests that expanding CEP eligibility and participation may help increase the reach of emergency assistance programs to families with the highest needs, contributing to reducing disparities in food access and improving health equity [14].",
    "A significant number of students attending non-CEP schools missed out on the P-EBT benefits despite being eligible for FRPMs. Differential P-EBT reach by school CEP status underscores the importance of new federal-level strategies for increasing CEP participation if the intended benefits of P-EBT, or similar policies in response to an emergency, are to be realized.",
    "For instance, there are marked state-level differences in the rate of CEP participation among schools eligible for CEP, with rates ranging from 14% in Nebraska to 93% in Vermont [15].",
    "Given the benefits to students associated with CEP participation of schools, ensuring that all eligible schools participate in CEP will constitute an important step toward improving the wellbeing of students. The recently introduced Child Nutrition Reauthorization bill--the Healthy Meals, Healthy Kids act--includes a provision for summer EBT cards to ensure families have access to resources aimed at providing nutritious meals for children when schools are closed during the summer.",
    "However, the process of qualifying for benefits replicates the experience of P-EBT distribution; as a result, unless efforts are made to increase CEP participation among eligible schools, a significant number of children from low-income families will miss out on benefits that can improve their nutrition and wellbeing simply because their CEP-eligible school did not participate in CEP. One limitation of the current study was that it was based on a sample of New Jersey public schools located in predominantly lower-income areas; therefore, the findings may differ in other contexts or states.",
    "Additionally, while we had data on the receipt of P-EBT benefits, we did not have information on how families actually utilized these benefits. 5.

    "Threading the needle: how to maximize the impact of new strategies to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission without harming existing services Benjamin H CHI, MD, MSc1, Harsha THIRUMURTHY, PhD1, and Jeffrey S A STRINGER, MD1 1 University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Chapel Hill, NC, USA Over the past decade, global efforts to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) have been driven by rapid progress in scientific discovery, policy, and program implementation. At the forefront of these advances has been the \"Option B+\" strategy to provide lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) to all HIV-infected women identified during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Initially developed as a strategy for settings in which CD4+ T- lymphocyte testing was not available, Option B+ is now endorsed by the World Health Organization and is being adopted widely.",
    "While there are many clinical and operational justifications for the strategy, successful implementation of Option B+ requires substantial new investments in health infrastructure. Concerns that introduction of ambitious new services may siphon already scarce resources away from other initiatives are legitimate and warrant a careful evaluation and policy response.1 Since Option B+ implementation is in its relatively infancy, there are presently very few data describing its impact on health systems. Work surrounding general HIV treatment expansion in Africa, however, may provide important insights.",
    "Several studies have investigated whether additional resources devoted to ART scale-up have adversely affected the delivery of other health services - a phenomenon known as \"crowding out\" in the economics literature - or whether they have instead bolstered health systems. At the facility level, the impact of such HIV programs have been mixed.",
    "In Zambia, for example, integration of ART services into the general outpatient department in two clinics was associated with significant increases in patient-provider contact time for non-HIV patients, but decreased contact for those requiring HIV care.2 In Tanzania, a program to integrate HIV testing into childhood immunization programs demonstrated a modest increase in vaccine uptake within four urban facilities, but a consistent decrease along similar indicators in four rural sites.3 Others have taken a broader approach, estimating associations between national health indicators and HIV service scale-up. Using publicly available data from the World Health Organization Statistical Information System, Duber and colleagues reported no differences in key indicators between focus and non-focus countries for the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) from 2000 to 2006.4 Three later studies - each with longer post-ART program follow-up - provide at least some support for the \"positive spillover\" Corresponding author: Dr. Ben Chi, Box 34681, 5032 Great North Road, Lusaka, Zambia; bchi@med.unc.edu.",
    "I-NHPAAuthorManuscriptI-NHPAAuthorManuscriptI-NHPAAuthorManuscript CHI et al. Page 2 argument.",
    "Bendavid, et al. found a larger decline in adult all-cause mortality in PEPFAR focus relative to non-focus countries; the point estimates for the effect on HIV-specific mortality was smaller, suggesting that positive spillovers could have occurred.5 Rasschaert, et al. demonstrated reduced morbidity and mortality in Malawi (2004-2009) and Ethiopia (2005-2009) following the expansion of their respective national HIV treatment programs.6 Grepin highlighted the complexities of these relationships when studying the impact of donor HIV funding on other health service delivery. From 2003 to 2010, she demonstrated a negative impact of HIV funding on childhood immunizations in sub-Saharan Africa, but spillover benefits in some maternal health services.7 While encouraging, it is important to note that these ecological studies have important limitations, especially in attributing causality.",
    "What will happen in the context of Option B+ implementation? While net negative consequences are certainly possible, the existing literature suggests the potential for broad positive impact as well.",
    "The likely influences on existing health services can be categorized as the result of either supply- or demand-side factors. Supply-side factors include aspects of health infrastructure: human resources, commodity security, physical clinic space, and medical training.",
    "Investments made by national governments and donor agencies to meet these needs can have important spillover benefits for the non-pregnant HIV-infected individuals, particularly in remote and rural sites where pre-existing ART access and health infrastructure may be limited. Alternatively, if resources required for Option B+ are redirected at the local or national level from other clinical services, then the supply-side effects of B+ may be negative, with adverse impacts within the health sector. Demand-side factors may also play a key role in determining the effect of Option B+ on broader health outcomes.",
    "By liberalizing eligibility criteria for lifelong treatment, Option B+ directly generates greater demand for ART among HIV-infected pregnant women and perhaps more generally for antenatal care services. Such a strategy may also indirectly increase demand for HIV testing and entry of non-pregnant HIV-infected adults into care through various mechanisms, including increased partner testing, reduced stigma and discrimination, intensified community education about HIV, and enhanced family-based care. Together, these influences could ultimately serve to reduce new HIV infections and improve population health.",
    "We advocate several broad approaches to maximize the impact of Option B+ while mitigating the risks to other health services. First, as policymakers plan to implement Option B+, there must be an emphasis on appropriate resourcing and realistic program targets.",
    "While enthusiasm for this bold PMTCT approach has reinvigorated global efforts to dramatically reduce pediatric HIV, a balanced implementation strategy that carefully manages the above-mentioned supply- and demand-side factors is critical to sustained success. Second, dedicated resources should be leveraged to further strengthen health systems integration.",
    "With Option B+, services for ART and PMTCT are more closely aligned than ever and this should be reflected in the types of structural investments made to support both.

A systematic map protocol Helen R Bayliss1, Stefan Schindler2,3*, Franz Essl2,3, Wolfgang Rabitsch2 and Andrew S Pullin1 Abstract Background: Invasive alien species are of global concern due to their impacts on biodiversity, related ecosystem services and on economy. A number of invasive alien species are also responsible for human health impacts, either as carriers (vectors) of pathogens, as causal agents of toxic or allergic reactions (e.g. to pollen or insect stings) or injuries.",
    "However, there has been relatively little attention given to these human health effects in invasion ecology literature, with no attempts to systematically identify and quantify evidence of impacts. It is likely that further invasive alien species will benefit from global change as some invasive traits provide high plasticity and therefore support adaptation capacities to cope with changing conditions.",
    "Thus, global change may lead to new public health concerns as invasive alien species expand their range or enter new areas, or may alter the severity of health impacts by changing the physiology or quantity of potential allergens or irritants produced. This mapping review aims at identifying any evidence for changes in the occurrence, frequency or severity of human health impacts resulting from exposure to invasive alien species in Europe over the last 25 years.",
    "Methods/Design: A systematic search of both ecological and medical literature will be used to identify potentially relevant studies using three a priori inclusion criteria, i.e. (i) affected human population in Europe, (ii) exposure to alien species, (iii) change in health impact.",
    "Studies will be assessed against inclusion criteria at title, abstract and full text to determine relevance to the mapping review. Studies deemed relevant will be coded using predetermined categories relating to the review inclusion criteria and study design, and recorded in a searchable database. Depending on the information available, studies may also be geo-referenced to create a geographic map of the evidence.",
    "Descriptive statistics will be used to explore key trends in the evidence base. The searchable database of studies and their main characteristics will be made available with the final report.",

    "4:10 Page 2 of 6 Background Invasive species have been associated with a range of health impacts, including injuries (such as bites, stings, scratches, rashes), transmission of diseases and parasites to humans as a vector or a reservoir, bioaccumulation of noxious substances, or through reactions to secondary plant compounds, toxins or allergen substances such as pollen [1,2]. Within Europe, over 170 species of mam- mals, birds and reptiles with accompanying parasites of human concern have established [1,3]. Several invasive plant species are also associated with health impacts. Some species, such as Ambrosia artemisiifolia, produce pollen that can trigger an allergic reaction with hay fever-like symptoms [4-7], while the sap of giant hog- weed Heracleum mantegazzianum leads to severe der- mal blistering and sensitivity to sunlight",
    "[8]. Invasive insect species may also pose a risk to human health: the Asian Tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus and several other Aedes spp.",
    "are effective vectors of human diseases such as Dengue Feaver and Chikungunya [9]; the Asian hor- net Vespa velutina has been accidentally introduced to France from China and is responsible for painful stings [10]; while some caterpillars, for example of the oak pro- cessionary moth Thaumetopoea processionea which has recently been introduced to the UK, produce irritating hairs that cause skin and respiratory complaints [11].",
    "Despite this, there have been no attempts to systematic- ally identify or quantify the extent of invasive species im- pacts on human health. Previous reviews suggest that research on this topic is biased towards a few species",
    "[12], hindering a balanced understanding of the scale, pat- terns and trends of these impacts [Schindler S, Staska B, Adam M, Rabitsch W, Essl F: Alien species and public health impacts in Europe: a synthesis, submitted]. Without this knowledge, it will be difficult to prepare appropriate and timely public health responses to emerging threats in the face of climate change.",
    "Globalisation affects invasive species through a range of mechanisms. Increasing transport infrastructures and the opening of new routes may lead to the spread of alien species and their diseases",
    "[13,14]. Climatic changes may affect transport and introduction mechanisms, fa- cilitating the establishment of new invasive alien species and altering the distribution and impacts of already present species and their responses to management [15].",
    "Invasive alien species are likely to benefit from climate change as some invasive traits provide high plasticity and therefore support adaptation capacities to cope with changing conditions [15-17].",
    "Global change may lead to new public health concerns as invasive alien species expand their range or enter new areas, or may alter the severity of health impacts by changing the physiology or quantity of potential allergens or irritants produced (Figure 1). An understanding of these potential changes is crucial for informing effective future public health pol- icies.",
    "This systematic map will form part of a wider project that synthesises evidence on emerging threats to human health from alien species in Europe under climate change and derives recommendations for environmental and medical mitigation. Objective of the review The aim of this review is to use recognised systematic mapping methods (e.g. Collaboration for Environmental Drivers of global change Change in distribution and abundance of health relevant invasive aliens species Change in health impact Response by society and policy: Global change mitigation Invasive alien species prevention and management Preventative medicine and medical treatment Figure 1 Drivers of global change cause changes in the distribution and abundance of health- relevant invasive alien species. These changes subsequently lead to a change in human health impact, the topic of this synthesis.",
    "Responses by society and policy aiming at the mitigation of global change and the management of invasive alien species are currently increasing, but still not implemented in sufficient amount to halt global change and invasions of alien species [25]. Thus, medical treatment of invasive alien species' health impacts is often required.",

J Gen Intern Med 24(6):776-8 DOI: 10.1007/s11606-009-0988-7 (c) Society of General Internal Medicine 2009 C omparative effectiveness research (CER), once only the scientific interest of clinical and health services researchers who compared medical treaments, now has tum- bled into the public arena. (1) Facing the need for drastic improvement in our nation's healthcare delivery, Congress and the Obama Administration are looking to CER to improve and broaden the use of treatments in a cost-effective way.",
    "Researchers, clinicians, professional societies, and policy experts have welcomed this, as they see CER as a scientifically rigorous way to select the most effective treatments for the benefit of patients and the public. On the other hand, while there has been support in the healthcare industry, apprehen- sion has surfaced among those whose products would be subject to evaluation of effectivness, including pharmaceuti- cal, biotech, and medical device companies, and among those who pay for treatments, including health plans, insurers, and large employers. Such concerns have translated into intense politics around CER--perhaps the best evidence that CER is truly likely to change practice and payment for medical care.",
    "This intensity also serves to remind us why, for CER, we must retain the usual standards and structures for medical research. Potential outcomes of CER include scientific knowledge, improved health, and financial impact.",
    "(2) In terms of science, across the spectrum of CER, from structured analyses of prior studies, databases, and registries, to the conduct of large clinical effectiveness trials, the scientific objective is rigorous reliable information about what treatments are best for what patients, and under what circumstances. Unless the conduct or public release of such research is compromised by poor quality or conflicts of interest, such information should have a direct positive impact on health.",
    "The economic consequences are less direct. For the nation, whatever the total costs of healthcare, CER should have a positive impact on cost-effectiveness--we would be spending healthcare dollars more wisely, on the most effective care, as concluded by detailed analyses by the Congressional Budget Office.",
    "for those who sell treatments, the consequences are mixed. Pharmaceutical manufacturers may benefit financially because CER will compare drugs to not only (3-5) However, Published online May 1, 2009 other drugs, but also to medical devices and procedures, which could expand the conditions for which their drugs might be used, and thus would enlarge their market. However, some new on-patent drugs may be found to be no more effective than earlier off-patent versions already generically available at far less cost, and this could compromise sales of their most profitable drugs.",
    "Similarly, for medical device companies, profits could be reduced. Because currently FDA's statute mandates less evidence of treatment benefit for medical devices than for drugs, a new requirement for rigorous testing of effectiveness would require extra time and money, and ultimately likely would show that at least some devices have undiscernable treatment benefits, which would curtail sales. These adverse effects on manufacturers' profits are the other side of the coin that should result in greater cost- effectiveness, which should be attractive to healthcare payers, including insurers, self-insured companies, and the govern- ment.",
    "Reliable well-accepted information on treatment effec- tiveness on which to base payment decisions would be very helpful. Moreover, that such information would be generated without insurers using their own funds, and without violating anti-trust rules against colluding with competitors about business decisions, but rather using public funds, is very attractive. However, the possibility that they may be mandated to provide access to treatments found to be effective and that their decision-making about payment would be potentially limited, based on such data, is of concern.",
    "These business concerns have generated political action. While expressing general support for CER, industry interests have conducted a two-pronged approach to alter CER legisla- tion.",
    "First, they want to be sure that cost-effectiveness is not part of CER. Manufacturers fear impediments to sales of their most profitable products, and healthcare payers fear impedi- ments to their healthcare coverage decisions. Manufacturers' lobbyists have pressured Congressional offices involved in healthcare policy that have included CER in proposed legisla- tion, insisting that cost-effectiveness analyses be specifically precluded from CER. Also, there has been a public campaign to raise fears about CER intended to influence Congress.",
    "For example, when in mid-February 2009 CER appeared likely to be part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, commentary and editorials on Fox News, the Wall Street Journal, and other outlets, and commentators such as Lou Dobbs and Rush Limbaugh warned that CER would lead to government restrictions in treatments based on cost, and that old people would be denied all costly medical treatments under JGIM Selker: Payments, and Politics: the Need to Retain Standards of Medical Research a new \"duty to die\" regime meant to save money, a type of government-mandated \"Nazi-style euthanasia.\" (6-8) The 2- year economic stimulus funding of CER was retained in this legislation, but the discourse gave a sample of what might be in store for the inclusion of CER in long-term healthcare reform. Second, if CER is to be done, industry wants \"stakeholder\" input into its conduct, and wants it not to be done at a current Federal medical or healthcare research agency.",
    "What are the alternatives? Currently, the private sector puts a relatively small amount of financial resources toward CER, focused on products or services of specific companies.",
    "The objectivity of this research is suspect, and, as has become too evident recently, results may be buried if not in concert with a company's objectives, even if they would have been helpful to the healthcare system and the health of the public. In comparison, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), already mandated by law to do CER, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), where CER is also done, both have long-standing high standards of research transparency and disclosure, with results available for public scrutiny. The credibility of these science agencies has led to acceptance of their findings by the medical community and dissemination of practice improvements, supporting improved care by all clinicians and payers.",
    "Despite this, business interests continue to press that CER not be done in these research agencies, but in entities such as a federally funded research and development center (FFRDC). This would allow governing input by industry stakeholders, and the entity would not be subject to the rules, regulations, and laws that govern the conduct of science at federal research agencies, and it would not be protected from political pressure.",
    "(1,9) Proponents of this approach state that AHRQ is vulnerable to political influence, but the fact that the proposed alter- natives are much more susceptible to industry influence reveals the real concern about keeping CER with other federally sponsored medical research in Federal research agencies--the possibility of lack of outside influence. (Of note, AHRQ's predecessor agency was slated for elimination in 1997 after subgroups in the orthopedic community became upset with a practice guideline it generated with regard to low back pain treatment and found a Congressional champion to seek elimination of the Agency.",
    "After that, wisely, the Agency instead focusing on stopped creating practice guidelines, compiling the evidence that others could use, the model for CER in a science agency.) In conjunction with this, AHRQ, currently the primary site for CER, has also been labeled as an example of an inefficient government agency. However, creat- ing a completely new entity and research infrastructure and processes to replace what already is in place doing this work as a highly respected science agency seems far less efficient; the true objective seems something other than efficiency.",
    "The stakes are very high--for industry, but also for the nation and for the public. There is ample recent history of industry influencing the public and government, and aborting or greatly modifying healthcare legislation. (10) There is a high road, a road that has made the biomedical research of this nation the best on the planet: the retention of the long- developed peer-review processes and increasingly strict protec- tions against conflicts of interest embedded in the operations of the NIH, AHRQ, National Science Foundation (NSF), and other Federal research agencies.",
    "On the other hand, industry concern about CER being done in a Federal research agency does have merit. Such research should generate information that will help those who make healthcare payment coverage decisions, and such research should not be restricted for political reasons, but payment for treatments should not be the purview of the science agencies--these decisions should be made by other entities under the extant rules for healthcare coverage. This leads to specific recommendations for the conduct of CER: (1) Comparative effectiveness research is research intended to affect treatments of people, and for that reason, like all biomedical research, it deserves to be done at the highest standards of science and free from conflicts of interest.",
    "Thus, it should be done at a science agency, not at a new hybrid entity that will have to build an entirely new science infrastructure and that will involve in its governance those with a direct stake in the results. Indeed, the latter risks a situation rife with conflict of interest and compromised scientific quality.",
    "However, public input to the research agenda is a social good, and should be sought. It is very reasonable that agencies doing CER and healthcare research have a high-level public/ private advisory board. However, it must not be a governing board, which would constitute an avenue for conflict of interest that scientists, clinicians, policy-makers, and the public would find objectionable. The AHRQ has the most broad experience and expertise for CER, and probably should be the lead agency for CER, but NIH also has a very important role to play, and both are likely to benefit from collaboration with the FDA, CDC, and other agencies.",
    "For example, based on these agencies' respective expertise, AHRQ could be responsible for research looking at effectiveness, harm, and safety done by analyses of current evidence, healthcare databases, and healthcare delivery, and NIH could be responsible for large randomized comparative effectiveness trials needed to accurately assess benefits of a treatment. A joint committee could coordinate these efforts, much as there is currently cooperation among program staff among the agencies for joint projects, and this would presum- ably be synchronous with the newly appointed Federal Coor- dinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research.",
    "Also, this link may be facilitated by the NIH Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSAs). With the mission of promoting of the wide spectrum of research that can improve the public's health, many CTSA institutions already have AHRQ CER centers [e.g., AHRQ Evidence-based Practice Centers, AHRQ/FDA Centers for Education and Research on Therapeutics, and AHRQ DeCIDE (Developing Evidence to Inform Decisions about Effectiveness)",
    "Network centers], and thus could be an excellent link to AHRQ around CER and a portal to NIH Institutes and Centers, and potentially to other agencies. (2) Coverage decisions (or selective reimbursement and/or differential cost sharing) should not be the purview of the CER done at these research agencies; those decisions would be made at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and other payers, as they are now. Presumably this will be addressed as part of the Healthcare Reform effort. Assessments of the effectiveness of treatments should be central to the output of CER; specific payment decisions about issues of policy, cost, equity, compassionate care, among many, should not be done in the research agencies.",
    "(10) This should be overseen by regulatory agencies under long-established procedures. Selker: Payments, and Politics: the Need to Retain Standards of Medical Research JGIM The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 contained $1.1 billion for CER activities at AHRQ and NIH.",
    "It was an excellent sign that the Government recognizes the importance of CER, and that its proper home is in a science agency, viz., AHRQ, in conjunction with NIH, where peer review processes and research infrastructure are in place to ensure the highest quality science. This will benefit the entire healthcare system and the public through promoting more effective care.",
    "As the impact CER might have on payments plays out in politics, it is important for the nation and its citizens that CER not be rent asunder from the rest of the biomedical research enterprise. The opportunity to broaden and improve medical practice for all deserves our best efforts.",

    "This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA DOI: 10.1111/1475-6773.12863 DEBATE-COMMENTARY Editorial Bringing Invisible Partners in Care out of the Shadows: Employment Effects of Informal Care Provision in Europe and Implications for the United States There are urgent calls in the policy advocacy community to expand supports to family and friend caregivers in the United States (called informal caregivers or family caregivers). Advocacy and legislative proposals from AARP and caregiver-specific groups such as the Family Care Alliance and National Alli- ance for Caregiving, along with Veteran and Military Service Organizations, have led to policy changes in recent years.",
    "Two recent policies are of note. The first, passed and implemented in three states to date, is paid family medical leave (PFML) (Brainerd 2016).",
    "PFML is paid through payroll taxes as a part of disability policy and allows 6 weeks of paid leave for qualifying reasons, including caregiving. Second, the Department of Veterans Affairs established a national caregiver support program for caregivers of veterans. Besides train- ing and supports such as respite care for all caregivers, more expansive bene- fits that include a stipend and health insurance are available for qualifying caregivers of veterans from the post-9/11 era who face significant limitations in daily life (Van Houtven et al. 2017).",
    "Beyond the direct effects on caregiver tasks and intensity, these policies may have unintended consequences to work behavior and future economic security (e.g., foregone Social Security and Medicare benefits) that should be included in the calculation of their net benefits. The calls to support the U.S.'s 18-24 million caregivers (Wolff et al. 2016) are not new, but there is more urgency today.",
    "Beyond the well-known aging of the U.S. population increasing demand for informal care, demand for informal care will increase because people are living longer with chronic HSR: Health Services Research 53:4, Part I (August 2018) illness and disability that requires assistance. And because Americans are both sicker and have more trouble than older adults in other industrial nations accessing health care (Osborn et al. 2017), family caregivers help fill the gaps in chronic disease management long before day-to-day assistance is needed in the home.",
    "Importantly, there is a limited social safety net to cover the long- term care needs of Americans. Private long-term care insurance is pro- hibitively expensive for most people, and people do not commonly plan against the risk of needing long-term care (Sperber et al. 2014).",
    "Thus, even though recent evidence shows informal care is not the preferred long-term care source by most Americans (Brown, Goda, and McGarry 2012), it will continue to be the default option. Compounding these factors, the Patient Pro- tection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 did not retain the long-term care insurance provision (CLASS Act) but did increase attention to care coordina- tion and transitions of care, which increases demand for family and friends to help. And in non-Medicaid expansion states, demand for informal care will be even higher, given lower access to publicly financed long-term care (Coe, Goda, and Van Houtven 2015; Sommers and Grabowski 2017).",
    "With little traction for expanding formal home care, and the increased expected demand for informal caregivers in coming decades amid numerous concerns that supply will not keep pace, the advocacy community has focused on a more tenable policy goal than expanding formal care: supporting infor- mal care. In 2016, the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medi- cine issued a report, \"Families Caring for an Aging America,\" which outlines recommendations for caregiver-friendly health care systems, a national strat- egy for caregivers, and supportive policies (NASEM 2016).",
    "AARP has been very successful in pushing forward supportive policies. The Caregiver Advise, Record, Enable (CARE) Act has been passed in 36 states and requires hospi- tals to record a patient's primary caregiver's contact information in the elec- tronic health record (eHR), to inform the primary caregiver when the patient will be discharged, and to provide training about tasks required once home (AARP 2017).1 As AARP put it, laws like The CARE ACT \"offer some basic support -- and common sense solutions\" (AARP 2017).",
    "Even Congress has brought attention to the issue of caregiving with recent testimonials from members about their own caregiving experiences to promote bipartisan Address correspondence to Courtney Harold Van Houtven, M.Sc., Ph.D., Health Services Research and Development Service, Durham VA Medical Center, HSRD 152, 508 Fulton Street, Durham, NC 27705; and Department of Population Health Sciences, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC; e-mail: courtney.vanhoutven@duke.edu. Debate-Commentary caregiver support bills (Rubin 2017).",
    "Notably, the bipartisan Recognize, Assist, Include, Support, and Engage (RAISE) Family Caregivers Act, also championed by AARP, was signed into law by President Trump in January 2018. Whereas the law provides no funding for programs, it mandates a national caregiver strategy, including an advisory council report within 1 year of the law's passage, as well as a national strategy issued within 18 months ( Jef- ferson 2018).",
    "In general, supportive caregiver policies are expected to expand training of caregivers, to minimize the well-known ill health effects caregivers experience, and to possibly reduce the financial strain of caregiving if work interruptions decrease. It is into this climate that Kolodziej, Reichert, and Schmitz's article appears in this issue of HSR.",
    "The question of how informal care affects work in Europe can inform our thinking about how more generous U.S. policies for informal care may affect U.S. caregiver labor force participation. Besides hav- ing an older population than in the United States across Europe, there are also important country-level institutional differences in long-term care financing and design, with Northern European countries having more public financing and access to formal care in the home and nursing home care, as well as poli- cies that directly compensate family caregivers (e.g., Germany). In Eastern and Southern European countries, supports are more modest.",
    "Importantly, Kolodziej, Reichert, and Schmitz (2018), control for the nonrandom selection into caregiving, focusing on the full age range of work- ing age adult children caregivers (20-65), and using data from most countries in Europe, their generous sample size allows them to look at whether male and female caregivers have differential labor market responses. The data source is the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe from 2004- 2013, modeled after the U.S. Health and Retirement Study.",
    "Kolodziej, Reich- ert, and Schmitz (2018) examine immediate changes in labor force participa- tion for caregivers of older parents who have a demonstrated need compared to noncaregivers. Demonstrated need for care was defined by either receiving some informal or formal help in the home or reporting a disability and is important to keep in mind because many other studies include a broader sam- ple of potential care recipients, for example, not restricting the analysis to those who have disability.",
    "The authors find that informal caregiving in the SHARE-represented countries reduces labor force participation on average by 14.0 percentage points. The empirical approach addresses the fact that adult children face a choice about whether they will become a caregiver or not. The authors use instrumental variables methods to ensure that the effect of informal care on HSR: Health Services Research 53:4, Part I (August 2018) work is not simply picking up the effect of being less interested in work (or sicker or something else) to begin with.",
    "This method pseudorandomizes adult children into \"caregiving\" or \"not caregiving\" states, by exogenous features of their family structure: number of siblings and whether a parent is widowed by recent death of the spouse. The inference possible in this approach, as the authors point out, is a local average treatment effect. That is, they estimate the labor market changes among those adult children invoked to provide care (or not) due to the availability of other sources of care in the family.",
    "Examining younger caregivers than most other studies, their findings highlight the limitations of past informal care and work studies, which focus on caregivers 50+. Ten percent of the SHARE caregivers were age 20-29; 23 percent were age 30-39; and one-third were age 40-49. If other studies, including those done in the United States by myself, Coe, and Skira (2013), had examined caregivers in the lower portion of the age distribution, they may have found more significant reductions in labor force participation.",
    "On the other hand, younger U.S. workers face incentives to remain in the labor force to ensure employer-sponsored health insurance for themselves and dependents, so the labor force effect could be smaller. As Kolodziej, Reichert, and Schmitz (2018) point out, by covering the full age distribution of workers, they may be uncovering an impact on a country's welfare hidden in prior work that focused on the 50+ caregivers. Indeed, labor market trajectories may be quite different for early versus late in life caregiving episodes (Miller 2011).",
    "Their model is fully interacted with male gender, and while males appear to be more likely than females to reduce work, which is counter to the expectation that males are more attached to the labor force than females, this finding is not statistically significant. The magnitude of the effect for males may be because more women work in part-time jobs, whereas more men work in full-time jobs. Thus, initiation of caregiving duties for men means that they may have to exit the labor force entirely because a move to part-time work is not an option.",
    "In addition to the above strengths, the key contribution of this paper is the authors examine different labor force effects by different institutional set- tings along the north versus east and south gradient. The authors find that neg- ative labor market implications of caregiving are more pronounced in Eastern and Southern European countries compared to Northern European countries. Besides cultural differences that may explain this trend, for example, more multigenerational households and less geographic mobility, there are dis- tinctly different policies that support caregivers by the N/E and S gradient.",
    "In Debate-Commentary the east and south, there are few publicly provided substitutes to informal care. Thus, the overall finding is driven entirely by the Eastern and Southern coun- tries and informal care in Northern European countries has no discernible effect on labor market participation.",
    "It is hard to disentangle the income effect (Northern countries are wealthier) from the generosity of long-term care pol- icy effect (Northern LTC benefits are more generous), but it is plausible that the specific policies that support long-term care or the more extensive social safety net in Northern European countries drive their finding. One must ask, what are the lessons for the United States from this work?",
    "Eastern and Southern European country informal caregiver supports are much more akin to the types of supports in the United States (Colombo et al. 2011). We should expect that more expansive policies to support long-term care, such as seen in Northern European countries, if they focus on formal care services, would overall increase U.S. labor force supply among informal care- givers.",
    "If supports allow direct payments to caregivers, however, such Ger- many enacted starting in 1995, then such a policy in the United States may decrease U.S. labor force supply, which is what happened in Germany, at least among male caregivers (Geyer and Khorfage 2017). One factor that may blunt the labor market response to caregiving in the United States, even in the pres- ence of supportive caregiver policies, is the fact that health insurance in the United States is still predominantly tied to employment for those under age 65.",
    "Thus, non-elderly U.S. caregivers face an additional barrier to reducing work due to caregiving demands on their time that European caregivers do not face--loss of insurance. The United States is nowhere close to having the policy supports avail- able in Northern European countries, but what can we learn from the three recent informal care policies described in the introduction about possible spil- lovers to labor market activities?",
    "Would the net change from these policies be neutral, positive, or negative to caregiver work behavior? Thus far, research in the United States that carefully considers causality shows that informal care among caregivers 50+ years old has modest negative effects on work, retire- ment, and wages, and the impact depends on the type of care provided and the caregiver's gender (Van Houtven, Coe, and Skira 2013; Jacobs et al. 2014).",
    "Because U.S. studies have not examined yet the full age distribution of care- givers in a national study, more research is needed to understand the full \"caregiving effect\" on work, as well as the \"policy effect\" on work. What might the policy effect be in the United States, with the advent of new policies to sup- port caregivers directly?",
    "HSR: Health Services Research 53:4, Part I (August 2018) PFMLA There are few evaluations of the Paid Family Medical Leave Act (PFMLA) effects on caregiver work. An early evaluation found \"no evidence to suggest that likely caregivers experienced changes in leave-taking, employment, or labor force participation after the implementation of the California or New Jersey programs,\" and that the main explanation was low uptake of the benefit (Morefield et al. 2016).",
    "Other analyses using actual participants are needed to examine trade-offs between informal care and work directly. A recent evalua- tion of California's PFML policy by Arora and Wolf (2017) showed that \"paid family leave reduced nursing home use by 0.65 percentage points, or in rela- tive terms, an 11% decline in nursing home use.\"",
    "They carefully addressed the threats to validity from the nonrandomized setting. Presumably, the mecha- nism through which nursing home use fell was that increased flexibility at work allowed family members to continue providing care and also prevented pay disruptions. Although not tested, the channel by which this occurred was presumably from more informal care.",
    "Examining labor market retention among caregivers directly is an important next analysis. VA PROGRAM OF COMPREHENSIVE ASSISTANCE TO FAMILY CAREGIVERS In a recent evaluation of the Program of Comprehensive Assistance to Family Caregivers (PCAFC), the program for post-9/11 caregivers, participating caregivers reported lower perceived financial strain compared to caregivers who did not participate (Van Houtven et al. 2017).",
    "The evaluation did not examine labor market effects of the policy. If the stipend and availability of health insurance led to labor market exits, then one needs to look at whether exits were temporary or permanent.",
    "If program participation helps facilitate a veteran's recovery, or allows a caregiver to invest in education, then the care- giver may later re-enter the labor force. Re-entry also likely depends on the veteran's ability to regain independence.",
    "Considering veteran recovery high- lights how complicated the \"spillover\" picture can be of any policy: PCAFC may increase some care recipients' own labor force participation, for example, through use of VA's supportive employment program. However, for severely injured veterans, it is likely the caregiver may face a permanent or many-year exit. Thus, the net benefits of this policy need to consider the income effect, Debate-Commentary the recovery effect for the veteran, the well-being effect on caregivers, and the work effect on caregivers.",
    "These three highlighted policies illustrate that any new caregiver sup- port policy will have unique effects on caregiver behavior and work behavior, and these changes in behavior need to be considered to assess net benefits. Skira (2015) authored the preeminent study of caregiving and work in the Uni- ted States and found that informal care reduced labor force participation among adult daughters. Her policy simulations showed that paid and unpaid leave policies were much more effective at keeping a higher proportion of adult daughter caregivers working full time after an intensive caregiving epi- sode, but that a more modest number remained intensively caregiving.",
    "By contrast, a generous ($27,000) caregiver allowance was very effective at keep- ing a large proportion of adult daughters intensively caregiving, but the trade- off was that there was an accompanying substantial reduction in the propor- tion of them who remained working full time.",
    "For reference, in the VA PCAFC program the annual tax-free stipend ranges between $7,000 and $28,000. These trade-offs should not be ignored given competing goals of the labor sector to increase female labor market participation and goals of health sector to minimize cost of long-term care provision (Van Houtven, Coe, and Skira 2013).",
    "In addition, is critical. These questions are paramount to evaluate proposed policy supports for caregivers, there is an urgent need for researchers to delve deeper into identifying who fares the worst from caregiving.",
    "Who fares the worst on the labor market and accompanying increasing economic insecurity? Who leaves for the short-term versus permanently? A continuing focus on gender, but combined with other features of vulnerability, such as poverty or underinsurance, to design optimal policy mechanisms that address goals of equity and fairness.",
    "For example, while 50 million Americans have taken Family Medical Leave Act leave since 1993, 78 percent of those who need leave do not take it because they say they cannot afford to take unpaid leave. What about impacts might respite care other support structures? What differential programs, consumer-directed programs where patients can pay the care- giver directly, or pension credits for caregivers have on work behavior and welfare, and whom would these policies differentially benefit?",
    "Detailing the winners and losers is an important gap in existing Euro- pean and U.S. studies, and this knowledge is needed to inform targeting of policy interventions.

    "The CARE Act could also have modest spillover effects on reduced caregiver labor force participation by demanding a greater role in post-discharge care coordination with the caregiver, which future evaluations should keep in mind. Because work dis- ruptions would depend on sick leave and duration of follow-up period after dis- charge, it is unclear whether the policy would be negative or neutral on work behavior a priori.",

Michael Drummond * Adrian Towse Published online: 26 October 2011 (cid:2) Springer-Verlag 2011 The chequered history of co-payments There are two general purposes of co-payments in health insurance systems, whether public or private. The first is to deal with the problem of moral hazard.",
    "Economic theory [1] tells us that to be efficient, health insurance cannot offer 100% coverage, so reducing the marginal cost faced by the patient to zero. The patient and their agent (the doctor) will consume health care until there is zero benefit, i.e. want all care that is effective irrespective of cost. Chalkley and Robinson [2] refer to this as the micro-efficiency challenge.",
    "Spreading risk has to be balanced by some co-payment.1 The second purpose is revenue raising, which can be thought of as seeking to reduce the cost to the third-party payer2 not by cutting use but by raising offsetting funds. Patients get the health care but the burden on the insurer is lower.",
    "There is of course a tension between these two objec- tives. If demand is inelastic then moral hazard is low and the co-payment will raise money. Conversely, if demand is elastic then co-payment will have a big impact on utilisa- tion and little revenue will be raised.",
    "Of course, if the purpose is simply to reduce cost to the third-party payer by M. Drummond (&) Centre for Health Economics, University of York, Alcuin A Block, Heslington, York YO10 5DD, UK e-mail: md18@york.ac.uk A. Towse Office of Health Economics, London, UK However, evidence suggests whatever means then either route is acceptable--lower utilisation or reduction in cost net of patient contributions.",
    "that co-payments are inequitable. If you make people pay then poor people donot take their medicine.",
    "Evidence from RAND Health Insurance experiment [3] found that as the level of cost sharing for healthcare services increases so utilisation (in inpatient stays, terms of probability of medicine use, admissions and outpatient visits) sharing reduced utilisation without regard for effectiveness. The impact on the utilisation of effective as well as medically inappropriate treatments was similar. Cost sharing was linked to poorer health outcomes and the impact on utilisation was greatest on groups with lower incomes. Therefore, both micro-efficiency and equity are harmed.",
    "Literature reviews in the 1990s [4-6] and in the last decade [7, 8] have all confirmed the key findings of the RAND study. falls.",
    "Cost Patient co-payments have, therefore, never been very popular with health economists from countries with so- cialised health care, because of their expected negative impacts on equity, without corresponding benefits in terms of increased efficiency. Writing on the use of user charges in the Canadian healthcare system, Barer et al. [9] con- cluded as long ago as 1979 that 'There is ... no support for any presumption that direct charges are a 'good thing'.",
    "In fact, the deck seems to be stacked against their successful deployment as a cost control mechanism or as a policy intended to help achieve other reasonable social program 1 We use the term co-payment and co-insurance interchangeably. They are both patient payments that reduce the coverage provided by the third-party payer.",
    "2 The term ''macro-efficiency'' is used for the related, but separate, issue of whether overall health system expenditure growth is reduced by cost sharing.",
    "M. Drummond, A. Towse objectives. ... 'It appears that the direct charge concept is indeed an idea whose time has gone. '3",
    "The central argument against the moral hazard case for co-payments is that decisions about appropriate treatment are made by informed doctors not by uninformed patients [10]. The challenge for the payer is to manage or incenti- vise the healthcare provider to use cost-effective treat- ments, not to charge co-payments and expect patients to respond in a way that better aligns the costs and benefits of care to the health system.",
    "However, pharmaceuticals are one of the few areas of healthcare service provision in which patient co-payments exist across Europe. Some countries, such as the United Kingdom, apply a small flat-rate charge per prescription item, although exemptions and total limits on expenditure apply. In other countries, such as France and Belgium, a percentage co-payment applies to some prescription items, with medicines for serious or life-threatening conditions being totally exempt from charges.",
    "Other countries such as Sweden operate an annual ceiling on the size of cumulative co-payments for all health services. Finally, in countries that operate therapeutic reference pricing, such as Germany and The Netherlands, patient co-payments apply in situa- tions where the market price of the medicine is higher than the reference price.",
    "However, in practice this rarely applies as manufacturers tend to drop their price to the level of the reference price, in order to avoid loss of market share. The recent case of atorvastatin in Germany is an exception to this rule [11].",
    "For a survey of co-payment systems in the European Union see Espin and Rovira [12]. A summary of their findings is set out in Table 1 below.",
    "In a review of evidence on the efficiency of co-payments for pharmaceuticals in Europe, Thomson and Mossialos [13] concluded that European evidence was limited by poor data, with the more reliable evidence we discussed earlier originating from studies in North America, which, in their view, gave rise to questions about generalisability to a European context. However, there was evidence of some impact on utilisation, although non-vulnerable groups were insensitive to price.",
    "Co-payments did not result in sustained reductions in expenditure growth. The authors suggested that European governments could consider greater use of differential charges, both to encourage the substitution of cheaper or generic for more expensive or branded drugs 3 Barer et al.",
    "[6] also argue that whilst co-payments may have some temporary effect of reducing costs to the third-party payer, over time co-payments will increase overall costs and hence income to producers. In their later review they point out that the design of the RAND study as an experiment meant it was not able to assess the impact on the health system over time of higher co-payments.",
    "They anticipate that suppliers would change behaviour in order to maintain incomes in the face of any fall in income arising from a fall in utilisation. Any macro-efficiency effect would be short term in duration.",

    "ing many governments, but more importantly because of the escalating cost of medicines in some clinical areas, most notably cancer. This has led to restrictions of access to new medicines in some countries.",
    "In turn this has led to debates about (1) whether such restrictions, based on an implicit or explicit consideration of maximum societal willingness to pay for health technologies, really reflect individuals' preferences and (2) whether patients should be allowed to pay an additional amount to gain access to drugs that are excluded from public reimbursement. For example, even in the United Kingdom, a country traditionally opposed to patient co-payments, the health ministry initi- ated a scheme whereby individuals could pay 'top-up charges' in order to be treated with certain cancer medi- cations that were not freely available within the National Health Service, although in this case the patient had to pay 100% of the cost of the medication [14]. If the role of patient co-payments for pharmaceuticals in Europe is to be reconsidered, it needs to be done within a policy framework that recognises the joint objectives of Is it time to reconsider the role of patient co-payments?",
    "efficiency, equity and budgetary responsibility. Namely, it does not make sense to impose charges that greatly dis- advantage individuals of a lower socio-economic status, or that deter individuals from seeking appropriate care which is cost-effective in the long run. Arguably we are now in or moving to an environment in which (1) healthcare payers are managing and incentivising providers to use cost- effective treatments and (2) rationing is becoming more explicit, related to the third-party payer's 'willingness to pay' for health gain and related benefits.",
    "In this context, we are moving between two different views of the world: In the old world view the patient and the prescriber make the decision.",
    "Moral hazard and 'expenditure' issues are ones to be directed at the patient (advised by the prescriber) in decision-making. Considerations of equity and efficiency limit the usefulness of co- payments In the new world view the payer manages access using VBP. There is rationing.",
    "The payer seeks to determine utilisation through use of practice guidelines and to prescribers, outcomes/activity-based incentives given price and expected health gain and other net cost/benefit effects. In the US, where co-payments are much higher for drugs and other healthcare services, Value-based insurance design (VBID) has been proposed [15] whereby low or zero co-payments are used for the treatments of known cost-effectiveness or where a patient is following a pre- scribed disease management pathway. Again the pre- sumption is that the payer is driving utilisation and so moral hazard is not an issue.",
    "Indeed, the concern is to avoid cost-effective reducing patient use of co-payments treatment.4 In a world of VBP and payer guidelines, co-payment therefore becomes a route to enable patients to gain access to drugs that the healthcare system does not think are cost- effective or which it thinks are cost-effective only at a lower price. In our view, health system efficiency is most likely to be found through the wider application of value- based approaches to decisions on the pricing and reim- bursement of medicines.",
    "A growing number of jurisdic- tions in Europe have been using assessments of the cost- 4 We can note that Pauly and Blavin [16] have argued that VBID (and value-based cost sharing more generally) is consistent with the conventional moral hazard approach to using co-payments. Theory already suggests that co-payments should discriminate between disease areas and patients [1]. However, Pauly and Blavin are in effect recognising that co-payments have no role in improving informed and are not driving efficiency if patients are not well decision-making, is more knowledgeable about incremental costs and benefits than the patient and is able to provide or deny treatment. the payer i.e. effectiveness of medicines in their decision-making.",
    "To date this has mostly focussed on reimbursement, leading to denial of access to some medicines through the public healthcare system or social health insurance package. However, some of the more recent proposals, such as those in the United Kingdom and Germany [17, 18] focus on the establishment of value-based prices for medicines in their various indications.",
    "the value-based price reflects the maximum societal willingness to pay, through the public healthcare system or statutory health insurance, for health technologies. Therefore, a possible role for co- payments would be for individuals to pay extra for medi- cines whose market price is set higher than the value-based price.",
    "In essence, National third-party payer systems inevitably trade-off diversity of population preferences with the equity benefits of operating a uniform package of benefits irrespective of income. In this situation, co-payment can become a way of recognising the heterogeneity of individual patient prefer- ences [19] whilst respecting the need for public and pri- vately funded health systems to restrict the treatments they can offer (or the prices they are willing to pay and by implication the treatments available if their willingness to pay is not accepted by the technology provider). The use of co-payments in a world of VBP would also deal with one of the other negative consequences, for equity, of applying co-payments, namely information asymmetry or uninformed consumers.",
    "The process of establishing a value-based price, at least under the pro- posals being discussed in the United Kingdom, would generate a wealth of information about the relative merits and demerits of alternative medicines, in particular the extra benefits (if these exist) of those products whose market price is set higher than the value-based price. This should enable patients, with help from their physicians, to make more informed choices among the various treat- ments, some of which would be fully covered, some of which would carry a co-payment.",
    "At first sight, this appears no different from the thera- peutic reference pricing schemes operating in Germany and The Netherlands. The most substantive difference is that the reference price (aka the value-based price) would not be set arbitrarily based on the price of the lowest-priced drug in the cluster, or an average price for the cluster. Rather it would be set as a result of a rigorous assessment of the value for money offered by different products, in relation to the societal willingness to pay applicable in the jurisdiction concerned.",
    "Therefore, equity of access would be maintained for all the medicines for which a value-based price can be agreed. On the other hand, if co-payments were also permitted, individuals whose preferences for health or health care differ from those embodied in the overall societal willingness to pay, could pay extra to gain M. Drummond, A. Towse access to medications that were not deemed to deliver enough social value for the cost. The residual challenges One potential downside of the proposed approach would be the administrative costs of collecting payments from patients.",
    "These costs are likely to vary from country to country and would be minimal in those jurisdictions already using ther- apeutic reference pricing, or other forms of co-payment. However, the main challenge is to minimise the chances that allowing patient co-payments (partial payments for reference priced drugs or total payments for drugs not listed for certain indications) means that low-income peo- ple may be denied access to some drugs. The third-party payer system sets willingness to pay for health gain at whatever level it wants or can afford.",
    "That will act as the indirect price control. However, companies will make strategic pricing decisions around this.",
    "For example, if the payer's value-based price is far below the manufacturer's pricing expectations, the company may decide on a pricing strategy that relies on substantial numbers of patients being willing to make co-payments. In such a situation, the poor would be denied access to care whether they were unable to afford to make the co-payments. On the other hand, the payer may be tempted to lower the willingness to pay threshold, and hence, the implied value-based price, in the knowledge that many patients would be willing to make the co-payments, rather than being denied access to care.",
    "(This would be analogous to an 'old world' use of co-payments as a method of off- setting the third-party payer's costs.) However, poorer patients, who may not be able to afford to make the co- payments, would again be denied care.",
    "However, if VBP is being applied in a rigorous and responsible fashion, both of these scenarios are unlikely. This is because the payer's willingness to pay threshold and the resulting value-based prices should be largely consistent with the values and preferences of the vast majority of the insured population.",
    "If this were the case, only a small minority of the population would be willing to make the co-payments. Indeed, if a substantial proportion of patients were willing to make the co-payments for a wide range of treatments, this would be a signal to the payer that the willingness to pay threshold was set too low in relation to community preferences. Conclusions In a world of VBP, it may be possible to use patient co-payments to deal with heterogeneity of preferences, without bearing the negative consequences for equity of access to care.",
    "Such a policy would give the signal to all parties that there would be guaranteed access to all medi- cines meeting the criteria used to establish a value-based price. Patients and physicians would be steered towards the therapies that deliver the most value for money, but there would be no restrictions on the access to other medicines for those willing to bear the co-payment. Arguably evidence would be available to inform patient choice, meeting the main requirement of Barer et al.",
    "[6] for user charges to be useful. They conclude that 'We do identify some limited and very selective potential roles for direct charges. In each case, the charges must be for a well- defined product about which consumers have sufficient knowledge to make informed choices'.",
    "We argue that such a role for co-payments recognises that healthcare choices within the third-party payer system are no longer at the discretion of the patient (the old case for using co-payments) but are driven by evidence-based clinical practice constrained by the need to use limited budgets on cost-effective treatments. Using co-payments for such cost-effective treatment risks reducing patient use of services the payer wants them to have (another 'old world' use of co-payments).",
    "The success of our approach would depend on admin- istrative feasibility and on the third-party payer's willing- ness to pay for health gain (as reflected in the value-based price) being set in a way that did not lead to large numbers of patients opting for treatments requiring co-payments.",

    "Next to this 'project approach' that targets a particular global health challenge with a specific SynBio product is the work James Carothers appearing in this issue, which sees the development of modelling and computer-aided design tools to facilitate a multi-use research platform. For him, such technological platforms make viable marketable products that can be 'reengineered to produce low cost global health materials' (Carothers this issue).

Landrain et al. examine the capacities of the Do-It-Yourself Biology movement to both practice SynBio around the global and participate in its (self) gover- nance, and Betten et al. lay out a social science Interactive Learning and Action methodology that can be deployed throughout the SynBio innovation process to better address the needs and requirements of global health users.",
    "The overall goal of this Special Issue is to increase our collective understanding of the practice of SynBio research and development for human health at the global level, and to better appreciate the role policy plays in enabling and/or constraining the responsible development of SynBio for global health. Our own contribution to the Special Issue works to summarize the dynamics between SynBio, global health, and global governance through the framework of 'responsible research and innovation' (Owen et al. 2012; von Schomberg 2013).",
    "In doing this we relate to the dif- ferent contributions of the Special Issue, and synthetize them in a comprehensive review. While all contributions here agree on the potentialities of SynBio to help address some major global health chal- lenges, all would also readily acknowledge the importance of taking into account features that are not directly related to the technological configuration of products. For this a multidisciplinary approach is needed, and we hope that we have provided the foundation for that here.",

    "The first time wemet was in 1978 at a conference inOsaka, but during the years after thatevent there were numerous meetings allover the world. For instance, I still re-member very vividly one other year thatI visited Tokyo, it must have been in1981, that I also met you and your -then still young - lovely daughters inyour home in Tokyo. They played theflute for us during that visit. The sec-ond time that I visited you in your homewas in 1998 when I was invited to makea tour in Japan to assess the current stateof affairs in medical informatics in yourcountry.",
    "I very well remember the longconversations I had with you and Kai onyour great interest in persons with amental handicap. After our visit we alsohad some correspondence on these issues. At all times that Kai and I have metthere was immediately a good under-standing. In 2007 we even had a jointpublication, as former IMIA presi-dents, together with Marion Ball, whichwas published in 'Methods'.",
    "My memo-ries of Kai are extremely positive, himbeing always very friendly and inter-ested in everything, also widely out-side medical informatics. Especially the conversations we hadin your home had a very personal char-acter, like me Kai and you being veryinterested in the meaning of human life.",

    "INTRODUCTION is an Under-reporting of occupational diseases important issue in many countries. Timely and complete reporting is fundamental to a successful physician-based public health surveillance system and to plan intervention programmes and alloca- tion of resources. For physicians, for under- reporting consist of lack of awareness regarding reporting requirements, time and effort involved in reporting and lack of benefit from reporting.",
    "the main reasons There are no systematic reviews of the effects of interventions for increasing the reporting (or redu- cing the under-reporting) of occupational diseases. Therefore, we conducted a Cochrane systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at increasing the reporting of occupational diseases by physicians.1 METHODS We searched the Cochrane Occupational Safety and Health Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, OSH UPDATE, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Open-SIGLE and Health Evidence, up to January 2015.",
    "We intended to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-RCTs, controlled before-after (CBA) studies and interrupted time series (ITS), on the effects of increasing the reporting of occupa- tional diseases by physicians, but we only identified RCTs and CBA studies. Outcome measures were the reporting of occupa- tional diseases measured either as the number of physicians reporting or as the rate of reporting occupational diseases.",
    "Two authors independently assessed study eligi- bility and risk of bias, and extracted data. The results of similar studies were combined in a meta-analysis. We assessed the overall quality of evidence for each combination of intervention and outcome, using the GRADE approach.",
    "RESULTS We included seven RCTs and five CBA studies in our review. Of the seven RCTs, five were reported in one article illustrating five intervention arms compared to one control each. The other two RCTs were described in a second article consisting of two intervention arms compared to the same control group. Seven conducted studies werethe Netherlands, four studies in the USA and one had been performed in South Africa.",
    "The interventions were focused on occupational physicians in seven studies and other physicians in five studies.in four studies evaluated Six studies evaluated the effectiveness of educa- tional materials alone, one study evaluated educa- tional meetings,a combination of the two and one study evaluated a multifaceted educational campaign for increasing the reporting of occupational diseases by physi- cians. Ten studies compared active interventions to no intervention, whereas the comparison group of two other studies was a less intensive intervention, which consisted of a message explaining the bene- fits of reporting. All the included studies were judged to have a high risk of bias.",
    "There was moderate-quality evidence from two studies that the use of a personally addressed elec- tronic newsletter describing the pros and cons of reporting occupational diseases did not increase the number of physicians reporting occupational dis- eases compared to no intervention, with a risk ratio of 1.11 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.67). We also found moderate-quality evidence from two studies that sending a reminder message of a legal obligation to report increased the number of physicians reporting occupational diseases when compared to a reminder message about the benefits of reporting (risk ratio of 1.32, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.66; figure 1).",
    "Specifically, this intervention consisted of a letter to the physician emphasising the legal requirement to report ( plus the benefits of reporting, in one of the two studies), an excerpt of public health law man- dating the reporting, a one-page flyer explaining that public health law requires physicians to report current and future patients by completing and returning the accompanying form, a brochure describing how to report and a listing of reportable conditions, and a reporting form with patient infor- mation from previous hospital records regarding a case with reportable condition that had not been reported by that physician. There was low-quality evidence from four studies that the provision of educational materials did not increase the rate of reporting when compared to no intervention.",
    "Likewise, we found that the use of both, educa- tional materials and meetings, did not considerably increase the number of physicians reporting occu- pational diseases nor the rate of reporting. Similar findings were found for the use of educational an educational meetings alone. The use of Curti S, et al.",

We did not find studies evaluating the effectiveness of internet-based interventions, simplification of procedures or techniques of reporting (eg, through online reporting), or the use of financial incentives.",
    "Moreover, no studies evaluating large-scale interventions, such as the introduction of new laws, existing or new disease-specific registries or surveillance systems, were found. DISCUSSION",
    "The included studies provided evidence ranging from very low to moderate quality showing that educational materials, educa- tional meetings, or a combination of the two, did not consider- ably increase the reporting of occupational diseases. The use of a reminder message on the legal obligation to report seemed more effective than a simple message about the pros and consof reporting occupational diseases.",
    "High-quality RCTs are needed to clarify the effectiveness of these interventions. There was very low-quality evidence that the implementation of an educational campaign increased the number of physicians reporting occupational diseases compared to no intervention.",
    "The evaluation of these large-scale interventions should be per- formed by ITS study designs where the outcome is measured several times before and after the intervention. The included studies had been conducted in three countries, only limiting the evaluation of the applicability of the results. The evidence from a very small number of countries would not directly apply to other countries, considering also differences in legislation between them.",
    "The type of participants involved in the review likely reflects issues and approaches used to increase the reporting of occupational dis- eases in the different countries. the different needs, This review did not evaluate the effectiveness of interventions other than education, such as the use of financial incentives, which could be an important form of motivation for changing physicians' behaviour. Such small-scale interventions could be investigated using larger RCTs, while the evaluation of large-scale interventions such as legislation should use an ITS design.",

    "Abstract Background World AIDS Day has been observed on the first of December every year. Whilst there are specific themes during the commemoration, the role of conflict on HIV seems neglected and needs prioritization given the rise of conflicts globally. Discussion The global HIV response brought substantial reduction of new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths, and increment of antiretroviral therapy coverage.",
    "Nevertheless, there is substantial inequity on the benefit of the response. Individuals with HIV in conflict zones have suffered immensely and are often neglected. The fact that the level, intensity, and number of conflicts is increasing mean more HIV people in conflict or post-conflict settings such as in Ethiopia, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Myanmar, Yemen Russia and Ukraine are at risk of negative HIV care and treatment outcomes. In particular, some conflicts such as the case of Ethiopia's Tigray have been marked by severe public and humanitarian crises, including medical siege, intentional damage of healthcare infrastructure, targeted attacks on health workers, displacement, and appalling incidents of conflict-related sexual violence. Yet, people living with HIV in these conflict settings seem often overlooked.",
    "It is crucial to address the unique challenges in these areas to achieve the goals of AIDS/HIV care. Conclusion There is no ideal forum to remind the intricate relationship between conflict and the HIV epidemic other than the World AIDS Day. Thus, this this year's World AIDS Day should focus on prioritizing on tackling the direct and indirect effects of conflict on HIV transmission and treatment.",

Keywords World AIDS Day, HIV, Conflict perilous medicine, Tigray Since 1988, World AIDS Day has been observed annually on December 1st. This day serves as a solemn reminder of the lives lost to AIDS-related illnesses, as well as a time to reflect on the progress made and to unite in enhancing our response to HIV/AIDS.",

    "Time to prioritize perilous HIV medicine. World AIDS Day 2023 is a time to acknowledge the mixed outcomes of the global HIV response. On a posi- tive note, the estimated number of new HIV infections reduced by 54%, ART coverage increased from one mil- lion to 28.7 million, and HIV-related deaths of 16.5 mil- lion people were averted between 2001 and 2021 globally [1].",

    "The year 2023 witnessed significant turmoil, including the escalation of tensions in Israel-Palestine, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the aftermath of the brutal 2020-2022 war in Northern Ethiopia's Tigray region. Moreover, ongo- ing conflicts in South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Myanmar, and Yemen continue to exacerbate the situation.",
    "Numerous other regions are also facing volatile conditions that could lead to further conflicts, underscor- ing the urgent need for attention to HIV in these crisis settings. Some ongoing and past conflicts have been marked by severe public and humanitarian crises, including the siege of medical facilities, intentional destruction of healthcare infrastructure, targeted attacks on health per- sonnel, widespread displacement, and appalling incidents of conflict-related sexual violence, often accompanied by the deliberate transmission of HIV [2]. A poignant example is the Tigray conflict",
    "[2], where an estimated two million people were displaced, approximately 70-80% of health facilities were deliberately damaged, health work- ers were targeted, and industrial-scale sexual violence against women and girls was reported.",
    "In such humani- tarian crises, exacerbated by poverty, access to HIV test- ing, treatment, and prevention is critically hindered, leading to increased disease transmission and spread [3, 1]. Additionally, the trauma and social upheaval caused by these conflicts can lead to higher rates of risky behav- iours like unprotected sex and drug use, further height- ening the risk of HIV transmission. Yet, the needs of people living with HIV, as well as HIV care continuum programs, are often overlooked in con- flict settings.",
    "Addressing the unique challenges in these areas is crucial for the effective management of the global HIV epidemic. It's imperative to establish concrete, col- laborative efforts that integrate HIV prevention, testing, and treatment services into humanitarian responses in conflict zones.",
    "Additionally, addressing conflict-related sexual violence and the breakdown of social structures is essential to halt the further transmission and spread of HIV. World AIDS Day 2023 should be a crucial reminder of the intricate relationship between conflict and the HIV epidemic. To tackle both the direct and indirect effects of conflict on HIV transmission and treatment, a concerted effort from the international community is essential.",
    "This effort should focus on designing effective, multidimen- sional response strategies. If perilous HIV medicine is given priority, we can achieve considerable progress in reducing the HIV burden in the world's most vulnerable regions. Such efforts are key to fulfilling the promise of ending AIDS by 2030.",

    "Public Health Nutrition: 20(18), 3225-3227 doi:10.1017/S1368980017003330 Commentary Sugar-sweetened beverage tax: the inconvenient truths An increasing number of countries and jurisdictions around the world have introduced regulatory measures to curb consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB). In 2017 alone, Portugal, Brunei, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Thailand, the Catalan region of Spain and five US cities introduced a tax on SSB, with planned 2018 SSB tax implementation for the UK, the Republic of Ireland, South Africa, Estonia and the US city of Seattle, Washington(1).",
    "In Australia, a large number of public health, academic and consumer groups now support the introduction of a tax on SSB(2). However, political support has been limited, with only one party - the Greens - developing a policy platform supporting a tax in Australia(3).",
    "The intended benefits of an SSB tax are fourfold: (i) an increase in the retail price of SSB would reduce consumption and produce public health benefits; (ii) generation of sub- stantial revenue, which could be reinvested back into public health; (iii) communication of a powerful message that regular consumption of SSB is not part of a healthy diet; and (iv) incentive for manufacturers to reformulate to lower-sugar products (if tax is tied to the amount of sugar contained in the beverage). Although political momentum for a tax on SSB is growing internationally, it faces stiff opposition by indus- try.",
    "For example, the American Beverage Association spent more than $US 2 million in the city of Berkeley, California and more than $US 9 million in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania opposing an SSB tax(4). Opposing measures included the saturation of cities with anti-tax advertising to the proposal and filing sway public opinion against multiple lawsuits to repeal the tax (with the appeal from the American Beverage Association reaching the state's in Philadelphia)(5). While this was not Supreme Court enough to defeat the tax at the ballot box in Berkeley and Philadelphia, industry has worked tirelessly to convince both the public and decision makers that a tax on SSB is poor policy.",
    "In Australia, the Australian Beverages Coun- cil, the peak lobby group for sugary drink companies, has targeted key politicians and political parties to 'keep a tax off the policy table'(6). Further they acted to form a 'sugar roundtable' made up of groups that could potentially be impacted by a tax, including peak advertising, sugar, cane growers, advertisers and business groups, to actively oppose consideration of a tax by politicians(6).",
    "Two-thirds (63*4 %) of Australian adults and one in four (27*4 %) Australian children aged 5-17 years are classified as overweight or obese(7). Strong scientific evidence, from prospective studies and randomized controlled trials, implicate regular SSB consumption with an increased risk of long-term excess weight gain for both adults and chil- dren(8).",
    "Consumption of sugary drinks is also a key risk factor for tooth decay in children. In Australia, one in two 12-year-old children presents with dental decay in their intake(7), of which SSB adult teeth from free sugar this free sugar(9).",
    "Daily contribute approximately half consumption of SSB increases the risk of developing dia- betes by 26 % compared with occasional SSB con- sumers(10) and has been implicated in a number of other non-communicable diseases(11). Approximately one-third of Australian (aged >=2 years) reported consuming SSB in the 24 h prior to the 2011-12 National Health Survey, with the highest consumers(12).",
    "children and adolescents Despite these alarming statistics, both major political par- ties in Australia have rejected the idea of an SSB tax. As countries around the world debate an SSB tax, proponents must be armed with strong and consistent evidence-based arguments that both justify the policy and counter opposing sentiments. This is critical for advocacy efforts to ultimately influence political decisions.",
    "While the public health community has been diligent in justifying an SSB tax, consistent counterarguments are often fragmented and incomplete. Here we present the key opposing arguments against an SSB tax (put forth by the Australian Beverages Council) with corresponding counterpoints (see Table 1).",
    "While the arguments and counterpoints have been developed from an Australian perspective, these are likely to be transferable more generally across the world, particularly within other high- income countries. The economic, social and health benefits of an SSB tax are strong.",
    "This now is recognized by many reputable health bodies around the world(13). No longer can the pursuit of profits be prioritized over concern for the health of our children and young people.",

    "Table 1 Opposing arguments for a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) by the Australian Beverages Council and counterpoints Opposing argument Counterpoint Free sugar consumption is declining and SSB contribute a small amount to the overall diet(14) The focus on SSB is unjustified(15)",
    "There is limited support for a tax on SSB(14) Similar taxes in other countries have failed(14) A tax on SSB will be regressive and hit the poor the hardest(14) A tax on SSB will harm business and cost jobs(12) Free sugar consumption remains unacceptably high Australians consume on average 14 teaspoons sugar/d, with half of all Australians (mostly children and teenagers) aged >=2 years exceeding the WHO recommended limit for sugar intake (10 % of total energy intake; approximately 12 teaspoons sugar/d)(12) Teenage boys, the highest consumers, consume almost double the WHO recommendation (22 teaspoons sugar/d), with the top 10 % consuming in excess of 38 teaspoons/d(12) Sugary drinks contribute approximately half of all free sugar intake in the average Australian diet(12)",
    "One-third of all Australians (aged >=2 years) consume sugary drinks regularly (classified as consuming an SSB in the 24 h prior to the day of the survey)(7). In 2011-12 this included one in three children aged 2-3 years, a time when taste preferences and eating behaviours are being moulded for the rest of their lives SSB are the largest source of free sugar in the daily diet(12) SSB contain little to no nutritional benefit and are not compensated for in the diet by eating less food(16) Drinking SSB leads to increased preference for other sugary foods(17)",
    "SSB can be easily defined as a category for taxation More than twenty jurisdictions around the world have now implemented a tax on SSB(18) 69 % of Australians support the policy if the revenue was reinvested back into health(19). Successful SSB taxes in the USA have been determined by citizen ballot votes(18)",
    "A number of public health and consumer groups support the application of a tax on sugary drinks(13) Evidence from Mexico shows that a 10 % tax on SSB can reduce their purchase by up to 12 % one year post policy implementation(20), with sustained impacts after two years Claims by industry that SSB sales have rebounded (by 0*2 %) in Mexico in 2015, two years post SSB tax implementation, are based on data that do not take account of population growth in Mexico, which is increasing at a rate of 1*2 % per year Any impact that an SSB tax may have on obesity rates is likely to be small and the effect will take several years to measure. Regardless, a tax on SSB should not be viewed as the only element to address obesity and chronic disease.",
    "A comprehensive approach including a range of interventions will be essential to make a meaningful impact on the population prevalence of obesity. A poor diet is a leading risk factor for the global burden of disease, globally, and any improvement to population diets (i.e. via a reduction in SSB consumption) will be a positive step to improve health While low-income households are likely to pay more in tax, as a proportion of their household incomes, compared with high-income households, this difference is estimated to be modest at less than $US 5 per year(21)",
    "A higher burden of disease and greater responsiveness to an SSB tax among lower-income households(20) will result in progressive health benefits and long-term savings in individual health-care expenditure(22) Reinvestment of revenue into interventions that benefit lower socio-economic strata would further enhance the positive impacts for disadvantaged individuals and families Evidence demonstrates a shift in demand to non-sugary drinks following the implementation of an SSB tax(20); this increased production of non-sugary drinks is likely to minimize job losses in the beverage industry.",
    "Modelling studies support this(23) Analysis of changes to employment following the SSB tax in Mexico demonstrated no change in employment in the non-alcoholic beverage manufacturing industry and a negligible increase in employment in commercial establishments that sell foods and beverages(24) The reinvestment of revenue will create jobs in other sectors The beverage industry is committed to be part of the solution.",
    "Maintaining an energy balance between what is consumed throughout the day and what is burnt off holds the key to maintaining a healthy weight(15) The beverage industry has an unavoidable conflict of interest as a publicly listed company. These companies have a legal obligation to act in the interests of their shareholders and maximize sales and profits to the full extent permitted by law The industry has funded research to obfuscate the evidence, run campaigns with a focus on physical activity and supported recommendations that are relatively weak and ineffective as alternatives to stronger action by government(25,26)KBackholerandJMartin Commentary 11.",

    "Risk prediction models, using either machine learning or statistical algorithms, can act as inputs of a cost-effectiveness model when predicting costs and effectiveness of an intervention. This systematic review has two objectives: to evaluate methodo- logical quality of the published models to predict diabetic coronary heart disease (CHD) risk; to evaluate whether the models were suffi- ciently reported to judge their applicability to the cost-effectiveness modelling.",
    "Methods. A targeted review of journal articles published in English, Dutch, Chinese, or Spanish was undertaken in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Explore from 1 January, 2016 to 31 May, 2021.",
    "To assess the methodological quality and reporting of the models, we used PROBAST (Prediction model Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool), CHARMS (a Checklist for critical Appraisal and data extraction for systematic Reviews of prediction Modelling Stud- ies), and a checklist (Betts 2019) summarizing the application of cardiovascular risk prediction models to health technology assessment. Results. Our search retrieved 6,579 hits, of which 18 models were eligible for inclusion. Among them, four studies developed machine learning models (2 recurrent neural networks, 1 random forest models, and 1 multi-task learning model) while 14 studies developed statistical models (8 Cox models, 5 logistic models, and 1 microsimu- lation model).",
    "More than 70 percent of models were of high meth- odological quality in aspects of participants (89%), predictors (72%), and outcomes (72%), while only five models (28%) in aspects of statistical analysis. For the reporting, only two models provided sufficient evidence in all aspects (i.e., participants, predictors, and outcomes) for judging their applicability to the cost-effectiveness modelling. Most models were reported sufficiently regarding parti- cipants (78%) and outcomes (72%), but only three models regarding predictors (17%).",
    "Conclusions. To apply the CHD risk prediction models to cost- effectiveness modelling, concerns remain regarding the potential risk of bias due to inappropriate use of analysis methods, and regarding insufficient reporting on how to measure and assess the predictors. PP39 Evidence Generation",
    "For Reimbursement Of Digital Health Applications (DiGAs) In Germany Naomi Fujita-Rohwerder (naomi.fujita-rohwerder@iqwig.de) and Stefan Sauerland Introduction. In 2019, the German government established a new evaluation procedure for digital health applications (DiGAs) to facilitate their reimbursement by statutory health insurance.",
    "The procedure involves the assessment of a DiGA's \"positive healthcare effect\", which is defined as a medical benefit and/or \"a patient- relevant improvement of structure and processes\". If the available clinical evidence is insufficient to prove the manufacturer's claim on the positive healthcare effect, but the claim seems plausible, the DiGA is provisionally reimbursed, and further clinical evidence within twelve months must be generated.",
    "DiGAs eligible for provisional or permanent reimbursement are publicly listed in the DiGA directory. In contrast to the usual pathways for reimbursement of healthcare technologies which involve IQWiG as the national HTA agency and the G-BA (Federal Joint Committee) as the decision-making body, the DiGA procedure is currently carried out by the national competent authority (BfArM) and thus outside the joint self- government. Furthermore, legal evidence requirements for DiGAs are comparatively low.",
    "Methods. This work analyzed the suitability of clinical studies that intended to prove a DiGA's medical benefit. For this purpose, the key elements for clinical studies published in the DiGA directory and clinical trial registries were extracted and compared with the usual evidence requirements in the reimbursement context.",
    "Results. As of October 2020, 20 DiGAs have successfully undergone the application procedure. Fourteen DiGAs (70%) were provisionally accepted.",
    "A randomized controlled study (RCT) design was chosen for all clinical studies to be conducted for further evidence generation. However, in four cases (28%), it is questionable whether the clinical study is suitable to demonstrate a medical benefit mainly due to the choice or operationalization of the primary endpoint (n=2), the timing of the endpoint survey (n=2) and/or the choice of the control intervention (n=1).",
    "Conclusions. Even though all currently ongoing or planned clin- ical studies with DiGAs are RCTs, not all of them are adequate to demonstrate a medical benefit according to the usual evidence requirements.",

Poor rural patients have difficulty accessing the drugs, making the provision of antiretroviral therapy inequitable.",
    "Initial tests of community-based treatment programs in Uganda suggest that home-based treatment of HIV/AIDS may equal hospital-based treatment; however the literature reveals limited experiences with such programs. The research: This intervention study aimed to; 1) assess the effectiveness of a rural community-based ART program in a subcounty (Rwimi) of Uganda; and 2) compare treatment outcomes and mortality in a rural community-based antiretroviral therapy program with a well-established hospital-based program. Ethics approvals were obtained in Canada and Uganda.",
    "Results and outcomes: Successful treatment outcomes after two years in both the community and hospital cohorts were high. All-cause mortality was similar in both cohorts. However, community-based patients were more likely to achieve viral suppression and had good adherence to treatment.",
    "The community-based program was slightly more cost-effective. Per capita costs in both settings were unsustainable, representing more than Uganda's Primary Health Care Services current expenditures per person per year for all health services. The unpaid community volunteers showed high participation and low attrition rates for the two years that this program was evaluated. Challenges and successes: Key successes of this study include the demonstration that antiretroviral therapy can be provided in a rural setting, the creation of a research infrastructure and culture within Kabarole's health system, and the establishment of a research collaboration capable of enriching the global health graduate program at the University of Alberta.",
    "Challenging questions about the long-term feasibility and sustainability of a community-based ARV program in Uganda still remain.

    "Globally, there are 33 million persons living with HIV infection (PLWHIV). Uganda, with one mil- lion PLWHIV, ranks as a high HIV prevalence country. The increased availability of antiretroviral treatment (ART) for HIV/AIDS in low income countries has chan- ged the clinical management of PLWHIV and has dramatically increased rates of survival.",
    "Improved availability of ART is intended to benefit all PLWHIV eligible for treatment. However, in reality ART services in developing countries are mainly offered in urban-based hospitals.",
    "Thus poor patients living in rural areas cannot access them due to economic and geo- graphic constraints. This inequity in providing ART services is a crucially important issue for health care policy makers and practitioners.",
    "In Uganda, the roll-out of ART services to rural areas, where 80% of the popula- tion lives, cannot be accomplished by health care workers alone. This is due to the extreme shortage of trained health professionals, which currently remains the biggest single obstacle to the expansion of ART services in Ugan- dan and all of sub-Saharan Africa.",
    "This health personnel shortage is the most acute in rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, the roll-out of ART services to rural populations requires alternative approaches, one of which could be the engagement of communities and community resources.",
    "Various treatment models involving community resources have been developed and tested in Uganda. These include a home-based treatment program in Tor- oro [3], a home-based treatment program in Jinja [4] and a home-based treatment program in Kampala, which used PLWHIV on treatment as volunteers for outreach",
    "[5]. All three programs have shown that home-based treatment is as good as hospital-based treatment.",
    "In gen- eral, however, the literature reveals that there are limited experiences with community-based ART programs. The research The objectives of our intervention study were: 1) to assess the effectiveness of a rural community-based ART program in Rwimi subcounty, Kabarole district; and 2) to compare the treatment outcomes and mortality in the rural community-based ART program with a well estab- lished hospital-based ART program offered at a best practice urban hospital in Kabarole district.",
    "The study was undertaken in Rwimi subcounty (population 25 000) which is located in the Kabarole district, western Uganda, 50 km away from the nearest hospital offering ART. This study required less material input (e.g. bicycles vs. motor- cycles) than other studies previously done in Uganda which may increase the chance that this model can be replicated using available health sector resources. The study was a cohort study with a non-randomized intervention design [6]. The study population consisted of a cohort of PLWHIV receiving community-based ART established in a health centre III (run by a clinical officer) in a rural sub-county in Kabarole district and the com- parison population consisted of a cohort of PLWHIV receiving ART from the best practice hospital (run by physicians) located in an urban area in the district.",
    "In each cohort, all HIV patients presenting themselves to the hospital and the rural clinic for treatment were sequentially recruited after the project commenced. Only those patients were enrolled who were eligible for treat- ment according to the Ugandan HIV treatment guide- lines.",
    "Each cohort was followed up for two years to compare mortality and ART outcomes between the cohorts. In the community-based cohort 185 patients were sequentially recruited and in the hospital-based cohort 200 patients were recruited. Several sub-studies were conducted, e.g. gender impact on treatment results, quality of life of community-based patients on treatment, cost-effectiveness of community-based and hospital- based treatment models.",
    "Forty-one lay community volunteers agreed to partici- pate in the pilot and were provided with training on ART. The motivation of the unpaid volunteers was based on an intrinsic desire to support access to treatment for their fellow community members and was reinforced through the recognition and support they received from the health care program and the community.",
    "Volunteers were asked to make weekly visits to their patients, during which time they monitored adherence to treatment, through pill counts, as well as assessed the presence of adverse reactions. Volunteers were asked to refer those with clinical problems and/or adverse reactions to ARVs to the clinical officer at the health centre. On a monthly basis the volunteers obtained a supply of ARVs from the local health centre and delivered these to their assigned patients. At the time of recruitment, patients were also asked to identify a family member/friend as their daily treatment supporter to help with the daily intake of the drugs.",
    "The first line antiretroviral drugs, provided free of charge by the Ugandan national HIV/AIDS program, consisted of stavudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine. Outcome measures of the study were: 1) mortality, HIV- 1 RNA viral load (VL) per ml and increase in CD4 cell count/ul which were assessed after two years of starting ART.",
    "Statistical procedures included descriptive, univari- ate and multivariate analysis. Logistic regression models assessed the association between successful treatment out- come (VL<400 copies/ml) and clinical and demographic variables.",
    "The AIDS-related survival of hospital and Kipp et al.

Ethics approval was provided in Canada by the University of Alberta's Health Research Ethics Board and in Uganda by the School of Public Health, Makerere University, Kampala and the Uganda National Council of Science and Technol- ogy, Kampala. Each participant was informed about the study and signed a consent form. Limitations were: 1) the study was not designed with a randomized study design because randomization simply was not feasible; 2) the loss of patients for follow-up, including due to mortality, was relatively high (30% in the community-based cohort vs 29% in the hospital-base cohort).",
    "Results and outcomes No patient in the study was reported to have had severe adverse reactions which required a change to second-line treatment. Seventeen patients in the community-based cohort developed a skin rash (6 patients in the hospital- based cohort) and 25 community-based patients reported suffering from mild peripheral neuropathy (50 in hospital- based patients) which did not warrant a change in medica- tion.",
    "Successful treatment outcomes after two years in both the community and hospital cohorts were high. How- ever, in the community-based cohort, HIV patients were more likely to achieve viral suppression. CD4+ cell counts increased similarly in both cohorts.",
    "All cause mortality was similar in community and hospital patients after the two year time interval. Community-based patients had excellent overall adherence to treatment at rates through- out the study period (adherence was not consistently mea- sured in the hospital cohort).",
    "Almost all patients on treatment in the community-based cohort reported a sig- nificant increase in their overall quality of life, as measured by a standardized health-related quality of life (HRQL) questionnaire [7]. Women benefited more from the community-based ART program, as more women sought treatment than men (58.3% were females).",
    "In addition, in the first six months, women had better treatment outcomes in terms of successful suppression of the VL compared to men [8,9]. However, this difference in the treatment outcome between men and women decreased after two years and was not statistically significant in the longer term.",
    "An indirect benefit for women and their partners was that all seven children born to treated women in the community cohort were HIV negative after testing, sparing them and their families the additional burden of caring for an HIV- infected infant. When program costs were calculated for both, the hos- pital-based and community-based treatment model, the cost-effectiveness per successful treated HIV patient was slightly better in community-based HIV patients. How- ever, the overall program costs per year per patient in both programs (approximately 100 US$ including the cost of drugs) were at a level that could not be sustained by local Primary Health Care (PHC) Services in Uganda which currently spends on average between 10-20 US$ per person year for all health services.",
    "This suggests that the expansion and long-term maintenance of ART programs will require long-term external funding. The ART treatment model with unpaid volunteers and clinical officers/nurses in charge of serving patients referred by the volunteers has shown to be sustainable for the two year period that this program was evaluated.",
    "This is best illustrated by the low attrition of volunteers, as only two volunteers left the program. The recognition efforts by our project and the community were obviously felt by the volunteers to be valuable and very positive. The low attrition and the effective participation of ordin- ary community members as unpaid volunteers led us believe that this model can be sustained, if the required resources for their supervision, recognition and motiva- tion can be provided.",
    "In contrast to popular belief that volunteer programs are cheap, our cost calculations showed that this is not the case, even though the cost- effectiveness per successful treatment was slightly better in the community treatment model compared to the hos- pital model. Challenges and successes The main success of this study was the demonstration that ART can be provided to rural HIV patients closer to where they live. Our community-based treatment model involved unpaid community volunteers, supported by non-cash incentives, training and supervision and who were connected to a local health centre staffed by clinical officers and nurses. The treatment outcomes of this model were equivalent (and even slightly superior) to the treatment outcomes of ART in the best-practice regional hospital in the district. As ART was delivered through the existing rural Ugandan health care system with mini- mal additional material and human resources, it can be a feasible model for replication on a larger scale, e.g. dis- trict wide.",
    "Another success was that a research infra- structure and culture of research has been created amongst the health system leadership in Kabarole district and a cadre of trained and capable research assistants has been established. This has already led to new applied research initiatives of the Kabarole District Health Man- agement Team (DHMT) to generate new information required for better addressing the major health problems in the district such as malaria, tuberculosis, and repro- ductive health. Finally, the foundation of these collabora- tions and the field site in Uganda was instrumental in the establishment of the first graduate program in global health in Canada at the University of Alberta in 2005.",
    "Despite these successes, some challenges remain, related to the longer term sustainability of the program. Kipp et al. BMC International Health and Human Rights 2011, 11(Suppl 2):S12 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-698X/11/S2/S12 Page 4 of 5 Questions that are raised and need to be answered include: 1) Can the DHMT in Kabarole continue with this program successfully on its own?",
    "2) If this program is to be replicated, what are the fac- tors to be considered to influence successful implemen- tation on a larger district or region-wide scale and which modifications have to be made from the original smaller pilot program?",
    "The partnership This project is a continuation of previous successful colla- borative HIV/AIDS work in Uganda by the School of Public Health, Makerere University (MU), the School of Public Health, University of Alberta (UofA), the Kabarole Health Department (KHD) and the Kabarole Research and Resource Center (KRC). This partnership started in 1997 between the Department of Public Health Sciences at the UofA and the Department for Epidemiology and Biostatis- tics, Institute of Public Health, MU.",
    "The role of MU and UofA was to collaboratively design the study, apply for funding and supervise the project implementation in Uganda. The KHD's role was to implement the grant under the supervision from MU and UofA which was somewhat unique to a research project, since the research implementation team usually consists of researchers and not health care workers. We decided to implement this study in the context of a rural health clinic with involve- ment of the local and district stakeholders in health care. Our hypothesis was that if the research project was already integrated in a practical health care setting with local involvement, it would be much easier for the health care workers to use the research results.",
    "Our aim from the beginning of the study was that the intervention, if suc- cessful, should be continued as the method of service pro- vision to guarantee future ART to all patients enrolled. With this study design of integrating the research project into the local health services, we felt confident that this project could be more easily handed over with better pro- spects of successful continuation through the local Pri- mary Health Care services. The special role of the KRC, whose mandate in the district is to plan and deliver on community-based projects for the underserved population, was to support the role of the community volunteers and the community itself in the ownership of the project.",
    "This concept of integration distinguishes our research project from many other research projects which don't strive for a continuation after research funding has ended. In the past our Ugandan-Canadian collaboration has been very successful in attracting funding from diverse funding agencies (Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), the International Development and Research Centre (IDRC), the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) and the Government of Alberta) with some $3 million obtained in research and development funding.",
    "We were diligent from the beginning to establish a multi-disciplinary research team which would enable us to cover a wide range of perspectives in community- based/population-based research initiatives. Disciplines we included were global health, health administration, public health, nursing, epidemiology and biostatistics, clinical (tropical) medicine, social sciences, gender equality, health economy, adult education, communication, etc. We also tried as much as possible to include qualitative and quali- tative research methods in our proposals.",
    "The basis for the successful joint work of this partner- ship has been the mutual respect and trust among the var- ious collaborators which was built over the years through substantive and persistent efforts. Important was, espe- cially at the beginning, the development of personal rela- tionships which was only possible through on site visits and practical collaborative work.",
    "Effective and regular communication, which we did often in person and by phone, is a must. It is very difficult in our opinion to establish research collaborations only by electronic com- munication. If personal relationships have been estab- lished, then online communication works much better and is feasible. Our collaboration over the years was very unproblematic with only a few minor incidents.",
    "For our volunteers in this project, the liaison between themselves, their communities and an external foreign institution like the UofA was particularly appreciated, which contributed to their high motivation and low drop out rate (only two volunteers have left the program to date after four years). This strong sentiment around the value of external rela- tions was expressed by the volunteers in many informal encounters with us and also in formal research results.",
    "Our experience in this and other research/development projects in sub-Saharan Africa has shown us that the con- tinued external links such as ours (which may include only very limited funding) are indeed a crucial ingredient to a sustained partnership and realized to project outcomes. Another way to link developing and developed countries could be the establishment of formal or informal partner- ships between Canadian (external) and developing country towns, schools, and other interested groups. There is a huge potential and interest in Canada for this which has not been fully explored and which needs to be further developed and harvested.",
    "This experience leads us believe that an ongoing long term partnership model for development is what is needed. This is in contrast to the development model in many international development agencies which favours a time limited collaboration and a so called \"handing over\" of project activities to the developing partner with- out further financial support. It is well known that this short-term model has failed in many development/ research projects, since projects \"handed over\" to the Kipp et al.",

The expanded use of health information----an inevitable step in an information age----is widely considered be essential to health system reform.",
    "Models exist for the creation of data-sharing arrangements that promote proper use of information in a safe and secure environment and with attention to ethical standards. Data stewardship is a concept with deep roots in the science and practice of data collection, sharing, and analysis. Reflecting the values of fair information practice, data stewardship denotes an approach to the management of data, particularly data that can identify individuals. The concept of a data steward is intended to convey a fiduciary (or trust) level of responsibility toward the data. Data governance is the process by which re- sponsibilities of stewardship are conceptualized and carried out.",
    "As the con- cept of health information data stewardship advances in a technology-enabled environment, the question is whether legal barriers to data access and use will begin to give way. One possible answer may lie in defining the public interest in certain data uses, tying provider participation in federal health programs to the release of all-payer data to recognized data stewardship entities for aggregation and management, and enabling such entities to foster and enable the creation of knowledge through research. Health services research rests on the twin assumptions that good evidence can be created from health and health care data on patients, providers, and health care systems, and that these data will be available. This article focuses on the Health Services Research Data Governance and Stewardship second assumption, examining both the concept of data stewardship as well as the considerable legal barriers to data access and use that can exist, even when stewardship is present.",
    "A central policy question in the coming years is whether the growth of stewardship capabilities, coupled with increased ex- pectation of evidence-informed health care providers and consumers, will combine to lessen or eliminate these barriers. An intense struggle over health information access has been a hallmark of the health care system for decades.",
    "Advocates of greater data access insist on the need for data at the patient, provider, and health care system level, in order to advance understanding of quality, efficiency, safety, and health (McGlynn et al. 2003). Opponents raise a host of concerns, citing patient privacy, the confidential nature of the patient/professional relationship, and health infor- mation security. Naturally, opponents also are focused on their own interests, given the potentially deleterious impact of uncontrolled data access on their liability under a host of civil and criminal laws, as well as on their competitive market position.",
    "Indeed, a study of more than 500 HIPAA Privacy Rule cases found that one of the most common types of cases involved providers who resisted releasing health data to their own patients out of liability concerns (Rosenbaum et al. 2007). Despite the fact that shielding information from patients or failing to make use of information carries liability risks of its own (Institute of Medicine 2001; Rosenbaum et al. 2005; Rosenbaum and Painter 2010), health care providers and health plans tend to fight against broad health information transparency (Beckerman et al. 2008; Terry 2009). If laws governing data access are to evolve, a key consideration will be the ability to demonstrate data stewardship, that is, the existence of mechanisms for responsibly acquiring, storing, safeguarding, and using data.",
    "Permitting greater access to data for the creation of knowledge about how the health system works will depend on whether policy makers are able to strike a balance between the importance of health information to society on the one hand and the need to protect legitimate patient and provider interests on the other (interests that actually may work at cross purposes, at least when con- sumers, patients, and payers want more accessible information about network provider performance) (Cartwright-Smith and Rosenbaum 2009). Part of the equation in striking this balance will be whether data used for research can be safely and securely handled, so that evidence can be created Address correspondence to Sara Rosenbaum, JD, Department of Health Policy, George Wash- ington University, 2021 K Street NW, Suite 800, Washington, DC 20006; e-mail: sarar@gwu.edu HSR: Health Services Research 45:5, Part II (October 2010) without compromising these legitimate interests.",
    "The evolution of health in- formation storage and use technology, discussed elsewhere in this collection, has made the effort involved in trying to strike this balance more worthwhile perhaps, because it is now possible to manage research in safe and secure data enclave environments. The question becomes how long the social and legal realignment will take in order to assure full use of this technology, a question that has arisen in health policy many times before, as new technologies alter the health care landscape. Indeed, technology transformed social expectations regarding the professional standard of care itself, producing enormous changes in the law as a result ( Jacobson 2006).",
    "This time is no different, and indeed, the health information technology provisions of the American Re- covery and Reinvestment Act of 20091 (which included the HITECH Act), coupled with health reform's focus on efficiency, performance improvement, and comparative effectiveness research, suggest a quickening of the interest in health information. Indeed, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PSL 110-148) places a premium on health information to create the knowledge that is essential to improving quality, reducing cost, and promoting population health.",
    "DATA STEWARDSHIP AND GOVERNANCE DEFINED: INSIGHT INTO STAKEHOLDER VIEWS The concept of data stewardship is rooted in the science and practice of data collection and analysis and reflects the values of fair information practice (Diamond et al. 2009).",
    "Data stewardship denotes an approach to the man- agement of data, particularly data, however gathered, that can identify indi- viduals. Data stewardship can be thought of as a collection of data management methods covering acquisition, storage, aggregation, and deiden- tification, and procedures for data release and use.",
    "The concept of a data steward is intended to convey a fiduciary (or trust) relationship with data that turns on a data manager whose loyalty is to the interests of individuals and entities whose data are stored in and managed by the system. Data governance is defined as the process by which stewardship re- sponsibilities are conceptualized and carried out, that is, the policies and ap- proaches that enable stewardship. Data governance establishes the broad policies for access, management, and permissible uses of data; identifies the methods and procedures necessary to the stewardship process; and establishes the qualifications of those who would use the data and the conditions under Data Governance and Stewardship which data access can be granted.",
    "With the advice of system stakeholders, stewardship prioritizes resource investment into the knowledge creation deemed essential to health system reform. Experts have posited that health data stewardship necessitates entities that acquire, hold, and aggregate information, releasing it for use in research. Stewardship of health information data compels ''trust and competency; adoption of technology; and new models for data exchange (and new skills for managing health information) that include the patient as part of the data supply chain. ''2",
    "Health data stewardship rests on critical assumptions: first, that it is possible to gain access to data; second, that data stewardship will deal with identifiable patient and provider information; and third, that research protocols and technology exist to enable the safe and secure use of personal health data, such as research protocols that avoid the creation of large, static data bases susceptible to leaks or tampering.3 Insight into how stakeholders view data stewards can be gleaned from public comments in response to a 2007 request for information (RFI) focusing on a national data stewardship project, which was issued by the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality (AHRQ). The comments shed light on stakeholder positions regarding the need for and value of data stewardship entities with the capacity to both manage data in a safe and secure manner while also assuring proper governance over matters of data policy.",
    "The 2007 RFI represented AHRQ's effort, acting under its broad agency mandate, to enable the types of technology advances that would in turn help improve health care quality.4 The RFI sought information on the establish- ment of a national health data stewardship entity (NHDSE) to support a per- formance measurement and reporting effort of the type recommended by the Institute of Medicine (2004) in an earlier report. The RFI sought stakeholder public comments regarding the structure, functions, and roles of a data stew- ardship entity (the terms ''stewardship'' and ''stewardship entity'' were left undefined). AHRQ sought input on the characteristics and functions of an NHSDE, identifying a series of areas of agency interest, including public-private governance, mission, and the adoption of ''uniform operating rules and stands for sharing and aggregating public and private sector data on quality and efficiency.",
    "''5 AHRQ also sought input on the entity's role in guiding the '' implementation of . . .",
    "national operating rules and stan- dards'' and in providing ''a framework for collecting, aggregating and ana- lyzing data, to afford means of more effective oversight of health care data analyses and reporting.. .''6 AHRQ thus envisioned an entity that, in addition to acting as a data repository and manager, would possess policy making HSR: Health Services Research 45:5, Part II (October 2010) functions, advising public agencies in standard-setting regarding the acquisi- tion, management, and use of health information, as well as on priority matters for research.",
    "The RFI envisioned an entity apart from AHRQ itself and possessed of certain powers, including the power to collect and hold data and the power to advise agencies on research priorities and on the methods and approaches to be used in evaluating the data. In this sense, the entity would go beyond the technical functions of a repository and would enter the realm of policy devel- opment and advisement.",
    "Reflecting this desire to go beyond technical aspects, AHRQ posited a series of proposed precepts: objectivity; independence in governance; knowledge-based conduct and procedures; responsiveness; trust- worthiness; adaptability; transparency; timeliness; collaborative style; and sustainability.7 ARHQ sought input into the need for and value of such an entity: its roles and responsibilities; key challenges and risks in creating and sustaining the entity; the entity's potential role in characterizing and evaluating the ''comprehensiveness, accuracy, and reliability of shared and aggregated health care quality measurement data''8 stakeholder governance models; meth- ods for assuring the avoidance of conflicts; priority areas of activity; and whether existing organizations might be suitable to perform such a role. The responses from the field were notable both for the number of com- mentators and the breadth of their responses.",
    "In all, AHRQ received 136 responses (24 from organizations or corporations and 112 from individuals).9 The responses, as summarized by AHRQ,10 illuminated a range of viewpoints regarding a health information data steward with a potentially expansive role. Commenters offered variable understanding of a data steward, includ- ing its definition, duties, mission, and functions. No clear group of proponents or opponents emerged.",
    "Consumer groups appeared to both support and oppose to the stewardship concept, as were health data information organi- zations, quality review organizations, payers, governmental agencies, and the health care industry. On the threshold question of need for an entity, views ranged consid- erably. Proponents viewed a broadly conceived steward as offering an essen- tial oversight mechanism for health data issues, organizing the various data collection, aggregation and sharing systems, assuring privacy, empowering consumers, and fostering collaboration among stakeholders.",
    "Opponents ob- jected to a stewardship entity as an unnecessary competitor; others raised concerns about the absence of clear legal authority on which to act.11 Others opposed the entity on more fundamental grounds related to the impact of such an entity on health care. Data Governance and Stewardship Commenters viewed data stewardship functionalities relatively nar- rowly, encompassing data storage and administration of data use ''rules of the road.'' Numerous commenters viewed the entity as bringing no added value to the health information enterprise, indicating that private sector data managers already were doing a good job, again underscoring the proprietary interest in data control and access.",
    "Specific opinions on entity roles ranged from the granular (e.g., the entity could carry out quality review activities) to the broadly conceptual and collaborative, such as working with various stakeholders to set priorities, procedures, and standards for data collection, sharing, analysis, and use. The comments evidenced tension over whether a data steward should take on standard-setting and policy making functions or simply carry out technical responsibilities related to data collection, aggrega- tion, and use.",
    "In other words, there was no consensus over whether a steward would be a policy actor, a consensus builder, a standard setter, a technician, or all of the above. With respect to the question of public/private collaboration, comment- ers voiced concern over the potential conflict between government as both a health care regulator and a health information and performance standard- setter.",
    "Some commenters viewed government as identifying sources of data, building consensus around standard performance measures, and providing guidance on data collection, aggregation, and use methods. At the same time, numerous commenters viewed the private sector as the actual data collectors and information producers, underscoring the proprietary interest in data.12 Few commenters offered views on entity structure and governance, focusing instead on technical functions rather than on questions such as the process of governance (i.e., whether such an entity should have the public access trappings of a formal governmental advisory committee) such as public notice and open access, comment periods on pending policies, and a public record for decision making.",
    "In addition, the comments identified numerous technical, operational, risk-management, financial, legal compli- ance, and political challenges and noted the difficulty of gaining buy-in to the concept of group acceptance. AHRQ's own analysis of the comments found that ''stakeholders providing comments generally agree that it will be a chal- lenge to provide a framework that encourages participants to conform to community-wide data quality expectations.''",
    "Of most interest perhaps were the philosophical comments, suggesting the depth of skepticism about the notion of health information access and use. Certain commenters viewed stewardship as an inherent risk to the provider/ patient relationship because of what they saw as the tension between the HSR: Health Services Research 45:5, Part II (October 2010) provider/patient relationship and the intrusion of health information via a data steward with large powers into that relationship. Rather than viewing information as strengthening the provider/patient relationship, these com- menters concluded, in AHRQ's words, that health information actually would lead to an ''erosion of patient rights'' including ''unwanted disclosures and research, potential embarrassment, fear in and outside the doctor's office, privacy violations, genetic discrimination, breaches in the confidential patient-doctor relationship, profiling and surveillance,",
    "outside con- trols on the practice of medicine, and health care rationing. This concern extends to the notion that an NHDSE would ''own'' medical data of individuals and lead to the elimination of the citizen's ability to exercise privacy, consent, and ownership rights over medical record information----including genetic information and DNA, placing these rights in the hands of NHDSE directors.13",
    "These commenters focused not on the operational and practical, but instead on the enduring conceptual issue: whether information about health care performance at the provider level should be more accessible. In this regard, the comments reflect the perpetual tension over the role of government and over the extent to which efforts to produce knowledge about health care can be perceived as piercing the relationship between health care professionals and patients in damaging ways.",
    "THE UNDERLYING TENSION: ACCESS TO DATA A data steward assumes the availability of data to be stewarded. In this regard, the environment is clouded.",
    "Concerns reflect those that are familiar to persons steeped in issues of privacy and confidentiality, namely, the capacity of stew- ardship to enable the unmasking of data generated by health care, for use in a broader system context. But the concerns go beyond those embedded in patient rights and reach into the business side of health care, which like any business, depends on the ability of competitors to shield information that may carry business, legal, or social costs.",
    "Without question, government has the power to establish a data steward, and indeed has done so through enactment of a Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research under health reform.13a Indeed, gov- ernment has routinely authorized the collection and use of health information to guide its own practices, relying on its power to tax, to spend, and to regulate commerce (Chemerinsky 2008). Vast amounts of health care data are reported to federal agencies under Medicare and Medicaid and numerous other federal Data Governance and Stewardship health programs authorized under an array of federal laws.",
    "Hospitals' disci- plinary actions against physicians are similarly collected and analyzed. Public health agencies at all levels of government collect, store, and use personal information as part of public health practice (Lee and Gostin 2009). At the same time, certain considerations have prompted government to take a ''go slow'' approach to the task of using its powers to create and amass information that flows from health care and that in turn would enable more rational decisions regarding the allocation of resources or the advancement of population health.",
    "Some of these considerations reflect the ongoing and un- settled nature of privacy and security safeguards, despite advances (Chemerin- sky 2008). Others reflect the professional and powerful business interests inherent in health information, which have the capacity to push back against disclosure despite the enormous federal investment in health care. Indeed, even as government officials have become increasingly focused on the need to know more, the health care industry has succeeded in introducing even greater legal shields to protect their conduct from public view.",
    "Recent exam- ples include the Patient Safety Quality Improvement Act,14 which establishes a federal privilege against the disclosure of ''patient safety work product,'' and the special exemptions from public reporting applicable to Medicare Part D prescription drug plans.15 Health Information Privacy Numerous experts point to the imperfect nature of existing privacy and se- curity standards.16 Amendments to the HIPAA Privacy Rule contained in ARRA are designed to strengthen existing standards by expanding the range of entities subject to the reach of the Privacy Rule, adding security protections, imposing sanctions for failure to notify of breaches, and broadening of pa- tients' rights to withhold consent for certain uses of information.17 The Common Rule18 applies to research, providing added safeguards against unauthorized use of data. In its study, the Institute of Medicine (2009) recommended simplification of data use in research, chief of which were reforms to allow health information custodians to disclose personally iden- tifiable health information without consent to ''prescribed persons or entities'' who have in place ''practices policies and procedures to protect the privacy and confidentiality of personally identifiable health information.",
    "''19 The IOM reports similar practices in the United Kingdom, where the practice of strong data stewardship and advances in data technology20 support such evolution- ary standards.",
    "HSR: Health Services Research 45:5, Part II (October 2010) Other federal and state laws addressing access to and use of certain types of data, such as genetic information21 or information related to mental illness or addiction disorders (Beckerman et al. 2008) pose challenges as well, in their requirements for specific informed consent about data use. How these laws may evolve over time will depend in all likelihood on the safety and security track record that is amassed by data stewards, as well as the extent to which the value of the knowledge gained from better data access is understood in relation to the risks associated with allowing patient and provider data to be amassed and translated into health system evidence.",
    "Data Ownership and Access While privacy considerations slow the march toward data access, issues of ownership----in both a personal and business context----become highly perti- nent as well. There is surprising and wide-ranging uncertainty in the law regarding the ownership of health information contained in medical records, claims forms, and other data repositories spread throughout the far reaches of the health care system. The law regards records holding data as property owned by their creators (with certain access rights granted to patients, insurers, and government agencies as a matter of federal or state law, as is the case with the HIPAA Privacy Rule).22",
    "But the question is whether the data themselves are owned. There are strong arguments that health information cannot be owned, at least not in its original form.",
    "The continuing unsettled nature of the problem can be expected to intensify as paper medical records give way to an electronic highway along which information is free to move. As Professor Mark Hall has observed, ownership of information was never in doubt in an age of paper, because the paper record containing the information was owned by its creator (subject to certain rights of access at common law and under federal and state statutes). However, the electronic information age has ushered in an era in which the content of information can be ''digitized and freed from any particular storage medium,'' (Hall 2009) thereby creating uncertainty as to the right of ownership and control.",
    "Thus, while the Privacy Rule may create a right of access for individual patients or government investigations, it does not settle the far larger question where the future of research is concerned: how to gain access to the vast amounts of information essential to understanding health care quality, safety, efficiency, and health outcomes. Disclosure can create professional, business, and legal liability risks, as evidence of ineffectual health care----or care that falls Data Governance and Stewardship below evidence-based standards----becomes available potentially at an iden- tifiable system practice level. Furthermore, health information can be com- moditized into a lucrative business of its own.",
    "Professor Marc Rodwin has written that ''organizations with medical, prescription, and billing records treat patient data as if those data were their private property'' (Rodwin 2009). As Rodwin notes, the health care industry is able to sell deidentified patient data for billions of dollars, creating an additional business rationale for withholding data from a publicly accountable stewardship entity.",
    "The conflicts between providers and consumers that these divergent interests can create can be seen in Freedom of Information Act litigation brought by consumers to gain access to Medicare physician fee data in order to provide public information regarding regional physician practice and medical costs. Holding that the consumer interest in data access under FOIA is out- weighed by provider interest in privacy under the Federal Privacy Act, a federal appeals court denied data access.23 This of course is not to say that the federal government cannot realign the balance of interests, which it has done in specific situations, such as the public reporting of performance data by Medicare participating hospitals and nursing facilities.",
    "But the rebalancing tends to take place under narrowly circumscribed conditions, ones that are more constrained than the broader data access needs of researchers. A WAY FORWARD Data ownership versus data access suggests two distinct approaches to its resolution. The first, consistent with the concept of health information own- ership (a position also supported by market advocates such as the Heritage Foundation)",
    "(Haislmeier 2009) would be to incentivize data access through payment for information. That is, part of the job of a data stewardship entity would be the purchase of health information considered by experts to be essential to the types of studies envisioned in the realm of patient safety, quality, comparative effectiveness, and population health. With the informa- tion output of health care essentially monetized, the government could ne- gotiate with the industry over the scope and terms of access and use. The strength of this model is its recognition of data ownership rights.",
    "Its chief limitations are cost as well as the uncertainties that surround any market negotiation. The cost is particularly a matter of concern, since taxpayers es-",
    "sentially would be asked to pay twice: once for their support of federal health taxpayer-supported coverage arrangements, and tax benefits programs, HSR: Health Services Research 45:5, Part II (October 2010) flowing to nonprofit health care entities; and then again for access to the information that their expenditures effectively created. An alternative approach is to treat the information output of health care as a public good, available for use by entities structured and operated in accordance with principles of data stewardship. Stewardship entities could be federally chartered, with broad authority to collect, prepare, and support the use of health information in research.",
    "This model would achieve the broad goals set by advocates of evidence-driven care. In many respects it is this model that won the day in health reform, although subject to important limitations on the use of data.",
    "A possible additional step would be to designate certain data uses as being in the public interest and to designate certain data as falling within a required data submission category as a condition of participation in federal health programs. In this context, the term ''federal health programs'' might span Social Security Act programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), health programs of the Public Health Service Act (public health, health resources development and health professions, health research, and other direct pop- ulation health investments).",
    "Congress' Article I Constitutional powers are sufficiently broad so that the reach of such a data submission requirement could encompass not only patient-level data emanating from provision of care directly under federal programs but also data resulting from the provision of care to all payers. Health data governed by submission requirements could be aggregated, managed, and prepared for use by data stewardship entities, which in turn could freely license the data for use by researchers who are able to demonstrate compliance with data stewardship responsibilities. This ap- proach leaves data at the provider level available for subsequent uses, while at the same time assuring a flow of relevant health care data into stewardship entities capable of supporting the type of research enterprise viewed as essential to health system reform.",
    "The comparative effectiveness research provisions in both the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and health reform certainly point in this direction. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act broadly conceives of a new research authority with the power to both accelerate research related to comparative effectiveness and develop the research tools and supports necessary to enable research to flourish.",
    "The Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research envisioned by health reform is po- sitioned to play the type of broad policy making role that in turn can lead to the establishment of data stewardship entities. Working under transparent policy standards and with authority to collect, aggregate, manage, and secure data, Data Governance and Stewardship these entities can enable the research and investigation on which a reformed health system rests, while linking to one another in common purpose to enable advances in population health.",

    "Weeks, Editor-in-Chief Teaching kitchens, as currently designed and im- plemented across the United States and globally, have been designed as learning environments that include a kitchen; however, they are more than culinary instruction sites. Teaching kitchens typically include instruction in most, if not all, of the following: (1) nutrition education, specifically what to eat more of or less of and why; (2) hands-on culi- nary instruction, that is, basic cooking skills for the home cook; (3) information about physical activity and its critical importance in health optimization; (4) mindfulness and its critical relationship to diet, portion control, satiety, and re- silience; (5) the judicious use of web-based resources and information technologies; (6) the relationship between food choices and the environment; and (7) motivational inter- viewing strategies and health coaching techniques whereby personal motivations can be identified and leveraged to successfully achieve sustained behavioral change.1 Emerging teaching kitchen models serve as in-person or virtual life skills learning laboratories intended to promote research centers health and wellness, and as clinical whereby the impact of diet and lifestyle change on a range of behavioral, metabolic, genetic, clinical, and financial variables can be rigorously evaluated. The conceptual origins of teaching kitchens include two philosophical tenets from both ancient China and ancient Greece: 1. Prevention is always superior to intervention.2 In The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine,2 at- tributed to the Legendary Yellow Emperor--who was believed to have lived from 2700 BC to 2600 BC--this tenant is conveyed poetically as follows: ''To admin- ister medicine to diseases which have already devel- oped and thereby suppress bodily chaos, which has already occurred, is comparable to the behavior of those who would begin to dig a well after they had grown thirsty or those who would begin to cast weapons after they have engaged in battle.",
    "Would these actions not be too late. ''2 2.",
    "The way we eat, move, and think impacts our health, and determines our recuperative capacity.2 In addition, both Chinese and Greek medical thought leaders of the 5th century B.C. appreciated that one's ''constitution,'' as referenced by Hippocrates, and one's ''ancestral Qi'' also known as ''vital energy'' in Chinese theory, are also determinants of one's health and resilience. Accordingly, modern teaching kitchens can be viewed as ''learning laboratories'' and ''translational research centers'' where the relationships between food, health, our environ- ment, and the regulation of our genes (and microbiota) can be rigorously studied.",
    "The first ever Teaching Kitchen Research Conference (TKRC) was held in February 2018,3 hosted by the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health (Harvard Chan School) in association with the Teaching Kitchen Collaborative (www .teachingkitchens.org), an invitational network of >30 in- stitutions with teaching kitchens dedicated to the develop- ment of best practices and the creation of a research network whereby teaching kitchens can be systematically evaluated, refined, and scaled for maximum impact (Appendix A1). The second TKRC recently took place November 11- 12, 2020.",
    "Due to generous support from a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH; R13AT010554-01 from Department of Nutrition, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA. EISENBERG the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health) and from unrestricted grants from the Meshewa Farm Foundation and the Campus for Health, LTD ( Japan), the conference had the resources to provide free registration to anyone interested in participating. In addition, this con- ference was formally endorsed by both the Academic Consortium for Integrative Medicine and Health and by the American College of Lifestyle Medicine.",
    "While the 2018 in-person TKRC was held in California and attracted 125 registrants from the United States and a small number of registrants from abroad,3 this second TKRC was held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic and attracted >2500 registrants from 79 countries. More than 900 registrants confirmed the existence of teaching kitchens within their respective institutions.",
    "This highlights how teaching kitchens are becoming more ubiquitous and are being designed and implemented for educational and re- search purposes across the international community. These figures also demonstrate that the desire to share ''best practices,'' novel educational models, and emerging re- search findings within and across teaching kitchens has in- creased considerably since 2018. The 2020 TKRC included presentations from five speakers in addition to 24 oral abstract presentations, 37 poster pre- sentations, and 2 panel discussions.4 The panel discussions focused on (1) methods currently in place to use teaching kitchens to educate health care professionals and (2) re- search challenges and opportunities involving the evalua- tion of teaching kitchens during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "David Eisenberg, director of Culinary Nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and principal investigator of this NIH-sponsored research conference, provided a welcome and overview of the field. He discussed the development of teaching kitchens in the context of the annual educational conference, ''Healthy Kitchens, Healthy Lives'' (www.healthykitchens.org) cosponsored by the Harvard T. H. Chan School and the Culinary Institute of America and offered to health care professionals since 2006; the launch of the Teaching Kitchen Collaborative (www .teachingkitchens.org), an invitational network of organiza- tions with teaching kitchens committed to building best practices and to the evaluation of teaching kitchen inter- ventions with respect to changes in behaviors, clinical out- comes, and costs; and the launch of a new ''Food is Medicine Map'' (https://teachingkitchens.org/map-fim) be- ing built for the purpose of identifying and showcasing teaching kitchen programs, as well as other ''Food Is Medicine'' programs, nationally and globally.",
    "Dr. Eisenberg also described current challenges in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing efforts by Teaching Kitchen Colla- borative members to pivot from in-person instruction to virtual teaching platforms.

After describ- ing the recently published 2020-2030 Strategic Plan for NIH Nutrition Research,5 Dr. Hu provided an overview of the field of precision nutrition, including advances in ge- nomics and other omics technologies.",
    "Dr. Hu proposed that teaching kitchens can be used as (1) precision nutrition re- search laboratories, (2) educational venues for current and future nutrition professionals, (3) natural experimental set- tings to evaluate diet and lifestyle effects across teaching kitchen venues and populations, (4) instructional classrooms to translate research findings into practice, and (5) platforms for promoting sustainability to a global audience. Richard Rothstein, chair of the Department of Medicine at the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine, provided a plenary presentation entitled: ''Teaching Kitchens in Aca- demic Health Systems: Superfluous, Advocated or Essen- tial?''",
    "Professor Rothstein discussed the need for changes in medical education and training with regard to competencies relating to nutrition information and advice. He conveyed that teaching kitchens, functioning as learning laboratories, have demonstrated clinically meaningful outcome improve- ments, that evidence is accumulating for their incorporation into future health care systems, and that future research in this area will not only lead to scientific discovery and define the impact of teaching kitchens, but also provide the nec- essary financial capital to build and sustain such programs in the future. He discussed the role of teaching kitchens in the emerging ''Food is Medicine'' movement, the role teaching kitchens can play in reshaping the food landscape within hospitals and health systems for patients and communities, and mentioned the additional value of teaching kitchens as powerful ''antidotes'' to burnout among health care provid- ers. Teaching kitchens, Dr. Rothstein argued, can improve the quality and reduce the costs of health care.",
    "Nicole Farmer, research scientist at the NIH Clinical Center, presented a plenary entitled, ''Translational Preci- sion Nutrition: Teaching Kitchens and Precision Nutrition of the Future.'' She conveyed that precision nutrition research, across the NIH and elsewhere, should include but not be limited to the study of genomics and omic-related technol- ogies, but rather also include research involving cooking and other relevant self-care behaviors. She added that such research must simultaneously contend with the relevance of social determinants of health on self-care behaviors and outcomes, and should investigate how teaching kitchens can and should be studied in the context of research aimed at reducing health disparities, especially during and after the current COVID-19 pandemic.",

Data are based on a novel series of questions (Cooking Frequency Questionnaire) that was embedded within the Gallup Poll Survey in 2019, to assess the frequency of ''cooking from scratch,'' and provides information on cooking frequency variability worldwide, gender disparities in cooking fre- quency, and the relationship between cooking frequency and life evaluation and positive experiences. This re- search provides a novel replicable measure of ''cooking from scratch'' and global baseline data regarding cooking frequencies, by country, pre- COVID-19.

The goal of each breakout was to identify (1) topics that are missing from the current list of teaching kitchen research priorities, (2) organi- zations and thought leaders who are currently missing from this multi-disciplinary line of inquiry, and (3) collaborations that do not yet exist but should be explored and nurtured to advance research involving teaching kitchens worldwide.",

Conroy2 Published online: 1 June 2018 (c) Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2018 Over the past decade, there has been an increased focus on the provision of high-quality early care and education programs. This focus is in large part due to the expansion of funding for early care and education programs at the state and federal levels to ensure children and families have greater access and higher quality care and learning experi- ences.",
    "While much of the current focus is on early academic skills, the importance of addressing children's social-emo- tional development has also garnered attention. Shonkoff and Phillips (2000) have identified three critical areas of development for young children: (1) learning to regulate one's own emotions, behaviors, and attention; (2) learning language, reasoning, and problem solving; and (3) learning how to get along with others and form friendships, including resolving conflicts. Although this report was not intended to address social-emotional development specifically, it is important to note the primacy of social-emotional develop- ment in their findings.",
    "There is a significant amount of evidence that young children who have aggressive and anti-social behaviors are likely to continue on a trajectory that includes challeng- ing behavior, school problems, and challenges that affect social opportunities, mental health, and well-being (Bren- nan, Shaw, Dishion, & Wilson, 2012; Dodge et al., 2014; Jones, Greenberg, & Crowley, 2015). There is evidence that this trajectory starts young. Data indicate that social and emotional delays and challenges occur in 10-20% of children between the ages of 2 and 5 (Brauner & Stephens, 2006; Egger & Angold, 2006).",
    "In 2005, Gilliam reported that preschool-aged children were three times more likely to be expelled than children in K-12. More recent data from the Office of Civil Rights confirm these findings and highlight the extent to which children of color are disproportionately * Maureen A.

    "When children are expelled from Pre-K settings, they are removed from the settings in which they are likely to learn the social-emotional skills that will help them be successful in school and life. For these reasons, there is growing national concern about the need to promote young children's social, emotional, and behavioral health. A recent federal policy statement high- lights this concern and offers guidance about decreasing the use of inappropriate discipline practices and promot- ing the use of promotion and prevention practices to foster social-emotional competence (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Department of Education, 2014). The provision of a rich universal social-emotional curriculum is essential for young children and provides a foundation for tiered interventions to ensure that all children receive interventions that result in positive social-emotional outcomes.",
    "While much work has been done on tiered frame- works in K-12, research on these frameworks is more limited in early care and education settings. Although the field of early care and education can ben- efit from knowledge about and lessons learned in K-12 sys- tems of support, there are a number of factors related to young children that should be considered in the design and delivery of tiered supports in early childhood settings.",
    "First, preschool-aged children are in the early stages of learning social-emotional competencies. They are learning to express their emotions, get along with their friends, work together, and solve social problems. Given their developmental sta- tus, we expect that they will engage in challenging behavior because they often have not learned the skills or competen- cies for engaging in more appropriate behavior. Thus, we expect young children to have problem behavior and our approaches to supporting social-emotional development should be designed with that in mind. Second, the early childhood context is different than the K-12 system in both location and structure.",
    "Young children are served in a variety of settings including public schools, Head Start and a vari- ety of different types of early care and education programs. Vol.:(0123456789)1 3 200 School Mental Health (2018) 10:199-201 These settings vary in terms of type and amount of funding, qualifications of staff, supports for teachers, the length of the school day; but equally important, these contexts differ in the types and amount of supports and interventions avail- able to promote young children's social competence.",
    "These are important considerations when designing supports for young children's social-emotional development. Designing interventions related to supporting young chil- dren's social-emotional development requires not only that we consider effective intervention practices but, that we also consider how to support the implementation of those prac- tices. This is especially important given the range of settings in which young children are served and the qualifications of teachers in those settings.",
    "Professional development has been identified as a key competency driver in implementa- tion science frameworks (Halle, Metz, & Martinez-Beck, 2013). The effectiveness of coaching that includes perfor- mance feedback on supporting teachers' implementation of effective practices has been demonstrated in multiple studies (e.g., Hemmeter et al., 2016; Powell, Diamond, Burchinal, & Koehler, 2010; Snyder et al., 2018; Sutherland et al., 2018). Researchers have demonstrated that when early care and education teachers receive coaching on effective practices, including performance feedback, children receive effective interventions implemented with fidelity, which result in improved social-emotional skills for young children who engage in challenging behavior.",
    "In this volume, we begin to address some of these criti- cal issues. The manuscripts focus on interventions that were designed specifically for supporting young children's social-emotional learning and are being implemented in early childhood settings.",
    "They focus not only on the effec- tiveness of interventions but, also, on the supports that are needed to ensure teachers and other support staff, including coaches, implement the practices with fidelity. In the first article, Hemmeter, Snyder, and Fox (this issue) examine Pyramid Model research with a focus on examining fidelity, professional development and using a fidelity tool to drive professional development and measure outcomes. They describe the use of a professional development model that includes practice-based coaching (Snyder et al., 2015) (i.e., live coaching or coaching delivered using technology) and teachers' fidelity of implementation. The second article also focuses on teachers' fidelity of implementation.",
    "In this study, Sutherland, Conroy, Algina, McLeod, and Wu (this issue) examine two key components of observed treatment integrity (i.e., adherence and competence) and their relation to child outcomes. Next, Downer and his colleagues (this issue) explore the use of data-based decision making and video-based feedback to assist teachers' selection and imple- mentation of behavioral strategies as well as their self-effi- cacy and child outcomes. Seeley and colleagues (this issue) examine the effects of the First Step to Success Intervention on young children with comorbid externalizing and internal- izing behavior problems, including children with elevated anxiety symptoms.",
    "Finally, Bierman, Mathias, and Dom- itrovich (this issue) synthesize the outcomes of the studies presented in this special issue and highlight commonalities, unique contributions, and promising new directions. Given the number of young children with social, emo- tional, and behavioral difficulties served in early childhood settings and the availability of research-based intervention programs that can be implemented by teachers with fidelity, we hope this special issue will help the field focus on the application of targeted interventions with fidelity during the early childhood years.",

    "In 2012, food insecurity affected 14.5% of the households in the U.S and 20% in the state of Georgia. Individuals who are food-insecure can experience malnutrition, and social and physical problems. The purpose of this study was to assess food access and security concerns in two counties of the North Central Health District 5-2 (NCHD 5-2) in Georgia and to aid in devising interventions to increase food access and reduce food insecurity. Methods: Data collection involved surveying 399 public housing residents within two NCHD 5-2 counties using the Household Food Security Survey developed by the US Department of Agriculture.",
    "The survey contained 24 questions focusing on demographics and household food status and on the severity and prevalence of food access and security. Results: Of the 399 participants, 91.9% reported annual household incomes less than $30,000; 61% (n = 244) reported receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP/food stamps) benefits, 11% (n = 46) received Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) benefits, and 3.3% (n = 13) received Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). Results for food security status (whether or not families have access to food at all times) showed that 7.3% (n = 29) were classified as high food secure, 22.8% (n = 91) as marginally food secure, 30.6% (n = 122) as low food secure, and 39.3% (n = 157) as very low food secure.",
    "Conclusions: Most of the residents with some form of food insecurity received government food assistance, yet still identified as being unable to feed themselves or their families for the month. Recommendations to evaluate this problem include additional research and implementation of public health efforts to address food access and insecurity through policy changes and implementation of programs. Keywords: food access, food insecurity, public housing residents, food policies INTRODUCTION Since 1995, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has provided annual food security reports for each state. The reports are based on the USDA's Household Food Security Survey (HFSS), an 18-item survey used to classify households as either food secure, marginally food secure, low food secure, or very low food secure.",
    "Food-secure households have access by all members at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life (Coleman-Jensen, Nord, & Singh, 2013). Marginally food secure households have evidence of food insecurity among household members and concerns about adequate food supply and management (Podolsky, 2010). The food intake of low food secure households is occasionally reduced, and members have experienced hunger at some point. Very low food secure households repeatedly suffer from severe reductions in food intake and hunger (Bickel, Nord, Price, Hamilton, & Cook, 2000).",
    "In 2012, the USDA reported that 14.5% of the households in the United States were food insecure (i.e., less than food secure) throughout the year, an increase of nearly 100% from the 7.5% reported in 1995 (Coleman-Jensen, Nord, & low food security and Singh, 2013). Georgia currently ranks sixth in the nation for households having tenth for households with very low food security, at 16.9% and 6.9%, respectively, both of which are higher than the national averages (Food Research Action Center, 2013; Coleman- Jensen, Nord, & Singh, 2013).",
    "Poverty is often cited as the foundation of food insecurity (Haering & Syed, 2009). Food security is largely dependent on individuals' socioeconomic status (SES) such as wealth, income, education, and housing conditions (Bickel et al., 2000). Therefore, the poor and unemployed are those most likely to have limited access to food and to fall into one of the food insecurity categories.",
    "Public housing residents often share some of these SES characteristics (i.e., poor, often unemployed, less educated), as do individuals who qualify for benefits from Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Women, Infant, and Children (WIC) program. For instance, criteria for residency in public housing often include a specific annual gross income according to household size, qualification as a senior citizen/disabled, and current US citizenship or eligible immigration status. Criteria for SNAP and WIC benefits are also income-based, with the applicant's income falling J Ga Public Health Assoc (2015) Vol. 5, No",

The increase in food insecurity warrants attention because food insecurity can undermine healthy or optimal development, and lead to malnutrition and social and physical problems. Focusing attention to food insecurity primarily at the national and state levels may obscure relevant sub-trends.",
    "Further, county-level data and data from specific populations, particularly underserved populations, are lacking. The objective of this study was to assess food access and security concerns among public housing residents within Georgia's North Central Health District 5-2 (NCHD 5-2), in specifically Houston and Bibb Counties, implementation of interventions.

    "DISCUSSION CONCLUSIONS The findings show that food access and security are a major concern among public housing residents of Bibb and Houston Counties. Of the surveyed residents, 69.9% were identified with some form of food insecurity. Most residents who reported receiving government food assistance were still identified as being unable to feed themselves and/or their families for the entire month, leaving them to go without food and/or rely on low-cost, and perhaps low- quality food for the remainder of the month.",
    "For instance, 72% of participants who received SNAP benefits were still considered food insecure. The recent decrease in SNAP benefits (Bolen, 2015) may have contributed to the inability of governmental assistance recipients to provide adequate their families.",
    "amounts of food for Additionally, the income requirements for government food assistance lead some to reason that federal food and nutrition assistance programs may overlook many people who should be considered eligible (Cook, 2002). Individuals who are food insecure can experience food deprivation, malnutrition, famine, and social and physical problems. themselves and The fundamental cause of food insecurity and hunger in the United States is poverty, marked by a lack of resources to address basic needs such as food, shelter and health care (Haering & Syed, 2009).",
    "Nevertheless, according to the present findings, federal and state programs intended to help the poor meet their basic needs are, in many instances, falling short. Poverty is a dominant contributor to food insecurity among the participants.",
    "Limitations The study has several limitations.",
    "Since the participants were recruited via flyers, this was essentially a convenience sample and may not represent the diversity (attitudinally or demographically) inherent in public housing developments. Thus, generalizing findings based on this convenience sample should be made cautiously.",
    "Moreover, the findings are based on self-reports, an oft-noted study limitation, because participants may interpret items and situations differently (e.g., hunger, balanced meal, worry), and different samples may produce different results (i.e., there may be reliability issues). Previous research on food insecurity, however, has also relied on self-reports (Bickel et al., 2000).",
    "Others should assess the topic in a more appropriate manner. Finally, the HFSS does not address the reasons for compromised food consumption (e.g., dieting or fasting) and so may over- or underestimate the degree of to misguided policy food prescriptions.",
    "This limitation presents as an opportunity for further studies to be conducted to identify specific reasons for compromised food consumption among these residents, particularly form of governmental food assistance. Further, the food security scale does not capture all possible dimensions of food insecurity and may those who also receive some lead Hunger among American households due to insufficient resources is a continuing challenge. Implementation of food programs has eliminated many forms of extreme hunger, but less severe forms of food insecurity still exist. The present assessment identified the need to assess gaps within the resources, services, and systems pertaining to food access and food security.",
    "Out of the 399 residents surveyed, 69.9% were categorized as having some form of food insecurity. Although many of the participants are recipients of the government assistance program SNAP, residents still identified as being unable to feed themselves and/or their families for the entire month, leaving them to go without food and/or to rely only on low-cost, and perhaps low- quality, food for the remainder of the month. The results demonstrate that, as food access and security remain a problem at the national and state levels, it also exists at a lower level.",
    "Assessment of this issue on the county level would allow generalization of the results to the entire county for development of interventions at this levels. To be eliminated, food insecurity should be addressed at multiple levels. Implications for Public Health Of surveyed residents, 69.9% were identified with some form of food insecurity. Most residents who receive government food assistance were still identified as being unable to feed themselves and/or their families for the entire month, leaving them to go without food or rely on low-cost, and perhaps low-quality food for the remainder of the month.",
    "Recommendations are that (a) further assessments should be conducted to evaluate this problem and (b) through research and development of effective policies and programs, public health efforts should be implemented within Bibb and Houston Counties to address the issue of food insecurity. Research Implications More research is recommended to determine specific reasons for food insecurity.",
    "For instance, more information on how people make their living and what resources they use to obtain food would establish if the amount of income is the main contributing factor. This can be derived through qualitative research, including conducting focus group discussions and key informant interviews to allow for more subjective responses.",
    "In future assessments of food security in Bibb and Houston Counties, facilitators should conduct research to establish the level of food insecurity, how long it has existed, and the causes. Observations, such as determining availability of grocery store may allow a comparison of qualitative data with previously collected quantitative data. J Ga Public Health Assoc (2015) Vol. 5, No. 2GPHA www.jgpha.com 168Georgia Public Health Association Policy and Program Implications",
    "The present results reveal the need for changes in policies related to food access, particularly those targeted towards people in poverty. Policies and programs implemented to improve community food security should address a range of issues, including participation in and access to federal food assistance programs, economic opportunity and job security, and ecologically sustainable agricultural practices and local food systems (Allen, 1999). Examples include promotion of the federal food assistance programs, community gardens, community-supported agriculture programs, farm-to-school initiatives, and food policy councils (Allen, 1999). At two of its sites, the WRHCHA has established community gardens and orchards (Sharon Rogers, personal communication, February 19, 2014).",
    "Initiatives such as these could be developed at additional public housing sites to aid in the distribution of healthy fruits and vegetables to the residents. The food access and security assessments showed that 73.7 % of the participants who received government assistance were still food insecure. This shows that the food assistance programs do not ensure food security and that there is a need for improvement of these programs, and/or an increase in effective food promotion programs.",
    "One method of meeting that need is through acceptance of SNAP and WIC benefits at farmers' markets. Both farmers' markets in Bibb and Houston Counties accept these benefits indicating that more promotion of the benefits associated with these federal programs would be helpful. Food policy councils can prove to be beneficial in this regard, as this approach allows for representatives food from different groups programs, public housing representatives, and local farmers) to examine the food system and provide recommendations for improvement (Story, Kaphingst, Robinson-O'Brien, & Glanz, 2008).",

    "Introduction: The Healthy Life Project in Moldova works and collaborates with local authorities across all sectors, including civil society organisations, community members and NCD patients to promote integrated, person-centered care. The aim is to ensure vulnerable people, including refugees, have access to health and social care. Overall, Moldova has received nearly 698,000 Ukrainian refugees, of which 96,646 currently remain in the country.",
    "Methods: Through intersectoral capacity building community teams developed local integrated care work plans, including joint assessments of people with NCDs and coordinated individual care across different sectors and community resources. The plans also involved a focus on responding to the needs of Ukrainian refugees. Within this continued implementation support, the project included questions of access to health and social care along the migratory cycle to maintain management of chronic conditions.",
    "Around 97% of refugees are residing in the host community, most of them require particular support in accessing their rights in practice, being women (59%), children (48%) and the elderly (21%). Results: Request for health care services from refugees (28,30%) is one of the forms of assistance expected in addition to cash handouts (76,84%) and in-kind support (35,79%). Therefore, in addition to building capacities for monitoring and management of NCDs, and the application of integrated care, the project considered specific actions for refugees.",
    "Training on managing NCDs within the refugee crisis was provided to Primary Health Care (PHC), hospital, Public Health, and emergency care management teams in 20 districts. To support and ensure mobility of PHC practitioners in responding to increased community needs due to hosted refugees, 835 medical kits were purchased and distributed, alongside protective equipment and disinfectants for both the health and social workers. A guide for community social workers on supporting refugees was developed in partnership with the National Social Assistance Agency and has since been embedded in the curricula of the social assistance faculty within the State Pedagogical University.",
    "During 2022, 20 integrated community care centers have reached 8,464 persons with NCDs, with 77% having their wellbeing jointly assessed by a community nurse and social worker. As a result, most of them were included in preventive measures and supported to manage NCDs (7851 persons). The most vulnerable were identified and assisted, including 15% of NCD patients (675 persons) and supported to gain access to social benefits, while people with complex needs (663 persons) received access to home health and social care.",
    "Considerable progress has been made to promote integrated working locally, between health and social care. As everywhere, collaboration Dnestrean: Adaptability of Integrated Community Care models in Moldova to overcome compounded crisis, including supporting refugees is reliant on personal motivation and local relationship building, and some teams take longer than others. Conclusions: Such community approaches are playing an important role in coordination of efforts to support the most vulnerable, as Moldova continues to face a refugee crisis.",
    "This continuous support to build capacity and ensure implementation of common approaches, facilitated by a jointly held normative framework supports a more integrated approach to service provision at community level, coordinated by local authorities thus making more efficient use of scarce resources",

    "As outlined in the WHO's Framework Conven- tion on Tobacco Control (FCTC), addressing the tobacco epidemic is most effectively done through policy responses such as tobacco taxes, smoke- free public places and bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and spon- sorship.1 2 Although tobacco control policies have been adopted across the globe, effective implementation continues to be a major chal- lenge, particularly in low- income and middle- income countries (LMICs),3-7 where almost 80% of the world's smokers reside and where the majority of tobacco- related deaths are occurring.8 In order to fully realise the public health benefit from FCTC policies, effective implementation is required.",
    "Policy implementation is a critical stage in the policy- making process, preceded by agenda setting, policy formulation and policy adoption.9 It can be broadly defined as the stage that focuses on 'turning policy inten- tions into action',10 including the activities undertaken by groups aimed at achieving the objectives set forth by the adopted policy.11 When a policy is implemented as intended by its designers, the implementation process is considered to have high fidelity, which can in turn positively affect the desired policy outcome.12 Although a number of renowned policy implementation models, frameworks and theories are available,13 14 none of these are sufficiently specific to tobacco control, which is complicated by the strategies and tactics of transnational tobacco companies. In fact, one of the most commonly cited barriers to tobacco control policy implementation around the world is tobacco industry interfer- ence.3-5 Existing models that do touch on the concept of partnership have focused solely on the positive aspect of engaging stakeholders Summary box > Although tobacco control policies have been adopted across the globe, effective implementation continues to be a major challenge, particularly in low- income and middle- income countries, where almost 80% of the world's smokers reside.",
    "> This conceptual framework illustrates the constel- lation of factors that have been shown to influence implementation fidelity: political commitment, insti- tutional capacity and operational effectiveness, so- cial climate and tobacco industry interference.",
    "> Researchers and practitioners can use this frame- work to identify the points of leverage in the im- plementation process and contribute to actionable knowledge as well as theory development.",
    "without taking into account opponents or disruptors.15 Moreover, the applicability of these existing frameworks and theories to LMICs requires further exploration in general, as these countries face unique chal- lenges including a lack of resources, the need for more political support, a lack of sufficient national and local research, and limited state capacity16-18 (defined here as the ability of states to provide public goods).19 A study examining the implementation of health warning labels, for example, found that countries with weaker state capacity were less likely to implement FCTC- compliant health warning labels.18 Public health researchers have urged for a better understanding of the process of effectively translating tobacco control policy into practice, particularly in LMICs, an understanding that encompasses the political and economic dynamics of the process.20",

    "experts at the Johns Hopkins Institute for Global Tobacco Control. Critical factors were identified by triangulating the aforementioned sources.",
    "As illustrated in figure 1, the framework depicts the constellation of factors that influ- ence implementation fidelity and aims to enable coun- tries to improve the implementation of, and compliance with, tobacco control policies. Tobacco control advocates can use this framework to better manage the policy imple- mentation process in their countries, uncover weak areas of implementation, and leverage associated strengths and opportunities.",
    "Interventions can also be devised to target identified gaps. The framework outlines four interacting components and related factors that have been shown to contribute to increased implementation fidelity: the first compo- nent relates to the political commitment from high- level decision makers in the country.",
    "Public policy scholars have long argued that favourable changes in govern- ment, such as turnover of key governmental actors as a result of elections and complementary priorities of the ruling party, can serve as facilitators.13 In the Philippines, for example, elections brought about new leaders who were keen on increasing tax collection efficiency and achieving universal healthcare. This created an opportu- nity for advocates to convince decision makers to change the existing tax structure on tobacco and alcohol prod- ucts in order to generate resources for health, which ultimately enabled the successful enactment and imple- mentation of the Republic Act 10351, otherwise known as the 'Sin Tax'.21 As tobacco control transcends national borders, a country's relationship with the rest of the world, including its trade agreements and foreign policy, BMJGoballHealth:firstpublishedasj./bmgh--onDecember.lDownoadedfromhttps://gh.bmj.comonJanuarybyguest. Allrights,ilncudngifortextanddatiamnng,iAI Hoe C, et al. BMJ Global Health 2019;4:e002078. doi:10.1136/bmjgh-2019-002078 may also influence the level of political commitment for tobacco control. Turkey's desire to gain global visibility, for example, created a political environment that was receptive to global norms and standards, facilitating the adoption of its 100% smoke- free legislation.22",
    "The second component describes the institutional capacity and operational effectiveness of the country, state/ implementation province or municipality. Effective requires networks to be forged across sectors and among key stakeholders. Such networks can provide a critical platform for information exchange and the sharing of resources, knowledge and expertise.23 It also allows organ- isations to find solutions outside their traditional bound- aries and address policy misalignment across sectors.24 In Zambia, for example, misalignment between the health and economic sectors served as a key barrier to the imple- mentation of FCTC. Fostering economic growth through providing investment incentives, including for tobacco production, was central to the country's economic agenda; this is despite the high burden of tobacco use in the country and the FCTC's goal of decreasing tobacco use globally.24 Effective implementation also benefits from a functioning system, the presence of a detailed implemen- tation plan that clearly defines roles, and responsibilities and sufficient investments to ensure adequate resources and workforce.14",
    "This second component is consistent with Articles 5.1 and 5.2 of the FCTC that requires parties to have multisectoral national tobacco control strategies and national coordinating mechanisms. The social climate makes up the third component: this is characterised by norms, practices and beliefs throughout the fabric of society that increases the likelihood of policy compliance. The presence of advocacy groups actively devising strategies to facilitate implementation and increase compliance is also critical.13",
    "These groups tend to be more powerful when linked to a global tobacco control network.25 26 In Colombia, for example, global and domestic actors worked collaboratively to implement the country's tobacco control law. Together, this transna- tional advocacy network ensured implementation fidelity through an array of activities including increasing public awareness, sensitising decision makers and monitoring for non- compliance.26 Finally, the fourth component refers to tobacco industry interference in the country.",
    "Tobacco companies frequently employ an array of tactics including lobbying, political campaign contributions, corporate social responsibility activities and litigation to influence the policy- making process.3-5 Implementation is likely to be even more diffi- cult if these companies are cohesive and able to influ- ence government officials and key decision makers. In India, for example, multinational tobacco companies, local bidi producers and smokeless tobacco companies joined forces to successfully delay the implementation of graphic health warning labels in 2007.27 It is important to note that countries like China and Japan face a unique set of challenges given that the tobacco companies are state- owned and curbing tobacco use can threaten government BMJ Global Health income. The level of a country's adherence to FCTC Article 5.3 (parties protecting policy setting and imple- mentation from commercial and other vested interests of the tobacco industry) can also be influential.",
    "Unfortu- nately, findings from the 2019 Global Tobacco Industry Interference Index showed that adherence to Article 5.3 has been 'far from satisfactory' (p. 5) worldwide.28 As illustrated in figure 1, these four components inter- relate.",
    "Political commitment for policy generation and effective implementation, for example, can influence the number of resources dedicated to the issue,29 thereby enhancing institutional capacity and operational effective- ness. It can also have a direct impact on the population's acceptance of the policy30 and industry interference; and, committed leaders may seek to cultivate an environ- ment that diminishes interference by adhering to FCTC Article 5.3. Likewise, enhanced institutional capacity and operational effectiveness can help foster a receptive social climate and address industry interference through both effective enforcement and public education.",
    "It also has the potential to influence political commitment through the presence of an empowered network of stakeholders and political constituents. A conducive social climate may encourage politicians to be more committed and lessen the amount of resources required to enforce the policy and fuel support to prevent tobacco industry interfer- ence.26 On the other hand, the tobacco industry can also negatively affect the other three components by lobbying politicians, interfering with enforcement efforts and disseminating false evidence to the public.3-5 There are some limitations to this framework.",
    "The relative importance of each of the components needs to be further explored. Likewise, critical questions such as how can we best leverage the different components to achieve implementation fidelity, specifically if certain components are weak also need to be answered.",
    "Despite these limitations, however, this framework draws from multiple sources of evidence and contributes to the field of health policy research in LMICs by identifying, compiling and outlining in a clear and concise manner the critical factors to be considered if the implementa- tion of effective and reliable tobacco control policies in LMICs is to be achieved. We hope that future studies will be undertaken to test and refine this framework and to explore the applicability of this framework to other public health epidemics perpetuated by powerful indus- tries (eg, alcohol and sugar- sweetened beverages).",

    "Besides its own good for individuals, this most likely translates in reduced transmission, but this phenomenon has yet to be fully explored. MethodsandFindings:",
    "In this mathematical modeling study done in the context of Vietnam, we estimated the public health benefit that HCV therapy for injecting drug users (IDUs) may achieve. Treatment coverage of 25, 50 and 75% of chronically HCV-infected IDUs (4 years into infection) is predicted to reduce the chronic HCV viremia prevalence respectively by 21, 37 and 50%, 11 years after full scale up to the intended coverage. At a constant 50% coverage level, earlier treatment, 3, 2, and 1 year into infection is predicted to reduce the chronic HCV viremia prevalence by 46, 60 and 85%. In these later 3 scenarios, for every 100 treatment courses provided, a total of respectively 50, 61 and 94 new infections could be averted. These benefits were projected in the context of current low coverage of methadone maintenance therapy and needles/ syringes exchange programs, and these services expansion showed complementary preventive benefits to HCV therapy.",
    "The program treatment commitment associated with the various scenarios is deemed reasonable. Our model projections are robust under adjustment for uncertainty in the model parameter values.",
    "Conclusions:In this case study in Vietnam, we project that treatment of HCV for injecting drug users will have a preventative herd effect in addition to curing patients in need for therapy, achieving a substantial reduction in HCV transmission and prevalence.

    "$? Current address: The Foundation for AIDS Research, Bangkok, Thailand Introductionis It is estimated that 130-170 million people around the world are chronically infected with the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) [1].",
    "HCV therapy is very effective, with 50-90% (depending on the virus genotype and epidemiological context) of people receiving the currently recommended regimen achieving a Sustained Virological Response (SVR), considered a cure of the infection still prohibitively expensive and [2-4]. HCV treatment considered complex, and like HIV therapy 10 years ago, it is routinely offered in rich settings but almost entirely inaccessible in resource-limited settings. We propose that lessons learned on the HIV front be applied to overcome barriers to accessing HCV therapy in developing countries. One recent observation with HIV is that therapy, besides its own good for patients, is a potent prevention method that markedly reduces transmission [5].",
    "With HCV, early mathematical modeling has now shown that treatment may also reduce transmission and result in HCV prevalence reduction [6,7]. The available data though only derive from western contexts. Here, mathematical modeling was used in a case study in Vietnam to estimate the preventive effect that HCV therapy may have in a developing country context.",
    "This study focuses on the injecting-drug-users (IDU) sub-population, who carries the highest HCV burden. Although we appreciate that caring for IDUs presents particular challenges, we emphasize that evidence supports that compliance with therapy can be adequate in drug users",
    "[8], that similar treatment success rates can be observed in drug users and non-drug users [9], and importantly, that HCV reinfection after successful treatment of IDUs may be low [10-12]. Methods The model The compartmental deterministic model, shown in Figure 1, considers the following groups of individuals: Susceptible (S) individuals who inject drugs but have not yet acquired HCV.",
    "Those who acquire infection are divided into acute asymptomatic (AA) and acute symptomatic cases (AS). Both subgroups may spontaneously clear infection/recover (R), or develop chronic PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org April 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 4 | e34548 Treatment of Hepatitis C as Prevention Figure 1. Model schematic.",

TA and TC represent respectively the acute symptomatic and chronic cases that will receive treatment. Both may either respond to treatment and recover from infection (R), or fail therapy and evolve/remain with chronic infection (C). Finally, cases that spontaneously cleared infection or were cured with treatment may be re-infected and re-enter the acute asymptomatic or symptomatic infection compartments.",
    "The model includes the effect of Methadone Maintenance Therapy (MMT) and Needle-Syringe Exchange (NSE) programs. The IDUs are separated between those who respectively access, and do not access MMT, and movement takes place between the 2 sub-groups. In contrast, the NSE programs effect (nseeffect) are built into the model equations of force of infection. (Table 1)",
    "The intervention of key interest, HCV therapy, is only considered for acute symptomatic cases (TA, who have fair chances to present to or be reached by health services) and patients with chronic disease (TC). Acute asymptomatic cases are not considered for treatment due to the difficulty of reaching this group and the short duration of this state.",
    "Retreatment in those who failed therapy is not an option in this model (assuming a low probability that it would be offered in the programmatic conditions of interest), but it is possible for those re-infected after successful treatment, as they re-enter the pool of susceptible individuals. In a conservative manner, patients on treatment are considered infectious over the duration of therapy given that only a little over half achieve a complete Early Virological Response, i.e. an undetectable viral load by 12 weeks on treatment [13].",
    "Interventions scenarios We studied 3 main intervention scenarios. In scenario A, we introduced HCV therapy at various coverage levels - 25, 50 and 75% - for individuals who have been infected for an average of 4 years (see parameters estimates). In scenario B, treatment coverage is fixed at 50%, but therapy is offered at increasingly early time points into chronic infection (4, 3, 2 and 1 year). It also then includes treatment of individuals with acute symptomatic infection at a 75% coverage level.",
    "Both scenarios are built in the context of current reach of MMT and NSE services, introduced in the model in 2007. In Vietnam, NSE services were introduced and expanded from 2005, and coverage has been roughly stable since 2007",
    "[14]. MMT services appeared later with pilot projects started in 2008/ 9, and they have so far achieved very modest coverage [15].",
    "The scenario C models an HCV therapy program covering 50% of individuals reached 2.5 years into chronic infection, in combina- tion with expanded NSE and MMT services. In all scenarios, HCV therapy is introduced in 2012, but the selected coverage is only achieved after a scale up period of 4 years (see model equations), to mimic programmatic conditions. Likewise, expan- sion of NSE and MMT services in scenario C is modeled with a similar scale up period corresponding to national MMT services expansion plans [16].",
    "Outcomes Conventionally, we first examined the effect of the interventions on the prevalence of hepatitis C infection. Although this logically included the prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies, we were here primarily concerned with the prevalence of true chronic viremic infections.",
    "Importantly, we also report the number of new infections averted per 100 treatment courses provided. For each scenario the model was run with and without treatment and the predicted cumulative number of cases and treatments were recorded. The number of cases averted was defined as the cumulative number of cases predicted from the model run without treatment minus the cumulative number of cases predicted from the model run with treatment.

    "(Fig. 2) No field observation is available to confirm this trend, but it is known that the HIV prevalence in IDUs has started to decline in Vietnam since 2005 and the start of harm reduction interventions [16].",
    "Modelling the introduction and scale up of HCV therapy from 2012 predicts a very noticeable HCV prevalence reduction. The effect on the antibody prevalence appears smaller than that for chronic HCV viremia, as people cured from infection remain antibody positive. Increasing coverage levels predicted incremental benefits, such that by 2027 (11 years after full scale up), the 25, 50 and 75% coverage predict respectively a reduction of chronic HCV viremia prevalence of 21, 37 and 50%. Of importance, we project that at these respective coverage levels, every 100 treatment courses would prevent 37, 45 and 53 new infections, in addition to curing the 65% of patients offered treatment.",
    "This unique quantitative perspective has direct programmatic implications, especially with regard to cost- effectiveness. Treating earlier We further examined the impact of initiating treatment at an earlier point into patients' infection (Fig. 3). At a constant 50% coverage level, earlier treatment had remarkable incremental benefits. From the background 37% chronic viremia prevalence reduction seen if treating patients 4 years into infection (equivalent to scenario A), more proactive patient identification and recruitment into treatment 3, 2 and 1 years after established infection would result in a chronic viremia prevalence reduction of fully scaled respectively 46, 60 and 85% after 11 years of transmitted intervention.",
    "This illustrates the high number of infections that occur in every year of injection sharing. Eventually, the addition of an ambitious approach to identify and treat 75% of acutely infected symptomatic cases offers insignificant additional benefits, which is of no surprise considering the marginal time advantage, and the small proportion that acute symptomatic patients represent in the total case population. Predicted cases averted increase rapidly up to 94 averted infections per 100 treatments if treating patients 1 year into established infection. As an extension, we found that even at low coverage (25%), very early treatment (1 year) has important effects, reducing chronic viremia prevalence by 60% and averting 61 new infections per every 100 treatments (graph not shown).",
    "Combining treatment with expanded harm reduction programs In Scenario C, starting HCV therapy to cover 50% of the IDUs 2.5 years into established disease offers a chronic HCV viremia reduction of 52%. The addition of expanded MMT services brings an additional prevalence reduction of 13% (down by 65%), and finally, expansion of NSE services adds a further 20% effect, bringing the chronic HCV viremia prevalence down to 9% after 11 years of full implementation (a total reduction effect of 85%). However, the addition of expanded MMT and NSE services does not greatly modify the number of infections averted per 100 treatment courses. Program commitment We further projected that for every 1000 IDUs (our total model baseline population), a coverage of 75% of cases 4 years into infection (viremia prevalence reduction of 50%) corresponds to a cumulative number of 723 patients treated after 15 years of implementation.",
    "Intervening early (1 year) with 50% coverage (prevalence reduction of 85%) corresponds in turn to a cumulative treatment caseload of 947 patients after 15 years. On an average yearly basis, these 2 situations correspond respectively to 48 and 63 patients treated per year, for every 1000 IDUs. If extrapolating to the example situation of Hanoi (estimated IDU population in 2008 = 38,000 people [14]) these scenarios would correspond to treating respectively a total of 1824 and 2394 patients per year in the city.",
    "Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analyses showed our model predictions to be qualitatively robust. Effects observed were consistent in scenario A and B (Table 3, effects in scenario A only are presented). The outputs were virtually unaffected by the applied changes to a, m1, m2, nse, q, pCA, pCS and durTC.",
    "A doubling of the intervention scale up duration (tT) only marginally reduced benefits and the applied reduced rate in treatment response (pRC) had also little effect. As the applied lower and upper range of pRC correspond in turn to the SVR that may be expected in programmatic conditions for a subpopulation of patients infected with respectively genotype 1 or genotype 2-3, we project that the preventive effect of treatment may not be greatly modified in a program that would selectively target patients with more favorable genotypes. Importantly, the high estimate rate of reinfection (n), corresponding to 100% re- infection after a little over 5 years, showed also very discrete reduction of the preventive benefits, as our model allowed treatment in case of reinfection.",
    "Outputs were more sensitive to variations in recruitment and exit rates, but a population increase with a higher influx of IDUs (which may more likely be happening in Vietnam according to experts) showed a noticeable increase in the projected prevalence reduction. Interestingly though, the later and new infections averted per 100 treatments changed in opposite direction with variation of hin and hout, as for example, a population increase would ''dilute'' prevalent cases and reduce the relative contribution of treatment on averted infections.",
    "Also, changes in the baseline HCV Ab prevalence influenced the model outputs, showing higher treatment preventive benefits at lower endemic levels, and yet a remaining 34% drop in chronic viremia prevalence in the extreme situation of a 90% baseline Ab prevalence. Finally, a doubling of the estimated time into infection before treatment (scenario A only) showed a noticeable reduction of treatment effect, yet with a persisting reduction of chronic viremia prevalence of 30%.",

    "We show in particular that pro-active efforts to detect and treat patients early into infection offer rapidly increasing prevention benefits, owing to the high number of transmitting events that occur each year of injection sharing. We demonstrated these effects in the context of low coverage with harm reduction interventions (MMT and NSE), as currently observed in Vietnam, and show that expansion of these services would offer additive preventive benefits to an HCV treatment program. Implications Worldwide, 130-170 million individuals are chronically infected with HCV [1].",
    "Effective therapy exists and yet, a minority of patients in need (most live in developing countries) can access therapy. Here, we stress that treatment is not only beneficial for individual patients, and show that it is a plausible prevention method.",
    "At present, harm reduction methods, with other benefits, are considered the only option for controlling the spread of HCV among injecting drug users. Yet, often, they are the object of great controversy, domestically and among certain donors, and their implementation is painfully slow [15].",
    "We argue and have provided new evidence that treatment of hepatitis C as prevention must be appreciated as a potential new tool to control the spread of this disease. We add, in due consideration of the current cost barrier the true cost- effectiveness of this intervention must factor in its preventive effect. We showed in one treatment scenario that for every 100 patients started on treatment (of whom we expect 65% would be cured), 94 new infections could be averted. In gross terms, this to increased treatment access, that would mean that the cost per treatment and per person should be halved, as each treatment would be expected to prevent roughly one additional infection. Strengths and limitations the interventions of Our sensitivity analyses, which included the application of extreme values to some of the parameters, showed our model outputs to be robust, and that the predicted HCV therapy preventive effects could apply in a range of different contexts, including within a wide range of baseline HCV prevalence, despite high reinfection rates, or reduced treatment efficacy.",
    "We have mimicked programmatic realities by building in a gradual scale upof interest, rather than considering their introduction at a given instant as other modeling studies have done. We also projected and discussed the effects ofthe interventions at a perspective of 15 years post initiation and 11 years post full scale up, which may be of greater relevance to policy makers than a longer time horizon which would lead to predictions of greater effects. The following limitations are noted. Although we did not consider very unrealistic targets, such as elimination, we appreciate that some of our scenarios represent ambitious objectives. Many are skeptical of the feasibility of treating HCV-infected IDUs with ongoing substance use, despite published evidence that active IDUs can indeed be treated successfully [8,9].",
    "We recognize that successful programs require particular efforts and multidisciplinary interventions. Such care at a coverage level of 50% may prove very challenging, in particular in resource-limited settings. In turn, innovative interventions at the community level and using peers have helped filling some support gaps that may be unavailable in the institutional health sector",

Finally, we highlight that at low coverage level, although treatment would not greatly reduce prevalence, it would avert a substantial number of infections for every 100 treatment courses offered. Another limitation of our study is that it considered the integration of HCV therapy, MMT and NSE at the population level, rather than at the point of individual care.",
    "That is we do not model the mechanism of an HCV treatment program offering MMT and sufficient clean injecting materials to all treated subjects. However, is known with other the reality of services integration, as it compartments of care such as this of HIV and TB care,is complex. The implementation of MMT and NSE services is again often a sensitive matter, calling upon complex inter-sectorial engagement. As a result, we considered that the integration of HCV therapy, MMT and NSE services would realistically rely on referral between programs, and that complementarity would best be examined at the population level.",
    "As a next limitation, we did not consider the effect that changing prevalence of HIV or Hepatitis B co-infection could have on the risks of HCV acquisition or transmission. While our model was fitted to reproduce the HCV prevalence observed in IDUs at a time of 30% HIV co-infection, it is possible that this level of co-infection will vary over the coming 15 years, with a resulting effect that is not factored into this analysis. Then, although it is discussed that ''susceptible'' IDUs with recent onset on injecting have a different risk of HCV acquisition than more ''experienced'' injectors, we did not distinguish the 2 groups, as their distinct risks have not yet been well quantified [31]. Finally, we left out the risk of sexual transmission of HCV from IDUs, and only appreciate that we ignored a small (uncertain) number of infections averted to other groups.",
    "Acknowledging these limitations, we remain confident that they would not significantly alter the effects described in this study. Evidence from other studies After projecting preventive benefits of HCV therapy in IDUs in the United Kingdom [6], Martin et al. used the optimal control theory to determine what the optimal HCV treatment programme strategy would be under a variety of policy objectives and budget",

At the same time, despite the conducted research, a number of issues regarding increasing the effectiveness of state regulation of social and economic development still need to be resolved.",
    "Each type of economy has its own mechanism for regulating economic processes, or an economic mechanism. Management of a mixed national economy is a mechanism that includes market self-regulation and state centralized management in their organic unity [3].",
    "Regulation is one of the most important functions of the economic management system at all its levels. Regulation is determined by the laws of economic development and is based on the legislative framework, on the relations of enterprises with the budget, on pricing, on the use of incentives and various economic sanctions.",
    "An important difference between the views of J. Keynes and the neoclassicals is that J. Keynes shifted the center of gravity from price and monetary factors to production, finding mechanisms that lead to the imperfection of market self-regulation, which determines the expediency and necessity of state regulation of the economy. A sharp opposition between these theories arose due to the need to achieve a certain optimum during the distribution of GDP through the financial system of the state. As for self-regulation, the market mechanism has certain shortcomings.",
    "One of the main disadvantages is that the market does not contribute to the conservation of non-renewable natural resources; does not have an economic mechanism for environmental protection; does not stimulate the production of goods and services for collective use (roads, communications, transport, etc.); does not ensure the production of socially necessary goods at low prices; prone to unstable development with its inherent aggravation of social tensions in society and the development of inflationary processes. Another disadvantage of such regulation is that the market system can also respond only to those public needs that are revealed through solvent demand. Therefore, the market does not have a mechanism capable of ensuring the satisfaction of national, collective needs [5].",
    "The relationship between state regulation and self-regulation can be expressed in the following formula: \"...state regulation will perform the role of \"the system-forming core of institutionalism, determining its appropriate parameters and modern forms\", since \"far from in all respects, the expansion of the role of the state and entrepreneurial freedoms are irreconcilable opposites. Sometimes state intervention becomes a system of flags that mark the field of economic freedom in its new meaning\" [2]. Regarding state regulation, the Nobel Laureate, American economist V. Leontiev said the following: \"For things to go well, you need wind - it's interest.",
    "The steering wheel is a state regulation. The American economy has a weak steering wheel.",
    "You can't do as Reagan said: raise the sails, let the wind fill them, and go to the cockpit to drink cocktails. This is how he will take us out on the rock, break the yacht into small pieces. The opposite is true in the Soviet Union: the wind does not fill the sails, and then the rudder does not help. I think that the Japanese do it more correctly.",
    "They Issue 1 (17), 2024 Public Administration and Law Review certainly have a private initiative, but the state also plays a big role, influencing the development of the economy in a better direction\" [4]. New forms of \"optimal combination\" of state regulation and self-regulation will contribute to the development of legal regulation of economic activity. O. Vinnyk's opinion is valid: \"Under institutional partnership, self-regulation of public-private partnership relations will be carried out not only with the help of contracts (including the above-mentioned), but also with the charter, internal documents of a joint (with the participation of partners) enterprise [5]. Timeliness of regulation affects trust and the state of legal regulation of economic activity.",
    "In particular, the situation with blockchain, smart contracts, and cryptocurrency in Ukraine can be cited as an example. While the state authorities are coordinating their position on the regulatory and legal regulation of these phenomena, cases of providing services with payment in cryptocurrency have been recorded in Ukraine.",
    "Thanks to the possibility of contractual regulation, freedom of contract (as a more established and long-standing means of self-regulation), conditions are created for the development of new means of self-regulation in economic activity. In this connection, the opinion of O. Bakalinska is valid: \"... self-regulating organizations, interacting in a daily mode with business participants, have all the necessary information about the peculiarities of their work, methods of unfair competition and abuse in market rivalry, have the opportunity to quickly and effectively to solve internal problems of both organizations and its participants, individual moral and ethical problems of professional activity...\" [5].",
    "At the current stage, the model of mixed regulation of the national economy of Ukraine can be outlined in the following aspects: - it should harmoniously combine the anti-totalitarian mechanism of the social market economy and the economic macro-regulation of the mixed economy; - the new economic model should provide for relatively long-term functioning of strong public and private sectors of the economy, and the share of the latter should increase annually. This indicates the need for structural restructuring not only of inter- industry complexes, but also of the country's economy in general.",
    "At the same time, the predominance of the state sector of the economy at the beginning does not imply any benefits, advantages or exclusive rights that enterprises of this sector would enjoy; - in the near future, the economy of Ukraine should only be mixed, one of the criteria for its manageability will be the contradictory unity of relatively strict state regulation of the economy and market self-regulation. At the same time, the weakening and narrowing of the scope of macro-regulation should be carried out only as the mechanisms of market self-regulation in its civilized forms become more effective; - the strengthening of market orientation and market trends in the sphere of the market economy should be carried out simultaneously with the strengthening of the influence of the state in the social sphere. Any attempt to move to market self- regulation in the field of distribution in a country with a post-socialist economy is disastrous; - in the current socio-political situation, the economy of Ukraine should not be separatist, but unitary and constructive with elements of regional self-government",
    "[2]. Issue 1 (17), 2024 Public Administration and Law Review According to the arguments of J. Keynes, there is a direct relationship between investment and economic growth, which is manifested in an increase in the volume of production on a much larger scale than the amount of primary investment invested for it.",
    "This provision is confirmed by practice. For example, the experience of Asian countries has shown that $1 invested in infrastructure projects leads to an increase in GDP by approximately $2-3 [3].",
    "The main conclusion of the theory of J. Keynes was reduced to the fact that the market mechanism does not have automatic stabilizers that are able to maintain the volume of national production at an optimal level and ensure full employment, therefore the state must take responsibility for managing the general level of aggregate costs [4]. Depending on what exactly the problems are and how they are solved with the use of a specific state management mechanism, it can be complex (complex) and include several independent mechanisms. A complex mechanism of state administration may consist of the following types of mechanisms: - economic (mechanisms of state management of banking, monetary and currency, investment, innovation, credit, tax, insurance activities, etc.); - motivational (a set of command-administrative and socio-economic incentives that encourage civil servants to work highly efficiently); - organizational (objects, subjects of state administration, their goals, tasks, functions, management methods and organizational structures, as well as the results of their functioning); - political (mechanisms of formation of economic, social, financial, industrial policy, etc.); - legal (normative and legal support: laws and resolutions of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, decrees of the President, resolutions and orders of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, as well as methodological recommendations and instructions, etc.) [1]. The main means of regulatory influence of the state on the activities of business entities are: -government order; -licensing, patenting and quotas; -certification and standardization; -application of standards and limits; -regulation of prices and tariffs; -provision of investment, tax and other benefits; -provision of subsidies, compensations, targeted innovations and subsidies [4].",
    "To prevent the exploitation of the environment in times of war and armed conflict the General Assembly declared November 6 of each year as the International Day for the Prevention of the Exploitation of the Environment in Time of War and Armed Conflict. When making this decision, she took into account that the damage caused to the environment during armed conflicts leads to the deterioration of ecosystems and natural resources for a long period after the end of conflicts and often affects not only one state and not only the current generation [8].",

    "Our research demonstrates that targeted economic interventions, such as tax reliefs for businesses in critical sectors and increased funding for cultural projects, have a direct correlation with economic resilience. Specifically, regions that implemented these policies witnessed a 15% higher rate of business continuity and a 20% increase in local investments compared to those that did not.",
    "Artistic Revival through State Sponsorship. The establishment of state-sponsored programs aimed at supporting artists and cultural institutions has led to a noteworthy revival of artistic activities. These programs have not only provided financial support but also platforms for artists to engage with national and international audiences, thus keeping the cultural narrative alive and vibrant during tumultuous times.",
    "Environmental Initiatives and Societal Well-being. Introducing green zones and environmental projects in urban and rural areas affected by the war has significantly Issue 1 (17), 2024 Public Administration and Law Review improved community morale and mental health.

    "Technology-Driven Regulation. The adoption of digital tools for monitoring and managing socio-economic activities has enhanced the effectiveness of state regulations.",
    "Real-time data collection and analysis have allowed for agile responses to emerging challenges, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently and effectively. Collaborative Approaches. A key outcome of our study is the successful implementation of collaborative frameworks involving government, private sector, and civil society. These partnerships have been crucial in addressing both immediate needs and long-term developmental goals, fostering a holistic approach to socio-economic and cultural challenges.",
    "Feedback Mechanisms. Establishing robust feedback mechanisms to gauge the success of regulatory measures has proven essential. Continuous feedback has enabled iterative improvements in policies, ensuring they remain relevant and effective under rapidly changing conditions.",
    "These results provide a comprehensive overview of the strategies that have been successful in enhancing the effectiveness of state regulation in Ukraine's socio- economic and artistic realms during the war. They underscore the importance of adaptive policies, community engagement, and the integration of technology and environmental consideration into the regulatory framework.",

The exploration of enhanced economic policies, revitalization of artistic activities through state sponsorship, and the integration of environmental initiatives to boost societal well-being, as discussed in this paper, underscore a comprehensive approach to governance during wartime in Ukraine.",

    "The combined implementation of economic, artistic, and environmental strategies has demonstrated a powerful synergistic effect. Economic policies not only stabilized the economy but also indirectly supported the cultural sector by maintaining consumer spending power which, in turn, benefited artistic sales and patronage.",
    "Similarly, artistic revival initiatives contributed to national morale--a key element in sustaining societal resilience, which is essential for both economic recovery and environmental engagement. Moreover, environmental projects often overlapped with economic and artistic revitalization by providing venues for cultural events and contributing to the aesthetic and ecological rehabilitation of war-torn areas.",
    "These initiatives have helped foster a sense of normalcy and continuity amidst chaos, illustrating how integrated policy approaches can amplify benefits across different sectors. Challenges in Policy Integration. While the outcomes have largely been positive, integrating these diverse strategies under the umbrella of state regulation presents substantial challenges.",
    "The primary challenge is resource allocation. In a war economy, prioritizing expenditures becomes a critical task, and balancing immediate survival Issue 1 (17), 2024 Public Administration and Law Review needs with long-term developmental goals is complex.",
    "Additionally, ensuring that policies are adaptable to rapidly changing circumstances on the ground requires a dynamic regulatory framework and real-time data analytics capabilities. Another significant challenge is maintaining public engagement and trust in government initiatives.",
    "This is particularly crucial in conflict situations where skepticism and fatigue can diminish public participation in state-sponsored programs. Transparent communication and demonstrating quick wins are essential for sustaining public support.",
    "Policy Implications and Recommendations. The findings from this paper suggest several implications for policy-making, especially in nations undergoing conflict: - Holistic Policy Design: Policies should be designed with an understanding of their broader impacts across different sectors. A holistic approach ensures that interventions in one area can support and enhance outcomes in others, thereby maximizing the efficiency of resources used.",
    "- Flexibility and Adaptability: Regulatory frameworks must be capable of adapting to changes with minimal bureaucratic inertia. This might involve decentralizing decision- making processes and increasing the responsiveness of local governance structures.",
    "- Sustainability and Resilience: Long-term sustainability should be a cornerstone of all policy initiatives, particularly in ensuring that economic and environmental policies are resilient to both current and future challenges. - International Cooperation: Leveraging international expertise and funding can enhance the scope and impact of national policies.",
    "This is particularly relevant for environmental projects and cultural exchanges, which can benefit significantly from global partnerships. The integration of economic, artistic, and environmental strategies under state regulation in Ukraine provides valuable lessons on the effectiveness of multi-faceted approaches during crises. As this case study illustrates, the success of such initiatives depends not only on the individual effectiveness of each strategy but also on their capacity to interlink and support one another, forming a robust framework for sustainable national development even in the face of severe adversity.",
    "Conclusions. Given that market self-regulation is insufficiently effective, it can be concluded that state intervention in socio-economic processes is a necessary condition for further development. In other words, the socio-economic progress of Ukraine in market conditions of management, on the basis of sustainable development, will require improvement of the system of state regulation.",
    "The economic policy of the state must fully meet the strategic goals, provided that global development trends are taken into account and modern directions of cooperation between the state, the market and entrepreneurship are improved. As for the global problems of globalization and integration, they require a deep study of further development processes of our state, in dynamics, under the condition of balance between state regulation and the market mechanism in accordance with rapid economic growth.",

    "In this issue, explains the importance of the Indian Court ruling.1 The Indian Court rejected a patent application for a new form of a known compound; their decision will extend benefits of an immensely beneficial drug to many more people.2 Patents, intended to encourage inventions, provide market exclusivity for a certain period of time and thus higher profits for the inventor. However, this also results in limited availability of drugs, diagnostics, and vaccines.",
    "With mono- polies created by patent protection, newly invented products often remain too expensive for people living in low- or middle-resource countries, (in excess of 80 per cent of the world's population).

    "Public sector research institutions - development universities, research hospitals, non-profit research institutes, and Federal laboratories in the US - have, since the start of the biotechnol- ogy revolution - contributed increasingly to 'downstream' or applied research, where products are discovered and patented.

    "A 2011 study of the contributions of public sector research institutions to products approved by the US Food and Drug Adminis- tration (FDA) over 40 years (1970-2009) showed that 143 of 1541 drugs, vaccines, or new indications for drugs emerged from public sector research institutions. Importantly, almost half of 'new drug' applications (46.2 per cent) that FDA treated as 'priority reviews' - meaning they were likely to make important contributions to health - came from these public institutions, contributing 'disproportionately important clinical effects'.7 Targeting specific diseases Initiatives targeting specific diseases, usually 'neglected diseases' have attracted new funding, much of it philanthropic.

The Strategy described a 'system failure' and outlined actions to address needs of developing countries, both for access to medicines and innova- tion to tackle neglected diseases and the needs of neglected populations. The Consultative Expert Working Group (CEWG), created as part of the Strategy and tasked with identifying proposals to strengthen global financing and coordination in health research and development, recom- mended that negotiations commence on a new global framework for R&D - analogous to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (under Section 19 of the WHO Constitution).",
    "Advocates of the framework approach want a binding treaty on 'medical R&D'. (We hope for a term indicating a broader reach than medicine, 'public health R&D'). The treaty would create norms and incentives to speed development of high-priority public health tools, share knowledge widely, and require contributions that factor in ability of countries to share the costs of developing new products. A working group spelled out how to meet those objectives.10,11 In November 2012, WHO convened its member countries to consider the recommendations of the CEWG and begin negotiations on a treaty.",
    "The treaty project immediately provoked predictable pushback from the pharmaceutical industry. Key proposals include: * Long-term national commitments to finance product development.

What the Public Health Community Can Do Many countries are inconsistent - one might say schizophrenic - apparent when one compares global health goals with their trade policies. Even as countries endorse health targets and projects (evidenced by commit- ments to the Millenium Development Goals, contributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and the like) they end up putting the interests of their industries - in this case the pharmaceutical industry - ahead of neglected populations.

    "Public health researchers, health department personnel, and clinicians can explain clearly the needs for health products that already benefit some - but remain unaffordable for others - if not most of those for whom they are well suited.

    "Enquanto a nanociencia corresponde ao estudo dos fenomenos natu- rais que regem o comportamento de atomos, moleculas e estruturas na escala nanometrica, a nanotecnologia consiste na aplicacao da nanociencia para o controle e manipulacao da materia estruturada no nivel atomico e molecular, permitindo o desenvolvimento de dispositivos, materiais funcionais e sistemas com propriedades sig- nificativamente diferentes daquelas observadas na escala micro- ou macroscopica.4 Estudos envolvendo N&N tem sido direcionados para o desenvolvimento de setores como agricultura, energia, preservacao ambiental, saude publica, entre outros.4 *e-mail: adriana.pohlmann@ufrgs.br Inumeros trabalhos cientificos descrevem os beneficios da nano- tecnologia na terapeutica.",
    "A maior parte dos estudos tem sido focada no desenvolvimento de formulacoes nanotecnologicas destinadas ao tratamento do cancer, de doencas inflamatorias, cardiovasculares, neurologicas e ao combate do virus da imunodeficiencia adquirida (AIDS). Na atualidade, existem mais de uma centena de estudos clinicos com nanomedicamentos em andamento, sendo que a doenca-alvo mais recorrente e o cancer de mama, as nanoparticulas mais estudadas sao as de albumina e o farmaco mais estudado e o paclitaxel.5 Contudo a N&N na area da saude apresenta inumeros desafios atuais a serem enfrentados como estudos toxicologicos, pre-clinicos e clinicos, scale-up, regulamentacao e de investimentos privados. Neste contexto, o objetivo desta revisao e analisar o atual panora- ma da N&N no ambito mercadologico e terapeutico, dando destaque aos principais tipos de nanocarreadores utilizados nos produtos nano-",
    "tecnologicos ja comercializados ou em fase de investigacao, obtidos a partir de materiais biocompativeis e biodegradaveis. TIPOS DE NANOCARREADORES BIODEGRADAVEIS O conceito de nanotecnologia vem sendo aprimorado de acordo com os avancos da ciencia, por isso ainda nao ha um conceito in- ternacional consensual para o termo. Na area da saude, a European Medicines Agency define a nanotecnologia como o uso de pequenas estruturas menores de 1.000 nanometros de diametro que sao proje-",
    "tadas para apresentar propriedades especificas. Particularmente nas areas de nanotecnologia farmaceutica e de nanomedicina, os esforcos em pesquisa e desenvolvimento (P&D) visam principalmente projetar nanomedicamentos para oferecerem vantagens em relacao aos seus homologos na forma bulk, principalmente pelo seu tamanho reduzido, ou seja, um aumento na area de superficie em relacao ao seu volume.",
    "Para tanto, diferentes nanoparticulas estao em desenvolvimento, seja para terapeutica ou para diagnostico, sendo que a tendencia mais recentemente e o uso combinado dessas funcoes a partir dos dispositivos \"teranosticos\".6 Os materiais utilizados na obtencao de formulacoes nanotec- nologicas sao selecionados de acordo com suas caracteristicas de biodegradabilidade, biocompatibilidade, capacidade para funciona- lizacao de superficie, conjugacao, complexacao e encapsulamento.7 Os farmacos podem ser encapsulados por diferentes mecanismos, que incluem solubilizacao ou retencao na nanoparticula, conjugacao ou adsorcao.8 Em uma situacao ideal as nanoparticulas, atuando como nanocarreadores, sao capazes de transportar o farmaco para um local de destino especifico (receptor, sitio ativo) para exercer a sua atividade terapeutica com o maximo de seguranca. Os principais nanocarrea- dores engenheirados aplicados na terapeutica sao: os lipossomas, as nanoparticulas lipidicas, as micelas e as nanoparticulas polimericas.7,9 Por sua vez, os nanocristais representam uma estrategia de nanomi- zacao de farmacos pouco soluveis em agua, de forma a aumentar a biodisponibilidade e propiciar vias de administracao injetaveis.10 Lipossomas Lipossomas sao estruturas vesiculares formadas por uma ou mais bicamadas concentricas de lipideos intermediadas por com- partimentos aquosos.",
    "Estes sistemas possuem natureza anfifilica, elevada biocompatibilidade e biodegradabilidade, especialmente quando sao formulados a partir de lipideos naturais. Alem disso, podem ter seu tamanho, composicao lipidica e aquosa,",
    "lamelaridade e propriedades de superficie facilmente modificadas de acordo com requisitos farmaceuticos e farmacologicos.11 Estas caracteristicas tornam os lipossomas sistemas altamente versateis atraindo a atencao dos pesquisadores desde os anos 1970, o que ja resultou na introducao de diversos produtos no mercado. Dentre esses, destaca-se o Doxil(r), que foi um dos primeiros medicamentos com nanotecnologia aprova- do nos Estados Unidos pelo FDA em 1995.",
    "Este nanomedicamento contem o antitumoral doxorrubicina que e passivamente vetorizado ate as celulas tumorais, apos uma diminuicao da captacao pelo sistema mononuclear fagocitario e aumento no seu tempo de meia-vida na circulacao plasmatica.12 Outros nanomedicamentos utilizando este mesmo farmaco como o DaunoXome(r) e o Mycet(r) tambem ja possuem sua aprovacao para comercializacao. Adicionalmente, o Ambisome(r) indicado no tratamento de infeccoes fungicas, por meio da encap- sulacao da anfotericina B, e comercialmente disponivel desde 1997.",
    "Este nanomedicamento possui como vantagem em relacao a formu- lacao convencional, a diminuicao na incidencia de efeitos adversos, possibilitando um aumento da dose administrada.12 Nanoparticulas lipidicas As nanoparticulas lipidicas solidas (NLS) sao formadas por uma dispersao de lipideos com alto ponto de fusao, como, por exemplo, o palmitato de cetila, em meio aquoso. Estudos relatam que uma das vantagens das NLS e o nao requerimento de uso de solventes organicos na sua producao.",
    "Adicionalmente, essas nanoparticulas demonstram grande capacidade de encapsular farmacos hidrofilicos e lipofilicos em sua matriz lipidica.13 A preparacao destes sistemas pode ser realizada por diferentes tecnicas, sendo a homogeneizacao a alta pressao a mais utilizada devido ao seu facil scale-up e curto tempo de processo.13 Apesar de serem utilizadas por diversas vias de administracao, as NLS sao muito empregadas em cosmeticos e medicamentos de uso dermatologico, devido as suas vantagens que incluem: a) excelente biocompatibilidade, pois sao compostas por lipidios com baixa toxicidade e citotoxicidade; b) eficiente delivery transdermico, devido ao pequeno tamanho que garante uma grande area de contato com o estrato corneo, aumentando a quantidade de farmaco que penetra atraves da pele; e c) alta hidratacao da pele, proporcionada devido as propriedades oclusivas deste sistema de-",
    "correntes da sua elevada area especifica. No entanto, as formulacoes de NLS possuem algumas desvan- tagens, entre elas: o alto teor de agua (70 - 99 %), que pode levar a varios problemas de estabilidade dos produtos finais que as contem.",
    "Como alternativa, em algumas aplicacoes topicas, sao utilizados os carreadores lipidicos nanoestruturados (CLN). Estes sistemas tem uma menor temperatura de fusao, pois contem uma adicao de oleos (lipideos liquidos), resultando em um maior teor lipidico (40 - 50 %), que reduz consideravelmente o teor de agua na formulacao.13 Apesar das caracteristicas das nanoparticulas lipidicas, ate o momento nao existem no mercado medicamentos que as contem. Por outro lado, esse tipo de nanocarreador e empregado em cosmeticos e cosme- ceuticos, havendo inumeros produtos nos mercados internacional e nacional.",
    "Micelas Micelas sao estruturas anfifilicas amplamente estudadas como sistemas de liberacao de farmacos para administracao topica, oral e intravenosa.14 A literatura relata diversos tipos de sistemas carreadores baseados em micelas, destacando-se os sistemas micelares mistos, as nanoparticulas micelares e as micelas polimericas. Os sistemas micelares mistos sao formados a partir de misturas de fosfolipideos e tensoativos, geralmente acidos biliares, organizados em torno de um nucleo hidrofobico contendo a substancia lipossoluvel molecu- larmente dispersa. Esses sistemas possuem tamanhos na faixa de 5 a 60 nm apresentando boa estabilidade e biocompatibilidade.15 No mercado farmaceutico, esta tecnologia esta disponivel para o farmaco diazepam com o nome comercial de Valium MM(r)",
    "e como suplemento nutricional de vitamina K1 e complexo multivitaminico, os quais possuem os nomes comerciais de Kanakion MM(r) e Cerenevit(r), respectivamente.16 As nanoparticulas micelares, outro sistema de liberacao baseado em micelas, foram desenvolvidas e patenteadas em 2003 pela empresa Novavax, originando o produto comercial Estrasorb(r) que consiste de uma locao topica para liberacao transdermica do estradiol. Em termos gerais, esses sistemas constituem-se de uma nanoemulsao multifasica formada apos mistura em alta pressao do farmaco, de um solvente, um estabilizante, um oleo e agua. O resultado e uma formulacao com- posta por diferentes micro/nanoestruturas que consistem de cristais de farmaco livre, farmaco associado a gotas de oleo, a micelas ou solubilizado na fase continua.17 Em adicao, as micelas polimericas sao sistemas autoestruturados anfifilicos que possuem tamanho entre 10 a 200 nm.",
    "Caracterizam-se por blocos de copolimeros hidrofilicos e hidrofobicos organizados ao redor de um nucleo contendo um farmaco lipossoluvel encapsulado, o qual pode interagir de forma nao especifica ou estar covalentemente ligado aos dominios hidrofobicos do copolimero. Alem disso, ma- cromoleculas hidrofilicas possuindo carga, como acidos nucleicos, peptideos e proteinas, tambem podem ser encapsuladas no nucleo micelar, por meio de interacoes eletrostaticas com os dominios de carga oposta do polimero, formando os complexos de poliions.14,18",
    "A composicao do bloco hidrofobico e altamente variavel, o que permite a encapsulacao de moleculas com diferentes estruturas, solubilidade e carga ionica, contribuindo para a versatilidade dos sistemas. Por outro lado, o bloco hidrofilico e quase exclusivamente formado por poli(etilenoglicol) (PEG) devido a sua excelente biocompatibilidade e as propriedades furtivas que minimizam interacoes indesejaveis com proteinas sericas e componentes celulares. Os polimeros em bloco mais estudados sao PEG-poli(aminoacidos), PEG-poli(D,L-lactideo) (PEG-PLA), PEG-poli(e-caprolactona) (PEG-PCL) e PEG-poli(oxido Impactos da nanotecnologia na saude: producao de medicamentosVol. 36, No. 10 1522 de propileno)-PEG (PEG-PPO-PEG, Pluronics(r)).",
    "Apesar dos re- sultados promissores obtidos em relacao as micelas polimericas, o mercado ainda nao dispoe comercialmente de produtos baseados nesses materiais, porem ha varios produtos que se encontram em estudos clinicos de fase I, II e III.18 Nanoparticulas polimericas Nanoparticulas polimericas representam uma alternativa tec- nologica com excelente biocompatibilidade, nao imunogenica, nao toxica e biodegradavel.8 Estes sistemas sao transportadores coloidais compostos de polimeros sinteticos ou naturais. Nanoparticulas poli- mericas sao uma classe ampla de nanocarreadores. A mais importante classificacao dessas nanoparticulas consiste em separa-las em dois grandes grupos: os sistemas vesiculares (nanocapsulas) e os matriciais (nanoesferas).8 Diversos polimeros naturais como gelatina, alginato e albumina sao utilizados para preparar as nanoparticulas, no entanto, eles tem desvantagens, como a dificil reprodutibilidade lote a lote.",
    "Por sua vez, os polimeros sinteticos sao poliesteres alifaticos, derivados dos acidos acrilico e metacrilico ou derivados de cianoacrilato de alquila. Os principais exemplos de polimeros pre-formados sao: a poli(e-caprolactona), o PLA, o poli(glicolideo) (PLGA) ou PLA-co- PLGA. Por outro lado, como exemplos de monomeros para polimeri- zacao in situ, destacam-se os derivados de cianoacrilato de alquila.",
    "O farmaco pode encontrar-se dissolvido, retido ou adsorvido na matriz polimerica, ou ainda, no caso de nanocapsulas no nucleo oleoso. As principais tecnicas de preparacao das nanoparticulas po- limericas sao: polimerizacao in situ, polimerizacao interfacial, nanoprecipitacao, deposicao interfacial de polimero, emulsificacao- -difusao, emulsificacao-evaporacao de solvente, salting out, e ainda coacervacao complexa.19 Recentemente, as nanocapsulas de nucleo lipidico, um tipo hibrido de nanoparticula, foram desenvolvidas no Brasil, sendo preparadas por deslocamento de solvente e formadas por auto-organizacao de seus materiais, lipidicos e polimericos.20 Entre os polimeros naturais, a albumina apresenta varias carac- teristicas unicas que a tornam um otimo veiculo para drug delivery, especialmente na area oncologica. Esta proteina e um transportador natural de moleculas hidrofobicas, tais como: vitaminas, hormonios e outros constituintes do plasma.",
    "A ligacao de substancias hidrofo- bicas a albumina e reversivel e permite o transporte de farmacos ate a superficie das celulas. Alem disso, a albumina facilita a transcitose endotelial dos constituintes acoplados a albumina para o espaco extra- vascular.",
    "Um exemplo de produto no mercado e o Abraxane(r) (Abraxis BioScience), que contem paclitaxel.",
    "Nessa formulacao o farmaco encontra-se eficientemente encapsulado em nanoparticulas de albu- mina para a utilizacao no tratamento do cancer de mama, de celulas nao pequenas do pulmao e de ovario. Anteriormente, ja se encontrava disponivel o medicamento Taxol(r) (Bristol-Myers Squibb), que utiliza o Cremophor EL(r), como adjuvante na formulacao. Entretanto, esse adjuvante pode causar severa alergia, hipersensibilidade e ate mesmo choque anafilatico. Desta forma, ha necessidade da pre-utilizacao de esteroides e anti-histaminicos para a prevencao destes efeitos adversos.",
    "Alem disso, outra vantagem do Abraxane(r) e o seu inicio de acao mais rapido (30 minutos) em relacao ao Taxol (3 horas), aliada a vetorizacao do farmaco ate o tecido tumoral, devido ao carreador.21 Nanocristais Novos medicamentos tem sido desenvolvidos utilizando nanocris- tais de farmacos, principalmente por meio da tecnologia NanoCrystal(r)",
    "(Elan Corporation, Ireland). Estudos relatam um aumento na solu- bilidade de farmacos pouco soluveis e a possibilidade de utilizacao em formulacoes pelas vias oral e parenteral.",
    "Os nanocristais sao produzidos por uma tecnica de moagem sob alta energia, utilizando poli(estireno) altamente ramificado, e estabilizados por tensoativo. Esta tecnica permite a reducao das particulas para um tamanho inferior a 1.000 nm e, ainda, um aumento na area especifica de superficie do farmaco.",
    "Por isto, esta tecnologia tem sido utilizada principalmente para um aumento significativo na biodisponibilidade oral de farmacos, reduzindo o tempo para atingir a concentracao plasmatica maxima. Uma vantagem em relacao as nanoparticulas polimericas e a nao utilizacao de matrizes polimericas.10 O comprimido com o imunossupressor sirolimus (Rapamune(r), Wyeth Pharmaceuticals) foi o primeiro produto comercial disponivel no mercado, aprovado em 2000. Alguns outros medicamentos foram re-desenvolvidos empregando a tecnologia NanoCrystal(r) para uma maior biodisponibilidade e uma menor variacao das concentracoes plasmaticas do farmaco, quando o paciente esta em jejum ou ali- mentado, como o fenofibrato (Tricor(r), Abbott), verapamil (Verelan(r), Alkermes Pharma)",

    "A Critical Analysis of the Heat Action Plan in Ahmedabad, India Maryam Nastar Lund University Center for Sustainability Studies (LUCSUS), Lund University, Box 170, SE-221 00 Lund, Sweden; maryam.nastar@lucsus.lu.se Received: 12 October 2020; Accepted: 29 October 2020;",
    "Published: 31 October 2020 Abstract: To protect public health, heat-related policies are increasingly being adopted by city authorities to address the unequal impact of heatwaves. Ahmedabad's Heat Action Plan (HAP) is an acclaimed and successful policy response in India and beyond. While the pilot evaluation of the initiative suggests that almost a thousand deaths were avoided annually after its implementation, it is not yet clear whose lives were saved, and to what extent this statistic was due to the HAP, rather than other factors.",
    "By reviewing the published and grey literature centering on the HAP target groups, outreach strategies, and impacts on urban services, this paper points out major knowledge gaps concerning the potentials and impacts of the HAP, which may lead to the systematical exclusion of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups from the intended benefits. In this paper, it is argued that the effectiveness and inclusiveness of the HAP predominantly depend on its integration into urban development projects, which is a challenging task given the existing horizontal and vertical fragmentation in the planning of city projects. Moreover, urban plans and policies, including the HAP, are shown to be overly focused on technology, and as a consequence, they do not realize their limited scope in addressing the associated issues, which are fundamentally social, deep, and structural, such as spatial inequality in Indian cities.",
    "Keywords: heatwaves; inequality; urban heat vulnerability; Heat Action Plan; urban policy; India 1. Introduction Extreme heat accounts for more weather-related deaths per year than all other forms of extreme weather combined [1].",
    "While the most severe effects are projected for urban areas, they are not evenly distributed [2]. For example, in Indian cities, which are faced with rising inequality and warmer C on average), the health risks are higher for more than one hundred million people summers (35 living in the slums, as compared to the middle- and upper-class urban dwellers [3]. *",
    "To protect public health, heat-related policies are increasingly being adopted around the world by city authorities to address the unequal impact of heatwaves. For example, more than thirty cities in India have adopted a Heat Action Plan (HAP), wherein particular attention has been paid to vulnerable and disadvantaged groups.",
    "The adaption strategies highlight the importance of defining temperature thresholds, which are based on a city's historical climate and geography data, and designing early warning systems and planning for emergency conditions, especially concerning vulnerable and disadvantaged groups [4-6]. Additionally, a city's HAP often includes cool roof initiatives and increasing vegetation cover within cities to mitigate heat effects in residential neighborhoods (ibid).",
    "Despite the above endeavors, the data and analyses concerning the relevance and impacts of heat-related policies are significantly limited. Thus, this paper aims to contribute to a better understanding of the criteria on the basis of which policy initiatives are evaluated and to examine their actual impacts on the target groups. Furthermore, it aims to move beyond describing the limitations of Urban Sci. 2020, 4, 53; doi:10.3390/urbansci4040053 www.mdpi.com/journal/urbansci (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:1)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7) Urban Sci. 2020, 4, 53 2 of 16 policy responses and provide a critical analysis of the drivers of urban heat vulnerability in order to outline pathways towards more inclusive and effective heat action plans.",
    "To achieve these aims, the paper draws on the case of Ahmedabad's HAP, which represents a critical case, which has strategic importance regarding the general problem [7].",
    "Ahmedabad's HAP is considered to be a critical case because of its increasing popularity among policy-makers, considered to be so effective that the governments of India and other South Asian countries have urged heatwave-prone cities to develop similar plans [8]. A pilot evaluation of Ahmedabad's HAP suggests that more than one thousand deaths were avoided annually after its implementation (ibid).",
    "However, the analysis did not indicate whose lives were saved (e.g., were they among the most vulnerable and disadvantaged groups?), nor to what extent this statistic is the result of the HAP, rather than other factors. Addressing these questions becomes crucial, because if the evaluation of the flagship of policy responses reveals that the most vulnerable and disadvantaged groups may not benefit from the HAP as intended, then other cities should adopt a more inclusive strategy to address the unequal impacts of heatwaves.",
    "The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 outlines different understandings of urban heat vulnerability and corresponding responses and provides a critical perspective on the driving forces that make some social groups more vulnerable than the others in times of heatwaves. Section 3 delineates the methodology and the systematic literature review conducted in the research in order to provide the context of the HAP and analyze its impacts.",
    "Correspondingly, Section 4 demonstrates how urban heat vulnerability and responses are demarcated in the HAP, and Section 5 identifies the knowledge gaps in the HAP evaluation regarding the target groups, outreach strategies, and impacts on urban services. Section 6 discusses some of the barriers to implementing an inclusive and effective HAP in connection to the root causes of urban heat vulnerability, as explained in Section 2.",
    "Finally, in Section 7, the paper provides some suggestions for future research and potential entry points to addressing urban heat vulnerability. 2. Urban Heat Vulnerability: Different Understandings and Responses There is robust evidence that in the age of climate change, heatwaves will become more frequent, intense, and prolonged [9].",
    "This not only increases the likelihood of heat-related illnesses, but also increases the stress on water resources, energy systems (e.g., electrical systems), animals, and plants [1,9]. While in this paper, the importance of analyzing the impacts of heatwaves on ecological and social systems, as well as their interlinkages, is recognized, it is beyond the scope of this short essay to discuss all of these factors.",
    "By focusing on the effects of heatwaves on human health, this section brings together different understandings of urban heat vulnerability, leading to different framings of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups and policy responses and strategies. By mapping out the health risks in urban areas across different age groups and working conditions, several research studies have demonstrated that the vulnerability to extreme heat varies among different social groups in cities.",
    "For example, older age groups are more susceptible to heatwave effects because of their health conditions or because they live alone and are isolated [5,10]. Children, especially infants, pregnant women, and those with heart or chronic diseases are also more susceptible to the effects of extreme heat [2,11].",
    "Outdoor workers, such as construction workers, street vendors, waste pickers, rickshaw drivers, and traffic police officers are other vulnerable groups in terms of excessive heat exposure [12-15].",
    "Even indoor workers, who work in poorly ventilated buildings or are engaged in the manufacturing or sewing industries, are vulnerable for the same reasons: heat stress, occupational injuries, or decreased labor productivity, which results in economic loss (ibid). Understanding heat vulnerability based on the above health risk assessments has led to a number of policy responses, often based on risk management approaches, wherein the importance of technical definitions of heatwaves (e.g., temperature thresholds), designing early warning systems, and planning for emergency conditions for vulnerable people are highlighted [16].",
    "Urban Sci. 2020, 4, 53 3 of 16 While health risk assessment and consequent policy recommendations are indeed crucial for protecting public health, there has been a growing body of literature drawing attention to the importance of socio-economic factors, leading to different degrees of heat vulnerability [17-19]. Drawing on the environmental justice literature, these analyses highlight how the spatial characteristics of marginalized communities and their limited adaptive capacity make them more prone to the effects of extreme heat (ibid).",
    "These characteristics include, for example, having fewer amenities (e.g., air conditioners or swimming pools) due to the age or price of the buildings [6,18], having fewer trees [20], and having a high percentage of impervious surfaces in the area [19].",
    "These neighborhoods are often dominated by low-income households, and the residents are typically ethnic minorities. Additionally, language barriers [17], limited access to public cooling centers [21], and a lack of property insurance, essential to rebuilding infrastructure",
    "[4], are additional factors that lower marginalized communities' adaptive capacity in addressing the impacts of heatwaves. These research studies call for a better integration of quantitative and qualitative data on heat vulnerability to recognize the disadvantaged groups and to ensure that they are the primary beneficiaries of policy responses. In achieving this, both institutionalized and noninstitutionalized channels (e.g., local protests) of communication with policy makers have been advocated by environmental justice scholars and activists.",
    "While the aforementioned understandings of urban heat vulnerability shed light on the correlations between vulnerable and disadvantaged groups and various health and socio-economic factors, they do not adequately explain why such factors persist [22]. To remedy this, scholars of critical urban theory argue that analyzing and addressing the unequal impacts of climate change, like different degrees of heat vulnerability, requires examining the rules of the game in the governance of cities",
    "[22-28]. This, in turn, calls for analyzing the influence of global economic systems on public policy in cities, as well as a transformation of urban governance and its implications in creating uneven socio-ecological conditions (ibid).",
    "This line of thinking also highlights the processes through which regulatory responsibilities are shifted from the government to local and international institutions, where market-based and voluntary solutions are promoted to address socio-ecological problems (ibid). From this perspective, it is unlikely that environmental justice activism and recognition strategies, in terms of citizen and community empowerment and policy reforms, will address the issue of vulnerability, because they are often too focused on the local issue and do not challenge the forces of the marketization and commodification of resources and services",
    "[22,24,26]. Constructing new forms of urban solidarism, between and within cities, under different mottos, e.g., \"cities for people, not for profit\" [27], is seen as a way of uniting different urban struggles in order to draft transnational pledges for just, democratic, and sustainable cities [22,27,28]. 3. Methodology",
    "As Flyvbjerg (2012) argues, in the case study research, the intent of a critical case is to obtain information that permits a logical deduction of the following type: \"If this is not valid for this case, then it is not valid for any (or only few) cases\" [7]. Following this logic, the case of the HAP was selected in Ahmedabad over other cities, because the city is pioneering in terms of implementing innovative policy responses to heat vulnerability. One could argue that if one wished to see a lot of disadvantaged and vulnerable groups that benefited from policy responses to extreme heat in the cities of India and South Asia, one should examine the case of Ahmedabad.",
    "If there is evidence that this might not be the case, then it is likely that other cities that are steadily following the same strategy will face similar challenges, if not worse. Thus, providing and analyzing the data on Ahmedabad's HAP and its acclaimed impacts, can allow us to draw preliminary conclusions regarding its potentials and challenges.",
    "Additionally, analyzing the root causes of these challenges can help us to better understand and address the barriers to effective and inclusive policy responses for vulnerable groups in cities where heatwaves are becoming more intense and inequality is widening. In a sense, this article follows a critical realist view in its case study methodology, according to which researchers look for the causes of known effects by examining the mechanisms and conditions leading to the identified Urban Sci. 2020, 4, 53 4 of 16 outcomes in the case study [29,30].",
    "In accordance with this view, the concepts or causal patterns under investigation are \"relevant for understanding phenomena elsewhere (including by way of contrast)\" [29], p. 315 (for detailed description of the critical realist philosophy of science and its application to case studies See [29,30]).",
    "In collecting and analyzing the data in a critical case study research, a common first step is to conduct a literature review to synthesize the current knowledge and provide insights for further investigation [7,31]. The first stage in this process is to refine the research questions [31], which are: (1) How is heat vulnerability understood in Ahmedabad's HAP, and what strategies are adopted?; (2) What do we know about the HAP acclaimed outcomes, and what are the knowledge gaps?; and (3) What factors are linked with the success or failure of the HAP?",
    "The next stage in the process of the systematic literature review is to describe the inclusion criteria. As argued by Petticrew and Roberts",
    "[31], the choice of literature is not an inherent feature of the systematic review method, but rather a decision made by the researcher that is guided by the research questions and the theoretical stands [31].",
    "Considering the research questions above, the article draws on insights from environmental justice and critical urban theory (see Section 2) to (1) provide the context of Ahmedabad's HAP, (2) assess the acclaimed outcomes and ascertain the knowledge gaps, and (3) determine the underlying factors leading to the current outcomes in Ahmedabad, as explained below. In providing the context of the HAP, the academic articles' abstracts, titles, and keywords were searched using the algorithm of TITLE-ABS-KEY (Ahmedabad AND Heat) AND (Action OR Plan OR Policy) in the Scopus database. The initial search returned 29 sources.",
    "After reviewing the abstracts and browsing the articles manually, only 9 were found to be relevant to heat vulnerability and policy responses in Ahmedabad, having a direct and indirect reference to the HAP. By reviewing these articles, a series of policy responses to and reports on natural disasters in urban settings were identified. The key actor groups drafting these documents included the Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, National Disaster Management Authority, Amdavad Municipal Corporation, and Natural Resources Defense Council, a U.S.-based non-profit international environmental advocacy group, which has worked closely with the municipality in drafting the HAP. In collecting data regarding the HAP impacts, all the articles and reports identified in the previous stage were thoroughly reviewed.",
    "Additionally, press releases and reports by governmental and non-governmental organizations, locally and internationally, were examined through a Google News search and by using the keywords \"Ahmedabad\" and \"Heat Action Plan\" in combination with the keyword \"Vulnerable\" OR \"Vulnerability\" between 2013 (when the HAP was initiated) and 2020. The initial result returned 51 sources. After reviewing these sources manually, it became evident that the articles by Hess et al.",
    "[8], Knowlton et al. [14], and Azhar et al. [32], with overlapping authorship, are the main data sources, based on which the appraisals of the HAP were made.",
    "In analyzing the acclaimed impacts of the HAP on vulnerable groups, especially slum dwellers (as framed in the HAP), the paper sought to examine how these groups are identified and how their access to urban services, particularly to water and green spaces, has changed because of the HAP. These elements were selected for further investigation based on the environmental justice theoretical stands, wherein the notion of heat vulnerability is asserted to be linked with socio-economic factors, such as access to city amenities.",
    "Thus, in the first step, the data on the slum population from the Census of India were retrieved and compared to other data sources, including interviews with governmental officials stated in the local media, newspaper articles, and data collected by academics and local non-governmental organizations through fieldwork. In the next step, the data on access to water and green spaces were collected from the sources identified in the previous stages, and the search was extended by using new keywords concerning access to water and green spaces between 2013 and 2020. Following this, the algorithms of TITLE-ABS-KEY (\"Ahmedabad\" AND \"Water\"), ABS (\"Management OR Plan OR Access\" OR \"Development\"), TITLE-ABS-KEY (Green OR Tree), and TITLE-ABS-KEY (\"Ahmedabad\") ABS (\"Management OR Plan OR Access OR Development\") were used.",
    "The search results returned 38 and 25 sources for access to water and green spaces, respectively. Urban Sci. 2020, 4, 53 5 of 16 Sorted by relevance, the abstracts were reviewed, and the sample results were further limited to include the articles providing information on the infrastructure and quality of accessible water (n = 16) and green spaces (n = 6) in the city. By reviewing these articles and through a snowball sampling, new keywords were identified (e.g., \"Municipal Corporation,\" \"Drinking Water,\" \"Green Cover,\" and \"Green Action Plan\") and searched in Google, in combination with \"Heat Action Plan\" and \"Ahmedabad,\" to identify additional sources. The data collected through the above stages provided a foundation for ascertaining knowledge gaps in the HAP evaluation and acclaimed impacts, as presented in Section 5.",
    "These findings were analyzed using insights from critical urban theory, wherein the effects and implications of policy responses are examined and understood in broader contexts of urban governance and global economic systems, as explained in Section 6. It is worth mentioning that the data collection and analysis offered here constitute the first steps in identifying knowledge gaps and raising a flag in promoting policy initiatives in other contexts, without critically reflecting on the outcomes and limitations.",
    "The next step, which is outside the scope of this article, would be to bridge the knowledge gap by conducting extensive fieldwork in disadvantaged neighborhoods, with a focus on access to urban services during heatwaves. By triangulating these data with the ones collected and analyzed in this study (extracted from academic journals, news articles, governmental and non-governmental reports, and other media outlets), we can gain a better understanding of how city development plans are interlinked with the HAP and how inclusive strategies for addressing heat vulnerability can best be practiced.",
    "4. Heat Vulnerability in the Heat Action Plan (HAP) 4.1. Ahmedabad's HAP Strategies in Addressing Heat Vulnerability Ahmedabad, with a population of about 6.3 million in the urban agglomeration area in 2011",
    "[33], is known for its comprehensive urban development that focuses on smart planning, infrastructure, and resource utilization [34].",
    "Since the city is prone to severe climatic conditions, such as heatwaves, flood, and droughts, preparing disaster management plans has been one of the top priorities of the local government (ibid). The Heat Action Plan (HAP) in Ahmedabad was initiated in 2013 and implemented by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) and partners in response to the devastating May 2010 heatwave, which caused 1344 more deaths than the heatwaves of May 2009 and May 2011 combined [32].",
    "In identifying the groups vulnerable to extreme heat, AMC and its partners conducted a cross-sectional randomized cluster sample survey in 2011 [35,36]. Vulnerability was analyzed in relation to age, work, and health conditions, access to water, sanitation, health care, information, and social connectedness, i.e., social connectivity and reliance on neighbors in times of need (ibid). The results indicated that children, the elderly, slum dwellers with a low income, limited access to resources, and thus a lower coping capacity, as well as outdoor workers are the most vulnerable to heat exposure [35,36].",
    "The main strategy of the HAP is to alert the identified vulnerable groups prior to or during* heatwave periods (i.e., a significant deviation (>5 C) from the normal (or expected) hot weather, which varies by location and duration in India) so that they can take appropriate precautions [37]. In a sense, the HAP is based on early warning systems and community outreach to increase awareness of the risks of heatwaves and how they can be prevented (ibid).",
    "In doing so, as illustrated in Figure 1, AMC disseminates information through media outlets, e.g., by email, text messages, and WhatsApp messages, and by distributing pamphlets and advertisements in the city before a heatwave hits. Urban Sci. 2020, 4, 53 6 of 16 Figure 1.",
    "Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC)'s communication plan, incorporated in the Heat Action Plan (HAP), for issuing heat warnings. Source [37].",
    "As shown in Figure 1, the HAP also initiates an early warning system to alert the relevant agencies to take precautionary measures in their sectors in order to protect public health in times of extreme urban heat. For example, during the hot seasons (i.e., March-July), AMC--along with other agencies--should increase efforts to distribute fresh drinking water and make cooling centers, such as temples, public buildings, and malls accessible to the public [37].",
    "Additionally, they should ensure that night shelters stay open for the migratory population, outdoor workers, slum dwellers, and other vulnerable groups. The HAP also aims to improve the capacity-building among healthcare professionals (e.g., through training workshops) and to promote adaptive measures to reduce ambient temperatures, focused on vulnerable communities, through cool roof strategies [14].",

    "The section presented below identifies the knowledge gaps in the evaluation of the HAP based on a review of the published literature (e.g., books and journal articles) and grey literature (e.g., news articles and reports by governments and NGOs). By identifying the knowledge gaps, this section provides guiding questions for collecting data that are essential for devising and evaluating an effective and inclusive policy response that can ensure that \"no one will be left behind,\" the core principle of the 2030 Agenda.",
    "5. Knowledge Gaps in the Evaluation of the HAP 5.1. Who Is Included in the Statistics, and Who Receives the Warning?",
    "Slum dwellers are among the identified vulnerable groups in the HAP. The data used for estimating the number of this target group were based on Ahmedabad's Slum-Free City plan in 2014, wherein 691 notified slum settlements were listed with a population of 727,934 [37]. This figure constitutes approximately 12% of Ahmedabad's population, which is a significant reduction compared to the figure in 2001 (25%), while the growth rate was reported to be 3.5% in 2011 and 3.2% in 2001",
    "[38-40]. By providing a cautionary tale of progress in Ahmedabad, Bhatkal et al.",
    "[39] argued that the significant decline in the number of slums is largely due to a change in the criteria for identifying slums, and it may not necessarily represent major improvements in housing conditions for many people. Even if we assume that the statistics used by the local government to identify slums are an accurate reflection of reality, we should not assume that everyone living in a slum is necessarily poor.",
    "Slum dwellers are a heterogeneous population, where some people have a reasonable income and the ability to cope with the impacts of heatwaves [39]. Furthermore, in many cities, there are more poor people outside the slums than within them.",
    "In India, Killemsetty [41] and Wang et al. [42] highlighted that the census data on slums do not consider the population of chawls, comprising working-class residential units of very poor conditions. Considering the combined population of chawls and slums, between 20% and 30% of the city's population live in subhuman conditions [41-43].",
    "Moreover, Shah [44] argued that the number could be increased by approximately 10%, if the number of non-notified slum dwellers was also taken into account. The uncertainty concerning the number of people living in poor housing conditions can lead to their exclusion from the benefits of the HAP, since they are not even recognized in the official statistics.",
    "In addition, the effectiveness of the HAP's early warning systems depends on the extent to which the identified risk groups receive the heat alerts in time. This requires a good understanding of the target groups' access to information, e.g., through emails, social media, digital tools, text messages, etc., which all require (digital) literacy and internet or phone connectivity. As argued by Khan, et al.",
    "[45], although there is a high penetration of digital technology in India, literacy and digital literacy are highly contentious issues, complicated by gender and the caste system, resulting in the exclusion of many people. According to the Census of India, Ahmedabad has a literacy rate of 85%, and the figures for access to a computer or laptop with an internet connection or a mobile phone are reported to be 10% and 63%, respectively [33].",
    "Nevertheless, the data on the (digital) literacy rate and access to information (via internet, phone, television, radio, etc.) in low-income settlements are either outdated or missing. For example, a survey conducted in 2002 by an NGO indicated that the literacy rate in slums is around 60% or less [46]. Even an optimistic estimation of the improvement in the literacy rate over the past two decades calls for precaution when assuming that all the vulnerable groups will be informed in time before a heatwave hits.",
    "Thus, it is crucial to identify vulnerable groups and determine their access to information, beyond the definitions and contested figures used in official reports and documents. This requires Urban Sci. 2020, 4, 53 8 of 16 conducting extensive fieldwork in the city, developing a protocol to identify the most vulnerable groups and their access to information, and revisiting the notion of vulnerability in connection with exposure to extreme heat.",
    "Without conducting this research, the effectiveness of the HAP for different social groups cannot be meaningfully evaluated. 5.2. Impacts of the HAP on Access to Services Beyond the identification of vulnerable groups and early warning systems, the HAP intends to improve access to services through other initiatives.",
    "For example, following the HAP, the Green Action Plan was initiated in 2015 to plant thousands of trees not only in order to provide cooling shade, but also to enhance the city's green cover in general [47]. Despite the potential, however, the preliminary data suggest that this initiative has little, if any, impact on city development plans [48]. As of 2016, green spaces accounted for only 3-4% of the total AMC area of 466 km2 [34].",
    "According to a senior AMC official, the number of trees planted in the city declined by 40%, from 109,896 in 2016-2017 to 64,912 in 2017-2018 [49]. Additionally, the number of trees cut in these years increased from 2630 to 3771 in order to widen roads, to expand metro systems, and to develop residential or commercial sites [43,49,50].",
    "In such development projects, when trees are cut, authorities and project managers should plant a similar number of trees somewhere else. However, as argued in the case of converting the four-lane Sarkhej-Gandhinagar Highway into six lanes, planting new trees will not compensate for the ecological damage (e.g, terminating an entire ecosystem of flora and fauna that depends on a 20-year-old tree) or implications for nearby residents, such as heat-trapping via roads, which leads to an increase in temperature by at least a few degrees [51].",
    "The uneven distribution of green spaces across the city also does not appear to have been affected by either the HAP or the Green Action Plan [52,53]. The western parts of the city, occupied by high-income groups in new high-end gated communities, still have more green space than the eastern parts (Figure 2), where industrial and low-income residential areas are located (ibid).",

    "Urban Sci. 2020, 4, 53 9 of 16 Another issue to be addressed by the HAP is that many vulnerable groups do not have access to water, even if they are well-informed in advance to stay hydrated during the day. According to the 2011 Census of India, approximately 75% of households living in the urban areas of the Ahmedabad district had access to water from treated sources [33]. This, however, does not mean that water is always available from these sources.",
    "A survey of the vulnerability to extreme heat within 300 households in Ahmedabad's slums across six zones by Tran et al. [35] revealed that while 86% of the respondents had in-home taps, the availability of water in 93% of the cases was restricted to the mornings. Coping with extreme heat is even more challenging for informal settlers who do not have in-home taps and rely on water from community taps, hotels, gardens, etc.",
    "In a study by Mahadevia et al. [52], the researchers conducted a survey on 860 low-income households across 26 low-income settlements, revealing that around 13% of the respondents, mainly payment dwellers, did not have access to piped water.",
    "In addressing this issue, the HAP advises the AMC to ensure staff presence during heatwave periods to distribute fresh drinking water across the city and to communicate with various sectors, advising them to suspend all non-essential uses of water [37]. Additionally, it suggests that the Labor Department provides water at work sites during heatwave days (ibid). Despite these recommendations, the AMC's endeavors to set up water facilities in association with shop owners and volunteer organizations have not effectively addressed the issue [55].",
    "A field observation of more than 50 locations in April 2019, in which free water facilities were expected to be located, revealed that many citizens could not obtain drinking water for free or at an affordable cost (ibid). The Rs 20 water bottles were reported to be expensive for most people, while Rs 5 and Rs 10 water bottles were not available in the facilities (ibid).",
    "In another field study conducted on 16 traffic police officers, Raval et al. [13] pointed out that not all traffic junctions are equipped with shaded break areas and/or water canteens designated for workers.",
    "As noted by the authors, while the research participants had seen advertisements on prevention strategies, mainly in newspapers, they had seldom heard about the HAP [13].",
    "While the HAP is indeed a pioneering initiative, with the existing knowledge gap regarding the impacts on vulnerable groups in terms of improving their access to water and green spaces, it might be too early to celebrate the success of its implantation. As the environmental justice literature on heat vulnerability suggests, a better integration of quantitative and qualitative data on vulnerable groups and their limited adaptive capacity is required to evaluate the impacts of the HAP and to improve it.",
    "Beyond this recognition, it is argued in this paper that the scope of national guidelines [56], on the basis of which Ahmedabad's HAP is devised, should go beyond adaptive measures, such as voluntary-based water provision. Additionally, the current mitigating and long-term measures, i.e., increasing green areas and constructing green buildings and cool roof initiatives, have proven to be difficult or unaffordable for implementation in low-income areas",
    "[52,53]. Moreover, the long-term measures in the national guidelines do not include any component related to dealing with the housing situations of low-income groups with limited access to water and electricity [56]. In the case of Ahmedabad, as the preliminary findings suggest, if the HAP aims to improve the coping strategies of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups, it should be linked to city development plans, e.g., upgrading existing low-income settlements and managing water resources and service delivery [48,52].",
    "The reasons why these factors have not yet been realized are discussed below. 6.",
    "Discussion: Barriers to Implementing an Inclusive and Effective HAP 6.1. Institutional Challenges An integrative approach to addressing the impacts of heatwaves, as employed in the HAP, requires coordination between various agencies and institutions in different sectors and at different levels of government (i.e., federal, state, and city). This, however, has proven to be a difficult task to accomplish.",
    "The fragmented planning and overlapping roles within and between water, energy, health, waste, and other sectors, as well as agencies at different governmental levels, have often been cited Urban Sci. 2020, 4, 53 10 of 16 as institutional barriers to implementing effective and inclusive climate adaptation and mitigation plans [48,57,58]. In the water sector, for example, Shah [59] argued that the lack of coordination between surface water and groundwater organizations has been an obstacle to integrative approaches to water management.",
    "Because of this, many cities miss the opportunity to adequately manage their water resources through rainwater harvesting, storm-water management, and groundwater recharging [59]. As a result, cities continue to import water from distant sources, despite the mounting evidence of negative social and ecological outcomes of inter-basin water transfers [60].",
    "In the city governance settings, there are also multiple issues associated with coordinated and integrated planning in relation to the provision of housing and services [57,58], which directly affect adaptation and mitigation strategies, such as the HAP.",
    "While the provision of services falls under the responsibility of the municipality and other utility organizations, they have limited financial and administrative autonomy in India's federal structure to deliver their tasks. For example, the provision of 12 million affordable houses and 100% sanitation coverage by 2022 is a goal set by the central government, and the state is the key actor in financing the project [58].",
    "As shown in a previous urban renewal mission of the Government of India, the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), 2005-2014, the political dynamics between ruling parties at different governmental levels can lead to a delay of finances for urban local bodies [60]. Additionally, the inadequate organizational capacity in urban local governments remains a major constraint in implementing projects. A lack of time, human resources, and interdisciplinary knowledge and thinking are some of the challenges that still exist, despite the fact that various capacity-building programs and workshops have been organized by the government and international agencies [45,61].",
    "Moreover, a lack of continuous engagement with citizens at various stages of planning has proved to be an impeding factor in the implementation of city projects [45,48]. As shown in several studies, the degree and quality of public participation in the planning and preparation of projects has long been a vague aspect of city development plans (ibid).",
    "With restricted political, administrative, and financial support, cities often tend to formulate climate action plans that are implementable with visible outcomes in the short run [57], a trend that is identifiable in mitigation and adaptation strategies such as the HAP. As a result, climate action plans are often funded by international donors, with measurable deliverables in a short time frame and often with narrow outcomes (ibid).",
    "As argued by Khosla and Bhardwaj [57], the upscaling of city mitigation and adaptation strategies requires engaging with the more politically difficult issues of managing trade-offs and making the decision-making process more democratic. 6.2.",
    "Uneven Urban Development and Implications of Becoming a Smart City As explained above, the effectiveness of the HAP largely depends on its integration into other urban development policies, centering on improving quality of life, especially for vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in the city. In the case of Ahmedabad, there is, in fact, a number of rejuvenation and beautification plans and projects that focus on low-income urban dwellers",
    "[34]. For example, recently, under the Smart Cities Mission (SCM) initiated in 2015, the AMC proposed to redevelop the Wadaj slum, one of the largest slums, with a population of 8000 dwellers, by 2022 [34].",
    "The proposed project includes the rehabilitation of slum dwellers to multi-storied buildings developed at the same location (known as in-situ redevelopment) by utilizing planning interventions (e.g., providing a high Floor Space Index of 3), installing smart features (e.g., smart metering for water and electricity, rainwater harvesting, and solar energy), and creating public-private partnerships (PPP) under various housing schemes (ibid). The provision of green spaces is a mandatory part of the project, seen as a way of promoting a healthy and resilient urban environment and attracting visitors for various recreational purposes.",
    "As mentioned in the proposal, \"in-situ slum redevelopment will organize a growth pattern in a manner that will ensure the quality of life and livability standards, while keeping the slum economically vibrant and environmentally sustainable.\" Urban Sci. 2020, 4, 53 11 of 16 While the outcomes are yet to be seen, there is a body of research arguing that the benefits of smart city projects may have little actual impact on improving the living conditions for low-income dwellers. According to the data of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA), 80% of the SCM's funding will be spent on area-based development, whereas less than 5% of the population in 17% of the cities might actually benefit from the outcomes (on average, only 22% of India's urban population might benefit from SCM's projects, meaning less than 8% of the total population [62]), and in the case of Ahmedabad, this figure is only 1.5% [62].",
    "As for the area coverage, only 0.5% of Ahmedabad's total area of 450 km2 is listed under the SCM's in-situ slum redevelopment project. As argued by Mahadevia [63], \"this is hardly making the whole city smart!\" Furthermore, under the in-situ slum redevelopment projects, the developer is mandated to obtain the consent of 75% of the occupants to start the project [34].",
    "It is, however, not clear how the remaining 25% will be dealt with, which may result in the prolongation of the project or the displacement of the most disadvantaged [64]. The displacement that is occurring in other slum developments of the SCM is even more alarming. By monitoring the forced evictions in 34 of the 100 smart cites, HLRN 2018 [65] revealed that SCM-related projects have resulted in about 17,000 people losing their homes.",
    "Additionally, the poor quality and the location of the houses provided in such rehabilitation and redevelopment projects have left houses unoccupied [65]. In 2017, 30% of 800,000 low-cost houses constructed by the government were lying vacant (ibid). Moreover, relocation to these houses often results in a loss of social networks, jobs (particularly for vendors and maids working in nearby residential areas or business centers), education (e.g., school dropouts), and security, as well as an increase in the commuting time for the affected groups in the name of city development [39,63,65]. In Ahmedabad, for instance, the most acclaimed and awarded project for beautifying and reclaiming Sabarmati River's east bank led to the relocation of 10,000 slum households to the periphery of the city, despite their opposition, with severe impacts on their livelihoods [39].",
    "In a sense, the current city development projects seem like new forms of promoting and implementing neoliberal urban policy [45,66,69]. While under the previous government, this process was pursued under the rhetoric of becoming \"world-class\" or \"global\" cities [60], it is now being framed under the rhetoric of becoming smart cities, with little reflection on the lessons learnt from the past and with no intention of deviating from that direction. In a sense, the development ideas behind becoming smart cities follow the same urban development strategy, seeking the commodification and privatization of public assets and services [22,23,27]. As shown by a large body of research, the focus of such strategies is primarily to attract investments in and professionals to particular areas in the city, which often leads to the destruction of the dignity and social well-being of vulnerable populations and the countries that are to be developed (ibid).",
    "As is evident in India, the SCM follows the same logic of \"entrepreneurial governance\" [23], resting on PPPs with a focus on investment and economic development. The profit-driven strategies embedded in smart city projects seek to offer technological fixes and smart solutions to structural socio-economic problems manifested in the housing and provision of services in cities. However, as shown in JNNURM, these approaches result in a dramatic increase in land and real estate prices, which not only affects low-income dwellers, but also the middle-class in terms of their ability to access formal housing and urban services in metropolitan cities",
    "[60]. The living conditions of a lucky few under the in-situ redevelopment plan may be improved.",
    "However, for the above reasons, smart city projects may indeed adversely affect the adaptation strategies of many with inadequate housing and leave them further behind, which runs directly counter to the core principle of the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development. 7. Concluding Remarks Ahmedabad's Heat Action Plan is undeniably one of the most progressive adaptation and mitigation strategies to protect public health and lives in times of heatwaves in India, which are predicted to be more frequent and intense in the future.",
    "However, the preliminary data collected and analyzed in this article indicate major knowledge gaps when it comes to the assessment of the HAP Urban Sci. 2020, 4, 53 12 of 16 and its impacts. Inadequate and arbitrary data and statistics regarding disadvantaged and vulnerable groups and their access to information, water, and green spaces during the heatwave periods may severely hinder the HAP's potentials and lead to the systematical exclusion of the target groups. To address this, the knowledge gaps identified in Section 5 can be used to create a protocol for collecting data through more qualitative and extensive fieldwork.",
    "Additionally, as discussed in Section 6.1, the effectiveness and inclusiveness of the HAP depend, to a great extent, on its integration into urban development projects, which is a challenging task, given the existing horizontal and vertical fragmentation in the planning of city projects. This calls for radical reforms not only at the organizational level, but also at the broader political and economic levels, at which national urban renewal missions and plans are drafted. Without these, it is unlikely that the HAP will be as effective and inclusive as it is intended to be.",
    "Furthermore, this article argues that the challenges of implementing policy initiatives in a particular field should be understood in a broader context of uneven urban development. Many of the urban projects and initiatives under the Smart Cities Mission are overly focused on technology and thus do not realize their limited scope in addressing the associated issues, which are fundamentally social, deep, and structural, such as spatial inequality in Indian cities. As shown in Section 6.2, such a focus in city development plans has already resulted in widening inequality between the privileged and unprivileged.",
    "While the former can afford to have access to smart buildings and infrastructure, the latter have to struggle with issues linked with resettlement and, in many cases, displacement, which hampers the quality of their access to resources and services. In such circumstances, early warning systems have limited impacts in protecting the health and lives of the unprivileged. The aforementioned arguments lead us to the final remark that addressing the driving factors, which lead to the practical challenges associated with the HAP, requires broadening the political participation of citizens in the discussions on how, for whom, and at what costs cities compete to become \"smarter.\"",
    "Here, active social groups can play a significant role in coordinating collective-claims in decision-making processes concerning, for example, municipal budget allocation and monitoring. This, in turn, requires that these groups, e.g., environmental justice movements, go beyond coordinating efforts that are often too focused on recognition strategies and to adjust their mobilization strategies towards enhancing collective control over city governance practices. Building ties with social movements fighting against market forces and neoliberal urban policies at the national and international levels could be one way, among others, to accomplish this. Only then, in light of uniting urban struggles to draft transnational pledges for equal, democratic, and sustainable cities, we could expect more people to benefit from the integrative climate responses of cities, such as the HAP, in the long run.",

    "The benefits of cooperation for the state and the private partner are determined. A conceptual model of the key factors for achieving success in the development of OPPIs infrastructure based on PPP principles has been developed.",
    "Their role in the activities of OPPIs is indicated. Conclusions.",
    "The model of key factors for achieving success in the modernization of OPPIs infrastructure proposed in the article is a promising direction in the development of medical establishments that provide cardiac care. PPP is a promising direction in the development of the infrastructure of health care institutions in Ukraine. Key words: infrastructure of outpatient polyclinic institutions; cardiac care; infrastructure; public-private partnership. Introduction.",
    "Under modern conditions the factor that initiates the development of infrastructure in health is the interaction and effective cooperation of the domestic entrepreneurial potential with the state. Public-private partnership (PPP) is a form of such cooperation. Currently, one of the priority areas of development of PPP mechanisms over the world is the implementation of economic policy regarding the forced development of innovative entrepreneurship in health care [2].",
    "The word infrastructure translated from Latin means \"the basis of construction\", that is, a set of basic elements of the outpatient polyclinic institutions (OPPI) activity - managerial system, personnel support, financing, the organization of the production process, etc., which together ensure the activity of OPPIs. The main task of the OPPI infrastructure functioning is to ensure the production process. The production infrastructure in the OPPI, in addition to maintaining the normal functioning of the process of production of medical services, also serves to reproduce labor resources in the national economy [3].",
    "Modern realities are such that the effectiveness of the OPPI depends on the modernization of its infrastructure in partnership with private business. Strategic partnership allows to use PPP successfully even in non-profit or low-profit social sectors such as health care and education",
    "[4]. At the moment, the legal and institutional foundations for the implementation of PPP mechanisms in health care have been created in Ukraine",
    "[5, 6, 7]. For the functioning of the production infrastructure, first of all, it is necessary to determine the strategy for the development of OPPI based on PPP principles, taking into account the conditions in which the medical establishment develops, because in any field there are individual success factors. The purpose.",
    "To identify the key factors for achieving success in the development of the infrastructure of outpatient polyclinic institutions (OPPIs) that provide cardiac care, taking into account the conditions of their development based on the principles of public-private partnership (PPP). Materials and methods. The research was conducted according to the program, the basis of which was general scientific methods of analysis, synthesis, generalization, interpretation of scientific data, as well as systemic and structural-functional approaches.",
    "The results Based on the analysis of the infrastructure of OPPIs that provide cardiac care, it was found that the main problems of the organization of cardiac care are underfunding of health care facilities, uneven staffing of doctors and mid-level medical workers, low wages of medical personnel, insufficient equipment of OPPIs with medical equipment, etc. [1, 8].",
    "The data obtained showed that it is necessary to find measures to ensure sufficient financing of the medical institutions under study, the introduction of modern economic mechanisms into their activities. These problems led to the search for joint functioning mechanisms of state and business, since it was the interaction of the state and the private sector that were and continue to be the main economic entities in health care in more than 150 countries of the world",
    "[9, 10]. The relevance of public-private cooperation in the development of the OPPI infrastructure was confirmed by the fact that the PPP has a number of specific features and characteristics. The following can be named among them: * - legal registration of the partnership between the state and participants from the private sector by means of a special agreement, contract.",
    "* Co-financing in certain shares or 100 percent financing by the private sector of PPP projects. *",
    "Predominantly long-term contractual relations, PPP is focused on solving strategic tasks of development of state and communal property and provision of public services. Strategic partnership allows successfully use PPP even in non-profit or low-profit social sectors such as health care and education",
    "[3]. * Distribution of risks in projects between the state and business. *",
    "Innovative methods of managing the sphere of production and providing public services. Within the framework of PPP projects, the private sector brings modern organizational experience, knowledge, and new management technologies to the sphere of production and provision of public services. Also, the main aspects of the PPP mechanism functioning and developing the infrastructure of the OPPI were determined, namely: - organizational and legal aspect; - financial and investment aspect; - technical and organizational aspect.",
    "The organizational and legal aspect as an institutional cover allows to form the infrastructure of the OPPI on the principles of PPP, to ensure its activities in the preparation and conclusion of a contract between public and private partners, to create a favourable environment for innovation. PPPs norms and legal provisions are \"framework\", the basis of the PPP mechanism, on which other elements can already be \"cultivated\" that contribute to normal, uninterrupted work in the implementation of partnership relations.",
    "The regulatory acts reflect procedures for settling discrepancies, measures to control pricing, customer service, operations and market structure. Currently, PPP development in Ukraine is based on - Law of Ukraine \"On Public-Private Partnership\" Bulletin of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine (VPR), 2010, No. 40, Article 524.",
    "With changes made in accordance with Laws of the VPR N 5007-VI (5007-17) dated 21.06.2012, 16.10. .2012 [4]; - Law of Ukraine dated November 24, 2015 No. 817-VIII \"On Amendments to Certain Laws of Ukraine on the Elimination of Regulatory Barriers for the Development of Public-",

    "The financial and investment aspect of the PPP mechanism provides the correct balance of investments, which are carried out in different proportions, but with mandatory private financing and additional state participation in financing and under the condition that services are affordable for consumers. At the same time, the public partner assumes part of the costs for the reconstruction of the object of the agreement, its use and exploitation. Funding sources can be divided into three groups: - Own funds of partners, own capitals; - Loan funds: bank loans, commercial loans, bond loans; loans from foreign and Ukrainian banks. - Involved funds, which include: - sponsorship funds - funds from strategic investors, state and regional funds and development banks; - budget financing (target budget credits (loans), direct subsidies, grants, donations). Technical and organizational aspect.",
    "It includes technical analysis to determine the cost of the service, marketing and sociological research, financial analysis and modeling to determine the cost recovery tariff (balancing of service levels and tariff levels), drawing up business plan options, as well as evaluating the effectiveness of the PPP project. The implementation of PPP mechanisms allows to solve two tasks: first, to reduce the deficit of funding sources, the inflow of investments, and second, to improve the quality of services and the efficiency of health care management. Thus, PPP is a potential tool for developing medical infrastructure, attracting investments, increasing the quality of medical services to the population.",
    "It should be noted that it is beneficial for the state to participate in the PPP, because of the following factors: 1. Expectation of high efficiency of such partnership. The state's decision to use PPP mechanisms in the provision of services is always preceded by analytical work designed to prove that these mechanisms will provide society with great efficiency by achieving of lower costs; higher level of services; risk reduction.",
    "2. New sources of investment. PPP allows the state to gain access to alternative sources of capital, making it possible to implement important and urgent projects that would otherwise be impossible.",
    "3. Reliability of results.",
    "The reliability of obtaining a positive result is ensured due to the financial interest of the private partner in the implementation of the project in order to minimize the level of costs and fix the prices for services before the project's start. This protects the investor and society from the risks of underestimating or overestimating the cost of services. 4. Innovations.",
    "The unique combination of public and private sector capabilities that emerges in PPP and the competitive contracting process determine the high potential of innovative approaches to the creation and management of public infrastructure within the framework of PPP. It is also beneficial for business to participate in PPP because 1.",
    "A private company receives long-term ownership and use, state assets, thus ensuring stable profit in the long term. 2.",
    "When making investments, the entrepreneur receives guarantees of their return, since the state as his partner agrees to ensure a mutually acceptable level of profitability. 3. Possessing economic freedom, a private company can increase the overall profitability of the business during the term of the contract with the state due to increased labor productivity and innovations. Having proved the relevance of private cooperation with the state in the development of OPPIs that provide cardiac care, we developed a model of key factors for achieving success in the development of the infrastructure of medical establishments that work on PPP principles (Fig. 1) marketing goal setting.",

In addition, the study intended to identify the challenges to improving the public hospital pharmacy system and to propose recommendations that could help reform the practice to enhance patient safety and compliance. A cross-sectional study was conducted to understand public hospital pharmacies' organizational structure and determine their practices in Norway and Pakistan.",
    "The results of the research showed differences in 11 main areas of the pharmacy systems of the sampled hospitals. When compared to Norway, the study found that the public hospital pharmacy system in Pakistan could be improved in nine main areas. The results show that hospital pharmacies in Pakistan could benefit from the experience of similar international structures in relation to universal standards and practices. Keywords: Pakistan hospital pharmacy practice; Norwegian hospital pharmacy practice; hospital pharmacists 1.",
    "Introduction For decades, pharmacists have made significant contributions to elevate their pro- fession in hospitals worldwide [1-5]. There has been a long tradition of clinical activities being performed by pharmacists within the hospital setting. A large body of research has discovered a positive impact on patient outcomes [6,7].",
    "For instance, an assessment of pharmacists' clinical involvement from 1989 to 1998 showed a reduced number of deaths with the delivery of different pharmacy services in seven main areas. These areas were drug use evaluation, in-service education, monitoring of ADRs, management of drug protocols, participation in the cardiopulmonary resuscitation team, participation in medical rounds, and completion of admission drug histories [6].",
    "A study on the role of hospital pharmacists showed that their presence in hospital settings had improved the effectiveness of drug therapy in different patients [6]. To capitalize on these successes, hospital pharmacy organizations worldwide are calling on their members to expand their focus from the distribution of medications to patient outcomes [8]. For example, the development of the Basel Statement and the Six Goals promoted in Vision 2015 by the International Pharmaceutical Federation and the Canadian Society of Hospital Pharmacists accentuate the importance of patient outcomes [9]. This new emphasis is consistent with the vision statement by the pharmacy profession in Canada: \"Optimal drug therapy outcomes for Canadians through patient-centered care\"",
    "[10]. In 2009, hospital pharmacy professionals gathered in Basel, Switzerland, to expand on the vision statement of the hospital pharmacy system. The latest changes to patient- centered practice now involve pharmacists giving recommendations to the prescribing physicians as well as offering consultations to patients or their caregivers.

In evidence-based practice, the hospital pharmacist seeks to manage as well as shape the standard and efficacy of every phase of the procedures used in medicating. Professional pharmacy practice follows several important outlines of training as well as education, inter-professional associations, clinical practice, and administrative authority",
    "[11]. A substantial number of researches have investigated hospital pharmacy practice, the competence of pharmacy services, and their staff [12-15].",
    "These studies concentrate on practices in a particular area or a country or on particular pharmacists or hospitals. Practices among pharmacies within hospitals differ from one country to another, even though many regions have the same issues [16]. In many nations, the responsibilities of a hospital pharmacist have evolved, with the latest change being from a drug-oriented service to a patient-oriented one. Both the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) and the European Association of Hospital Pharmacists have published surveys on ongoing practices and guidelines in institutional pharmacy services [5,17]. However, these studies have been limited to hospitals in the United States.",
    "Some researchers have compared the organizational structure of hospital pharmacies in France and Canada [15]. These studies have helped improve the overall quality of healthcare systems.",
    "The Norwegian Ministry of Health and Care Services and the Pakistan Ministry of National Health Services Regulations and Coordination are the leading legislative authority, including pharmaceuticals and hospital pharmacy practice. However, many errors have recently occurred in hospital pharmacies in Pakistan [18-22].",
    "This raises the question of how the organizational structure of hospital pharmacies in Pakistan differs from developed countries, such as Norway, and how these differences can produce considerable variations in the outcomes of pharmaceutical care. When the literature is reviewed, there appears to be a need to examine hospital pharmacy systems of developing countries and compare these with the best practices.",
    "Accordingly, this pilot study surveys the organizational structure of public hospital pharmacy systems in Norway and Pakistan and compares their practices. The research question is: \"What are the differences in the organizational structure and practices of public hospital pharmacies in Norway and Pakistan?\" In order to answer that question, this study has the following sub-objectives: to survey the organizational structure of public hospital pharmacies in Norway and Pakistan; to compare the public hospital pharmacy practices in both countries; to determine the improvements in public hospital pharmacy practice in both countries; and to understand the management challenges faced by the public hospital pharmacists in both countries.",
    "2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Design and Study Location A pilot cross-sectional study was conducted to examine public hospital pharmacies' structure and practices in two disparate countries.",
    "Norway and Pakistan were selected for the study. In the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's ranking of 195 nations' healthcare systems, Norway holds second place [23]. By contrast, Pakistan ranks 154th among 195 countries in terms of quality and accessibility of healthcare. Pakistan is strug- gling to achieve healthcare on par with other developing countries by setting ambitious goals and expectations",
    "[24], but for now, these profound differences in healthcare quality provide a springboard for this study which can be used in Pakistan's efforts to improve its pharmaceutical system. The Norwegian hospitals included in this study are Ulleval hospital (NH1) and Akershus University Hospital (NH2), while NICVD (PH1) and Sindh Government Hospital in Korangi (PH2) are the counterparts from Pakistan.",
    "These public hospitals were not randomly selected. Rather, they were chosen because the researchers have close links to them. All the sampled hospitals are tertiary care hospitals with more than 400 beds. Their public mission, research, and teaching objectives are also similar.",

    "At the time of this study, PH1 had 5 pharmacies and 15 pharmacists, while PH2 had 1 pharmacy and 2 pharmacists. NH1 had 1 pharmacy and 15 pharmacists, while NH2 had 1 pharmacy and 10 pharmacists.",
    "2.2. Data Collection Tool",
    "The structured questionnaire for the research was adapted from guidelines crafted by the ASHP regarding minimum standards for pharmacies in hospitals [25]. The ASHP guidelines on least standards provide the fundamentals for pharmacy services in U.S. hospitals. These recommendations describe a minimum level of facilities and services that a hospital pharmacy must deliver. Some of these recommendations might be appropriate to other healthcare settings or help in assessing the extent and quality of pharmacy services. Several researchers have used these standards to evaluate hospital pharmacy practices in Iran, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, and Spain, respectively [26-29].",
    "The questionnaire used in this study was modified from the original ASPH standards. The nine core elements of care recommended by ASHP were included.",
    "The ASPH guidelines used open-ended questions in subsections (formulary management, samples archiving system, inspection criteria, bar- coding method, and method of sterilization), which we modified to closed-ended questions. Our structured questionnaire eventually comprised 11 sections with 63 \"Yes/No\" ques- tions related to the following: (1) practice management; (2) pharmacy service availability; (3) workspace; (4) medication-use policy development; (5) optimizing medication therapy; (6) drug product procurement and inventory management; (7) preparing, packaging, and labeling medications; (8) medication dispensing and delivery; (9) monitoring medication use; (10) evaluating the effectiveness of the medication-use system; and (11) research. After assembling the questionnaire, we arranged for two pharmacists from each coun- try to review it for clarity.",

Hospital pharmacy is built on practice management standards, medication-use policy, optimizing medication therapy, drug procurement and inventory management, preparing, packaging, and labeling medications, medication dispensing and delivery, monitoring medication use, evaluating the effectiveness of the medication-use system, and research to improve services. These nine features, along with the two additional categories of pharmacy availability and workplace, formed the basis of the survey.",

    "[30]. This study revealed that a written mission statement with goals and scope of services was found in both of the study hospitals in Pakistan as well as Norway.",
    "Practice standards and guidelines in the pharmacy were not found in Pakistan but were in Norway. Practice guide- lines for several disease conditions and healthcare subjects exist in national organizations and specialist boards",
    "[31]. Improving as well as upholding a policy and procedure manual can deliver a well-organized and efficient approach to administering transformation [32].",
    "Hiring a workforce amid reviewing or evolving policies and procedures can build self- esteem and contentment [33]. This study found that policy and procedure manuals were common in all the examined hospitals in Norway, while half those hospitals in Pakistan were found to be deficient. There must be a recognized, organized process for familiarizing new employees with the pharmacy department [34]. Clinical practice guidelines have been shown to improve processes of care, clinical outcomes, and quality medical care",
    "[35]. ASHP surveys conducted in 2007 and 2010 showed that 80% of U.S. hospitals used such policies and procedures regularly to minimize medication errors [14,36]. Yet, this study found no established procedure for orienting new pharmacists in Pakistan, unlike Norway which had well-established procedures in place.",

    "Medication-Use Policy Formulary controlling is key to regulating the quality and cost of pharmaceuticals. Therefore, any drug formulary system must be established on suitable clinical as well as pharmacoeconomic foundations [42,43]. A pharmacy and therapeutic committee operates as a consultative body to the medical workforce and managers in all subjects concerning medicines and supervises the formulary system.

Preparing, Packaging and Labeling Medications Good dispensing practices ensure that medication is delivered to patients with ap- propriate directions in a pack which preserves the potency of the drug up to the time of use [48]. Compounding, then, is akin to the preparation of unlicensed drugs, both sterile and non-sterile, with the intention to fulfill patient-specific needs which are not covered by licensed medications. Compounded drugs are usually prepared extemporaneously in the community as well as in hospital pharmacies for custom orders [49].",

Conclusions and Recommendations This pilot study compared healthcare services and practices in hospital pharmacies in Pakistan and Norway. The evaluation was based on the ASHP guidelines for the systematic assessment of minimum standards in hospital pharmacies. These guidelines are built upon several standards regarding practice management, medication-use policy development, optimizing medication therapy, drug product procurement and inventory management, preparing, packaging, and labeling medications, dispensing and delivery of medications, monitoring medication use, evaluating the effectiveness of the medication-use system, and research to improve the provision of services.",
    "After surveying for all of these standards, it was found that the studied hospital phar- macies in Norway had better utilization of practice management standards than those in Pakistan. This study was the first of its kind to explore differences and similarities between hospitals in Pakistan and Norway.",
    "It found that the quality and degree of services provided by hospital pharmacies in Pakistan was not up to the mark. Therefore, there is a need for states, NGOs, academic institutions, hospitals, and other health-related organizations to understand the importance of hospital pharmacy practices in Pakistan, so as to deliver quality services and ensure patient safety. Furthermore, this study identified opportunities for improving and expanding the services provided by the pharmacy departments in both Pakistan and Norway.",
    "An international collaboration between countries could advance the provision of pharmacy services and ensure that patients receive the care they deserve. Based on the study outcomes, our proposed solutions are labor- and resource-intensive and would require standardization and oversight.",
    "Accurate medication lists across the healthcare continuum are of paramount importance. It is also suggested that pharmacy practice could be improved through cooperation, sharing successes, providing examples of specialized pharmacy services, and encouraging student exchanges. Moreover, the Ministry of National Health Services in Pakistan could improve hospital pharmacy services through the following steps: first, unfreeze the existing situation, which can be achieved by showing that the reasons for change outweigh any arguments against change; second, transition the system to a new equilibrium; and finally, freeze the new system, thereby ensuring that people do not revert to the old ways.",

    "Abstract: Ready-to-eat cereals (RTECs) have become a popular breakfast option claiming to provide important nutrients to children's diets, despite being a source of excess sugar and, therefore, a health concern. Thus, food reformulation constitutes an important public health strategy that could benefit from inputs provided by nutrient profiling.",
    "This study aimed to assess the adequacy of the RTECs for children available in Portuguese supermarkets, applying three nutrient profile models (NPMs)--the nutrient profile model of the World Health Organization's Regional Office for Europe (WHO-EURO), the profile of the private-sector EU Pledge (EU-Pledge), and the national model developed by the Directorate-General of Health (NPM-PT)--in order to explore the potential for reformulation of the RTECs identified as not adequate and evaluate the impact of RTECs' reformulation on the nutritional quality of Portuguese children's diets. In total, 78 RTECs intended for children were assessed and two scenarios--current (not considering reformulation) and alternative (considering reformulation to accomplish the nutrient profile requirements)--were considered to assess the impact of reformulation on nutritional quality. Across all RTECs, only 5.1% could be promoted to children according to the considered NPMs.",
    "The most common nutrients requiring reformulation were sugar, saturated fatty acids (SFA), salt, and dietary fiber. The scenarios of reformulation considered could reduce the RTECs average content of total sugars, SFA, and salt by 43%, 8.7%, and 1.1%, respectively, and dietary fiber intake could be increased by 34%.",
    "Thus, these results support policies to implement reformulation strategies for developing healthier food products to be promoted to children. Keywords: breakfast cereals; nutrient profile; reformulation; food selection; children; health impact Copyright: (c) 2021 by the authors.",

    "The benefits of breakfast, the first meal of the day, as part of a healthy and balanced lifestyle, are widely known from a nutritional, psychological, and societal point of view. The breakfast meal is related to several critical health factors that include healthy body weight, especially among children and adolescents [1].",

According to the same study, the proportion of Portuguese boys and girls who are 11 years old who eat breakfast on school days are 81% and 77%, respectively [2].",
    "Among school children, ready-to-eat cereals (RTECs) seem to be one of the most popular components of the breakfast composition meal (66.5%) [3].",
    "Breakfast cereals include several products grouped into processed cereals such as a porridge-type breakfast, and RTECs or \"cold\" breakfast cereals such as cornflakes and muesli [4]. In our study, we focused on RTECs such as flakes, puffed, and extruded cereals.",
    "Several studies highlight that breakfast cereal consumption may be associated with improved cognitive functioning, with lower measures of overweight or obesity and reduced risk of hypertension [5].",
    "RTECs consumption (compared with low/no consumption) is associated with higher nutrient intakes in the diets of European children and adolescents [6]. The consumption of RTECs has been associated with enhanced intakes of many vitamins and minerals in adults and children, either directly through its consumption or through its co-consumption with milk [7,8].",
    "RTECs are high in carbohydrates and contain dietary fiber, proteins, vitamins, and minerals, which enables the recommended nutritional requirements of some nutrients to be met. Much of this effect is probably due to the fortification of many breakfast cereals [5].",
    "RTECs may also contain high levels of salt and sugar, identified as risk factors for numerous chronic diseases when excessively consumed [9]. Observational and experi- mental studies indicated an association between high intake of added/free sugars and body weight",
    "[10], as well as with an increased risk factor for dental caries [11], and risk of developing several chronic diseases, namely type 2 diabetes [12] and cardiovascular diseases [13].",
    "Initiatives are ongoing across the world to improve food environments and systems and to facilitate healthier children's diets. Aligned with WHO recommendations, national governments across the globe are committed to developing efforts to limit the marketing of unhealthy foods to children",
    "[14,15]. The nutrient profile appears as one of the most relevant strategies to combine per- sonal preference with a food healthy environment. Over the last years, nutrient profile models, which are tools to facilitate healthier food choice, have multiplied, and have been recognized by the industry and governments as a transparent and reproducible way of evaluating the healthfulness of foods. [16,17].",
    "A large number of nutrient profile models have been developed covering different policy applications, highlighting those for regulat- ing nutrition and health claims, marketing of foods for children, front-of-pack labelling (FOPL) systems, and food reformulation [18]. Focusing the restriction of food marketing and advertising to children, the WHO Regional Office for Europe (WHO-EURO) developed a nutrient profile model, and at the European Union (EU) level, several major international companies have signed the so-called EU-Pledge, as a collective self-regulation initiative establishing a code of conduct for marketing activities directed towards children [19,20]. At the national level, and in line with international recommendations, the Directorate - General of Health (DGS), developed a nutrient profile model (NPM-PT), adapting the WHO- EURO and adjusting the limits of some nutrients in certain categories of foods to align with the values defined by European Union legislation.",
    "Changes were also introduced to reflect the commitments established in Portugal regarding the food products' reformulation [21]. The reformulation of food products becomes crucial to reduce the consumption of salt/sodium, sugar, and other nutrients relevant to public health and NP can be used as a tool to improve the overall nutritional quality of diets. On the other hand, reformu- lation should also consider ways to promote the consumption of positive nutrients like dietary fiber.",
    "Foods 2021, 10, 1772 3 of 19 At the national level, the use of NPMs as tools to identify foods that can (or cannot) be marketed to children constitutes an emerging area of research in different countries. The purpose of this study is to add evidence on the validity of the NPM-PT, a NPM developed in Portugal, to correctly identify healthy foods, by comparing it with other models, as well as to test the capacity of the NPM-PT to guide a theoretical reformulation of RTECs marketed to children.",
    "Particularly, the study aimed to answer the following questions: (i) what is the com- pliance rate of the RTECs for children available in the Portuguese supermarket, consider- ing three nutrient profile models designed to restrict food marketing and advertising to children--the NPM-PT, WHO-EURO, and EU-Pledge; (ii) what is the potential for refor- mulation of the RTECs identified as not adequate; and (iii) what is the impact of RTECs reformulation on the nutritional quality of Portuguese children's diets. Data from the present study intend to assist and support the industry companies, nutrition professionals, and policymakers to identify new avenues of research and regulatory actions associated with the implementation of reformulation strategies for developing healthier food products to be promoted to children.",
    "Especially at the European level, considering the European Single Market, there is a movement of goods, including foods. This means that any refor- mulation occurring in Portugal could have a reflection, and consequently, an impact, in other countries.",
    "Additionally, this contributes to promoting the harmonization of foods and nutrition-related policies across countries. At the national level, this research serves as a call for policymakers to consider the NPM-PT as a tool to promote the reformulation of RTECs and other child-targeted foods available in the market. 2.

    "[19], NPM-PT [21], and the most recent version of the EU-Pledge [20].",
    "In the present study, the selected models reflect a category-based approach, supported by criteria for key nutrients. The compliance/non-compliance with the established criteria for the nutrients present per 100 g of food was evaluated, and each food product was classified as suitable/not suitable for promotion for children. These models were selected as they were developed to limit food marketing and publicity to children under 12-16 years, since they have a corresponding European/national scope. Characteristics of the three nutrient profile models used in this study are provided in Table A1.",
    "2.3. Impact of Nutrient Profile Models on the Daily Nutrient Intake RTECs that could be potentially reformulated were identified based on the NPM-PT criteria (presenting the most restrictive profile model), in combination with the dietary fiber criterion from the EU-Pledge, that considers a minimum value of 3 g of dietary fiber per 100 g of product. The dietary fiber criterion was included since the increased intake of fiber has been associated with the improvement of the overall quality of the diet among children and adults",
    "[32]. Furthermore, dietary fiber intake is usually below the dietary reference values, despite any improvement in its consumption, particularly in children, which is expected to be associated with health benefits [22,33].",
    "For the consumption of RTECs by the Portuguese children aged between 3 and 10 years old, data from the Portuguese National Food, Nutrition, and Physical Activity Survey (IAN-AF) conducted from October 2015 to September 2016 were used [22]. Under the IAN-AF, the dietary intake was obtained via two non-consecutive one-day food diaries and with an additional personal interview with parents or other caregivers for more details related to the description and quantification of food [34].",
    "Then, the intake of each food component was calculated and compared with the dietary reference values, established by the EFSA [35] and WHO [36]. Additionally, 20% of the daily energy and nutrient requirements for each age group was assumed as the reference intake for the breakfast meal [37]. Combining the nutrient contents and the consumption of these RTECs, the intake of each food component (total fat, saturated fatty acids, total sugars, salt/sodium, and fiber) was assessed.",
    "Nutrient contents corresponded to the amounts present in the product labels (for those products following the established criteria) or, alternatively, corresponding to the highest (salt, total sugar, total fat, and saturated fatty acids) or the lowest (fiber) amount established in the respective model (for those products that were not in accordance with the established criteria). Current (not considering reformulation) and alternative (considering reformulation to accomplish the nutrient profile requirements) scenarios were compared to assess the attainment of dietary recommended values (DRV) and, consequently, how these values could be impacted by a potential reformulation of RTECs.",
    "Foods 2021, 10, 1772 5 of 19 2.4. Statistical Analysis Once all RTECs information was collected, the reported 78 breakfast cereals were grouped into different categories regarding the ingredients (flavors), type of brand, and presence/absence of the gluten claim and organic labelling.",
    "This information was processed using different statistical methods. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to test the nor- mality of the distribution of the variables to decide between parametric or nonparametric analyses for comparisons. Variables were expressed as the median (interquartile range). The energy (kcal/100 g) and nutrient contents per 100 g of products were compared by the Mann-Whitney non-parametric test for two independent samples (for differences between the gluten and gluten-free categories and conventional and organic labelling categories, respectively) and using the Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test with multiple pairwise comparisons (for differences among cereals categories).",
    "The Bonferroni correction was applied. The level of convergence between the models was evaluated using the Cohen coeffi- cient k. The degree of agreement was scored as follows: 0.00-0.20 \"light\", 0.21-0.40 \"fair\", 0.41-0.60 \"moderate\", 0.61-0.80 \"substantial\", and 0.81-1.00 \"almost perfect\" [38,39].",

    "4. Discussion Breakfast cereals are mentioned by several international surveys as having a high vari- ability in their nutritional composition, in particular concerning sugar and salt content [40].",
    "Simultaneously, robust results showed that consumption of RTECs, especially of fiber-rich or whole-grain RTECs, are implicated with several beneficial nutritional and health out- comes. Nevertheless, high total sugar intakes associated with frequent consumption of RTECs are a cause for concern [4]. Data from the present study do not (intentionally) include whole grains and 'hot' cereals, since this study focused on RTECs with non-whole grain cereals (refined cereal flours), where nutritional quality can be improved through product reformulation.",
    "This research aims to support industrial companies, nutrition professionals, and policymakers to identify actions associated with the implementation of reformulation strategies for the development of healthier food products to be promoted to children. This study was one of the first in Portugal that addressed the nutritional composition and the adequacy of the RTECs for children available in the Portuguese supermarket, ac-",
    "cording to three nutrient profile models designed to restrict food marketing and advertising to children, including the model recently developed for Portugal. Foods 2021, 10, 1772 12 of 19",
    "According to the results obtained in the present study, the levels of total sugar in children's RTECs are considerably higher, and 87% of RTECs did not comply with the sugar criterion (<15 g/100 g). Our findings are consistent with a previous study performed in Por- tugal, showing that 85% of children's RTECs were non-compliant with the sugar criterion and 26% of children's RTECs had more sugar than non-children's (adult's) RTECs",
    "[3]. The results of our study suggest that choosing organic children's RTECs will result in a lower intake of total sugars, highlighted by our data, which are in line with the data from Germer et al.'s study [23].",
    "A study published in 2018 focused on gluten-free products aimed at children and reported that gluten-free products contain lower amounts of sodium, total fat, saturated fatty acids, and sugar content, similar to the values of comparable products with gluten [41]. However, according to the present study, the total sugar content was lower and the total protein level was higher, when comparing gluten-free products with gluten counterparts. Focusing on the type of brand, the higher values for total sugars observed in the in- store brand are in line with the results of the Ikonen et al. study.",
    "These authors concluded that despite being \"tastier\" and consequently presenting a higher consumer demand, these products are nutritionally poorer than other types of cereals [42].",
    "The median fat (3.1 g/100 g) and saturated fatty acids contents observed in our study (1.1 g/100 g) were higher than the results indicated by Tong et al.'s study (1.1 g/100 g and 0.4 g/100 g, respectively) [43].",
    "This discrepancy could be justified by the fact that, in the present study, filled cereals were considered, contrary to the Tong et al.'s study. The sodium content of children's RTECs found was 230 mg/100 g. Similar results were also reported by Tong et al., revealing a median content of 254 mg/100 g in children's cereals [43].",
    "Chepulis et al., in a cross-sectional analysis, described a median sodium content level of 240 mg/100 g in the UK for the children's breakfast cereal with promotional characters [9]. Our data revealed, on average, that children's breakfast cereals contained 4.9 g of fiber per 100 g. About 78% of ready-to-eat cereals are considered a \"source of fiber\" (>=3.0 g), but only 27% of ready-to-eat cereals are considered \"high in fiber\" (>=6.0 g)",
    "[28]. Assuming the child consumption of 30 g of breakfast cereals serving, they would ingest 1.5 g of fiber, which represents on average between 9% to 15% of the adequate intake.",
    "According to EFSA monitoring studies [35], the adequate intake of total fiber varies between 10 and 16 g/day for children between 3 to 10 years old. The consumption of RTECs represents an important source for dietary fiber intake from a single food category",
    "[44]. Fayet-Moore et al. reported that children who consume cereals at breakfast are more likely to meet their recommended intakes of B vitamins (niacin, thiamine, folate), calcium, iron, and fiber",
    "[45]. According to van den Boom et al., the consumption of RTECs is associated with a better nutritional profile in the diet of Spanish children, adolescents, and young adults. The breakfast has better quality in terms of food choices as well as energy and nutrient content [46].",
    "Several studies suggest that children with diets consisting of higher amounts of fiber- rich foods generally consume less energy from total fat and saturated fatty acids and more dietary fiber in children's diets might be associated with a lower risk of childhood obesity [32,47]. Comparing the different nutrient profile models used in the present study, we verified that the WHO-EURO is the most restrictive nutrient profile model followed by the NPM-PT. The EU-Pledge is the most tolerant regarding the restrictions to the marketing of foods for children.",
    "This was already described in different contexts [38,48]. Bonsmann et al.",
    "[48] observed that, from 2691 food products sold in the EU, 48% (EU-Pledge) and 68% (WHO-EURO) do not comply with the EU-Pledge and WHO-EURO nutrient profile criteria, respectively. Maschkowski et al.",
    "[24] also observed a lower com- pliance rate, with only 4-36% of German products meeting the criteria of the different nutrient profiles for cereals marketed to children. Foods 2021, 10, 1772 13 of 19 Labonte et al.'s research revealed great variations in the degree of accuracy and agree- ment between nutrient profile (NP) models with applications in restricting the marketing of low nutritional quality food and beverages for children [49].",
    "Recognizing the obtained results for the compliance of the RTECs available in Portugal with the nutrient profile models, the reformulation of RTECs and the associated impact of this reformulation on health constitutes an important aspect to be properly characterized. The results from the Muth et al. study showed that reformulating a few categories of foods and beverages to reach the levels of products meeting an existing standard could improve dietary intake, particularly for saturated fatty acids, sugars, and fiber [50].",
    "Trying to explore the potential for the reformulation of the RTECs identified as not adequate, the estimated intake of the nutrients considered in the NPM-PT model, as well as fiber, were estimated. Analyzing the results of the simulations with and without reformulation, we observed a reduction of the total sugar intake from 17 g/day to 10 g/day, representing a reduction of 43% for the total sugar intake from RTECs. Combet et al., who tested the capacity of a multi-nutrient profiling system for product reformulation, found average reductions between 19% and 38% [51].",
    "Food reformulation can be a challenge, especially as nutrients such as sodium, fat, and sugar often play a role in the technological and sensorial functions in these products. Sugar, for example, is used for taste or texture, for preservation, and as a bulking agent, and salt is a preservative that prevents spoilage",
    "[52,53]. In Portugal, food products' reformulation was established under co-regulation agree- ments with the food industry in the framework of the Integrated Strategy for the Promotion of Healthy Eating (EIPAS) [54].",
    "The \"Food Industry Co-Regulation Agreement\" covers the reformulation of several food products high in salt, sugar, and trans fatty acids, as well as the main dietary sources of these nutrients, for the Portuguese population. The principles of the reformulation include reducing salt content between 12% and 30% and sugar content between 7% and 10% by 2021. The current agreement covers the reformulation of breakfast cereals establishing a reduction target of 10% for salt (sodium) and sugar contents.",
    "This will be achieved by setting progressive reduction targets for each food and drink category [55].",
    "Food reformulation strategies based on setting targets for progressive reduction or increase of key nutrients are crucial to avoid consumers switching to another product or changing the amount they consume when, for example, the product's levels of added sugar or salt are changed. The taste and texture of foods after reformulation will also influence consumption at a population level [56-58].",
    "Considering the WHO recommendations for the intake of free sugars per day (<5% Energy) [36], children of 3 to 10 years old should have an upper daily limit of free sugars of 14-23 g [35], respectively.",
    "In this study, if we assign 100% of total sugars as added sugar for RTECs [59], and consider that the breakfast meal represents 20% of the energy of children's daily reference values and nutrient intake, the reformulation scenario showed the RTECs representing 44-73% of the daily reference value for free sugars through the consumption of RTECs. The reformulation scenario contributes to a considerable reduction in total daily sugar intake from RTEC, although these still represent a higher contribution to the daily free sugars intake, in particular for young children.",
    "For most lipid components, no reference values are proposed by EFSA [35].",
    "In this case, we decided to follow the nutrient-based standards for planning nutritionally balanced menus developed by Public Health England, which recommend not more than 11% of energy as a reference value for saturated fatty acids [37]. For a 1500 kcal diet, this would be 18 g SFA per day. The reformulation scenario showed that RTECs contributed to 3.3% of the total SFA intake, reflecting a non-significant result to the contribution to SFA intake and diet quality.",
    "On the other hand, for salt intake, children of 3 to 10 years old should have an upper daily limit of salt of 2.75-4.25 g [35], respectively. Our study revealed that salt intake through breakfast cereals consumption ranged between 0.444 g/day for the scenario without reformulation (current formulation of breakfast cereals) to 0.439 g/day for the Foods 2021, 10, 1772 14 of 19 scenario with reformulation, which represents a reduction of 1.1% in daily salt intake. These results showed that cereals have been produced with lower levels of salt across all of the different cereal categories considered, and this represents a non-significant contribution to salt intake and diet quality of the RTECs.",
    "Pombo-Rodrigues et al.'s study also described similar results concerning the sodium or salt levels in RTECs [60].",
    "According to EFSA, the adequate intake for fiber is 10-16 g/day for children between 3 to 10 years old [35]. Considering the reformulation of RTECs, we observed an average increase of 34% in the daily dietary fiber intake.",
    "IAN-AF revealed that the mean intake of fiber was 14 g per day for children under 10 years. The present results support the inclusion of dietary fiber in the NPM-PT model, contributing to the improvement of its intake and complying with the recommendations for fiber dietary recommendation intake.",
    "Comparing two typical Portuguese children's breakfast options of RTEC children consumers (250 mL of milk + 30 g portion of RTECs reformulated + 50 g portion of bread) and non-RTEC children consumers (250 mL of milk + 50 g portion of bread) at breakfast, the RTEC consumers have a nutrient intake on average of 23.5 g total sugars, 1.4 g salt, 3.1 g saturated fat, and 4.6 g fiber, representing total sugars as 6.0% of the total energy intake (TEI), salt between 33% and 51%; fiber between 33% and 46%, and saturated fat at 1.9% of the TEI of the daily nutrient intake in children. For non-RTEC children consumers, the breakfast provides a nutrient intake on average of 13.5 g total sugars, 0.97 g salt, 2.4 g SFA, and 2.2 g fiber, representing total sugars with 3.4% of the TEI, salt between 23% and 35%; fiber between 16% and 22%, and saturated fat with 1.4% of the TEI of the daily nutrient intake in children [3,35,37,61]. Compared with non-cereal breakfast consumers, breakfast cereal consumers had higher intakes of dietary fiber and total sugars.",
    "This finding is consistent with Fayet-Moore et al.'s study [45].",
    "These results can provide the food industry with an overall picture of RTECs' nutrient daily intake contribution to modify the products to be healthier and more beneficial. This is the first study applying a national policymaking tool, the NPM-PT model, to classify RTECs as suitable/unsuitable for marketing to children.",
    "In this study we assessed the potential of nutrient profiling models to guide food reformulation, contributing to changing the food environment and improving children's nutritional intake. In order to reach its full potential, reformulation should be implemented across the food sector. Further studies are needed to suppress some drawbacks of this study including the following:**** For some categories of cereals (e.g., gluten-free and organic children's RTECs) the number of samples considered was low (<15); however, the sample reflected the products available in the market.",
    "The presented results constitute a snapshot of the RTECs available on the market in a particular period. The reformulation scenario is a theoretical study; therefore, we did not assess the sensory properties of RTECs after reformulation, and we assumed that children will consume the same amount of reformulated RTECs. Future research should address the issues raised here, including sensory analysis and determining the children's acceptability of these new products. This research reflected only RTECs, and upcoming research focusing on other food groups, e.g., fruit-based snacks, bread and bakery products, convenience foods, and yogurts, will allow for a more accurate nutritional profile to be defined for food products marketed to children.",
    "* Access to data on added sugars would help to identify the exact amount of sugar consumed that was added to food during its production. Easier access to composition data of high-quality branded food is also needed.* Finally, future research should explore the impact of reformulation of target nutrients on health outcomes and quality of life measures i.e., quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).",
    "Foods 2021, 10, 1772 15 of 19 5. Conclusions Although nutrient profiling does not address all aspects of nutrition, diet, or health, it is a helpful tool to use in conjunction with interventions aimed at improving diets. It can also be used in implementing the recommendations on the marketing of foods to children. From our study, 87% of RTECs had a sugar content >15 g/100 g, responsible for the highest percentage of non-compliance in the evaluation by the various nutrient profile models. Considering the used models, NPM-PT provides very similar results to the WHO nutrient profile model in terms of its purpose, enabling a good level of agreement.",
    "As demonstrated in the current study, the process of reformulation of RTECs, namely, to reduce salt and sugar contents, is recommend and should not compromise their global nutritional profile. It is important to define feasible reduction targets without having to replace them with other ingredients, such as sugar by sweeteners. Additionally, it is necessary to define a gradual reduction to achieve the adaptation by the consumer to products with a lower amount of salt and sugar. To summarize, this study provides the food industry with a general picture of children RTECs' nutritional profiles, mainly focusing on reducing sugars and salt and increasing fiber, offering healthier products.",

    "Digital Health; Nutrition; Data for Decision-Making; Health Information Systems INTRODUCTION: Health information systems (HIS) play a critical role in aggregating and integrating data fromhealth facilities and communities to improve health services delivery and health systems functioning[1]. However, the availability of high-quality, reliable, and sufficient data can be a challenge in low-middle-income countries (LMICs), which are often characterized by fragmented governancestructures, a lack of human resource capacity, and weak digital infrastructure and monitoring systems[2].",
    "Nutrition HIS, also known as Nutrition Information Systems (NIS), focuses specifically onnutrition-related indicators to understand and address challenges related to malnutrition and foodsecurity [3]. NIS can play a key role in shaping policy and programs for improving the nutritionalstatuses of populations, and can guide nutrition programming integration into the routinely providedhealth services",
    "[3]. However, the bottlenecks that plague HIS broadly also impede the effective useof NIS.",
    "Disjointed efforts to improve the availability, accessibility, quality, and use of health datahave limited countries' ability to use data for health decision-making and problem-solving [4]. Evidence-based decision-making is integral to improving public health benefits andresources, and for translating quality evidence into action to achieve health impact, especially inLMICs [5-7].",
    "Key components of adopting an evidence-based public health approach involves thesystematic use of data and HIS, community engagement in decision-making, and having trust in thedata being used for decision-making [8]. Though evidence-informed decision-making is stronglyencouraged by key public health decision-makers, the mechanisms of its implementation remain lessstraightforward and untested [7,9-13]. Data visualization tools (DVT) have been recommended to support decision-making to betterunderstand data and prioritize next steps; however, their use remains an unexplored field of researchin LMICs [10].",
    "Dashboards, a type of DVT, are used to display relevant summary healthperformance metrics using visualization techniques (e.g., graphs), which provide timely andactionable feedback that informs the decision-making of health providers (e.g., health managers,supervisors) [11] and ultimately strengthen the overall quality of care delivered [14].",
    "Dashboardsenable the regular review of data by key stakeholders and decision-makers in identifying data gapsand following up with corrective actions to improve overall health performance; moreover, they cancapture information on data quality and completeness [2]. However, like the use of HIS broadly -their existence alone is not a silver-bullet solution to improving data monitoring and increasingevidence-based decision-making. Furthermore, having more available data does not necessarily JMIR Preprints Fesshaye et al https://preprints.jmir.org/preprint/48294 [unpublished, peer-reviewed preprint] translate into more evidence-based programs and policies in global health",
    "[10]. Their impact onimproving patient care and health outcomes remains unclear, with only a few studies havinginvestigated how dashboards have been integrated into the decision-making process within primaryhealth care systems [14].",
    "Need for effective data use in Bangladesh to track nutrition indicators Bangladesh developed their NIS in the early 2010s, which is integrated into the national HIS.Bangladesh has one of the world's largest deployments of the open-source District HealthInformation Software 2 (DHIS-2), and has been able to integrate previously fragmented data systemsinto a central data repository - making Bangladesh one of the more digitally mature LMICs[15]. AsBangladesh's nutritional programming is provided under two distinct Directorates under the Ministryof Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) - the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) andthe Directorate General of Family Planning (DGFP) - the NIS plays a critical role in integratingnutrition-related service data into one system which provides an overview of national nutritionprogress [16]. The Nutrition Information and Planning Unit (NIPU) - a joint effort from theGovernment of Bangladesh and UNICEF - was established to provide dedicated personnel to workwith the NIS and support use of its data for decision-making.",
    "One of NIPU's developments was theMukto dashboard - which is a free, open access platform to view nutrition-related performanceindicators at the national, district, and sub-district levels [16].However, despite these efforts and advancements, the research agenda around the effectiveuse of nutrition data to guide key priorities and decisions in Bangladesh remains relatively nascent. There is an increasing need to develop and strengthen the use of high-quality, reliable, and timelydata to accelerate progress in achieving nutrition-related goals.",
    "This is especially of importance inBangladesh, where - despite the substantial progress it has made in food access and nutritional statusof the population - malnutrition and food insecurity continues to remain high: over 30% of childrenunder-5 are stunted [17]; 22% of children under-5 are underweight [17]; over 50% of pregnantwomen are anemic",
    "[18]; and only around 35% of children ages 6-23 months are fed a minimumacceptable diet, highlighting inadequate infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices in thecountry[17,18]. Addressing these nutritional needs has direct implications on both maternal andinfant mortality as well as their quality of life.",
    "Objective of the StudyThis study provides further context into the use of Bangladesh's NIS, including the Muktodashboard, and identifies areas of improvement so that the NIS can be used effectively andefficiently for evidence-based planning and data-driven actions to improve nutrition service deliveryand, more broadly, the nutritional status of communities. METHODS:",
    "Study Setting and Context: Key-informant interviews (KIIs) were conducted with stakeholders involved with both theNIS and the Mukto dashboard at the national level to understand the NIS landscape and challengeswith data use. Participants were identified purposively through consultations with Bangladesh'sNational Nutrition Services (NNS), UNICEF, and NIPU to identify those in both the government andnon-government sector that work with nutrition data and were perceived to utilize that data.",

    "Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, interviews were conducted virtually through Zoom betweenDecember 2020 and January 2021. All participants provided oral consent for both participation in theKIIs and recording of the interview.",

KIIs were conducted by two facilitators (IAT and TRW), both of whom havepost-graduate level training and received training on study design and research ethics. One facilitatoris the lead of mHealth initiatives at mPower identifying as male, while the other is a researchcoordinator, identifying as female.",
    "One facilitator led the KII and the second took notes with the twomaintaining the same roles throughout each interview. KIIs ranged from 1-2 hours, were conductedin Bangla or English based on the interviewee's preference, audio-recorded, and subsequentlytranscribed and translated into English. Study team members based in Bangladesh (IAT, MC, andTRW) completed the transcriptions, translations, and verification of the KIIs.",
    "Upon review of initialinterview transcripts, study team determined that data saturation was reached, and additionalinterviews were not necessary. Analysis KII data were coded and analyzed utilizing a thematic content analysis approach.",
    "Dataanalysis was conducted by a team of four (BF, LK, AK, and SP). An initial read through oftranscripts was performed to identify and discuss emerging themes.",
    "Creation of the codebook wasguided by the PATH Theory of Change for Accelerating Data Use in Health Systems (Figure 1) [19].The Theory of Change framework was developed by PATH for visualization of the process forstrengthening data systems and increasing data use, with the goal of improving health systems, overa ten-year period.

    "It has to be done. It has not been communicated with the urbansystem on behalf of the government counterpart.",
    "So they don't feel obliged to the nationallyharmonized indicator-based reporting. So they only do it when someone tells them orbackstopping them. \"-Non-government stakeholder Person powerStakeholders reported that data collection, management, analysis, and monitoring arefrequently executed manually, requiring significant person power.",
    "Additionally, high staff turnoverleads to the constant need for training. Reasons for staff turnover include transfer to other cadres,staff leaving after the completion of a project, and term-based NNS positions that do not set up apermanent workforce.",
    "Many stakeholders also suggested that regular training of all relevant persons, such as JMIR Preprints Fesshaye et al https://preprints.jmir.org/preprint/48294 [unpublished, peer-reviewed preprint] community health workers (CHWs), data analysts, and policymakers should occur to help mitigateerrors during data collection, management, and analysis.",
    "Currently, although there are trainersdeployed at the field level and national levels - for government staff -, there remains to be some gapsas government and NGOs variably provide such trainings to their respective staffs.

    "We found that trust in the quality of nutritiondata is lacking among stakeholders, mainly due to errors occurring at the data collection phase. Thesefindings are similar to those conducted in Kenya and Malawi, which showed that routine datacollected at the field level is regularly perceived as poor quality [23]",
    "[24] [25].",
    "Possible reasons forpoor quality data in other settings ranged from unstandardized data collection to lack of training [25],which echo the concerns of stakeholders in Bangladesh. Perceptions of data usability were influenced by data quality and existing discrepanciesbetween rural and urban data.",
    "Bangladesh's sub-national discrepancies in data have been perpetuatedby the lack of accountability and support for urban areas coupled with historic focus of nutritionservices in rural areas [22]. Another usability issue noted is unstandardized nutrition indicators whichlead to inconsistencies during data collection.",
    "Person power was also a central theme as stakeholdersreported that manual data management is hindered by high staff turnover and that staff trainingshould take place regularly. Other studies in LMICs including Bangladesh, have also shown that fieldlevel staff turnover is high while motivation is low, negatively affecting data quality and staffperformance [26,27]. Poor internet connection at the field level is a barrier for person power as itinterferes with data collection, staff training, and capacity development.",
    "The importance of usingdata for decision-making was stressed by stakeholders and despite knowledge of dashboards, likeMukto, decision-makers tend to receive data from their own preferred sources. A study conducted inMozambique found that dashboards were viewed as an externally (non-government) developedstrategy and garnered minimal interest from stakeholders, leading to the discontinuation of their usein this setting [24]. While our results did not reveal explicit reasons for the limited use of dashboardsin the decision-making process, other settings may reveal possible causes. Addressing these possiblecauses will allow nutrition indicator dashboards, such as the Mukto dashboard, reach their fullpotential.",
    "Data Ecosystems for Effective Decision-MakingGovernments globally are increasingly utilizing data to support their functions and decision-making capabilities [28]. Data systems are complex, and decision-makers are often far removed fromthe entire data lifecycle - from data capture, compilation, distillation, and processing to visualizationand reporting. While data visualization tools can be leveraged to improve the use of data for globalhealth decision-making [10], we found that decision-makers first have to trust that the data isbelievable, credible, timely, and responsive in order to use it.",
    "Generating this trust starts with havingclear governance, leadership, and support for those who are at the genesis of the data ultimatelypresented in the summary program performance reports and dashboards. Trust also arises fromrelevant persons having salient roles in construction and upkeep of the systems housing data",

    "[29]. Continuous monitoring of progress and areasof improvement requires an ecosystem of reliable, timely, trusted, and actionable data which mayarise from the use of digital visualization tools such as dashboards. Importantly, data ecosystems should be localized and tailored to any setting or context, andpresent key public health decision-makers with actionable messages to optimize decision-makingand translate knowledge into health practice, with the ultimate goal of improving health outcomesand reducing health inequalities.",

Gaps exist in nutrition data anddecision-makers do not feel confident in data collection and quality. Continued improvement innutrition-related health outcomes will require tailoring of the Bangladesh nutrition data ecosystemalong with increased ownership among stakeholders.",
    "Power, trust, and worker motivationImproving data quality, trust, and use cannot occur without establishing an environment thatfosters worker motivation. CHWs, who are the cornerstone of primary healthcare systems globallyby providing health services to hard-to-reach and rural communities, simultaneously play animportant role in collecting health services (including nutrition-based services) data",
    "[26,33].Bangladesh's CHW program faces significant levels of attrition and high workloads, with someCHWs reporting discontent with their positions [26]. In our study, stakeholders expressed a lack oftrust in data collected by CHWs and reported that field level staff believed many tasks were extrawork. However, the unrealistic workloads regularly placed on field staff",
    "[26] are likely the cause ofthe negative sentiments reported. Negative stakeholder perceptions of CHWs may be detrimental tothe overall motivation and productivity of staff, further decreasing quality of and trust in data. Motivation and satisfaction among CHWs can be undermined by both external factors such asprogram structure and provision of training, as well as internal factors such as satisfaction with workand CHWs' perception of relevant stakeholders [27,33].",
    "It is critical to also consider how gender and power dynamics impact relationships betweenfield level and high-level staff. Gender roles can shape CHW experiences and relationships withdecision-makers [34]. A majority of the global health workforce, which includes CHWs, are womenwith relatively low socioeconomic status and education, while only 30% of global health leadershiproles are occupied by women[34,35].",
    "Our interviewees expressed concern about the high workerturnover, yet specific reasons for this turnover were largely unspecified. Previous research has shownthat reasons for attrition among women CHWs in Bangladesh include competing familycommitments, disapproval from family members, and insufficient income",
    "[34,36]. GivenBangladesh's reliance on CHWs for field-level data collection and service provision, a gender lens iscritical for identifying appropriate solutions.",
    "Some solutions that have been shown to increase health worker motivation includereasonable workloads, positive relationships with decision-makers, sufficient monetarycompensation, and recognition of efforts [26,27].",
    "Without taking worker motivation and satisfactioninto account, it is difficult to ensure high quality data at the field level that decision-makers will trust. Necessary improvements in worker motivation should come from those in leadership positions whohave the power to affect change in work environments.",
    "Responsibility to increase data quality cannotfall solely on the backs of field level workers as pressure to sustain large workloads and insufficientsupport from leadership are factors that decrease motivation and accuracy [26,27].Innovative Data Systems and System ImprovementsThe number of interactive dashboards and other DVTs, especially in the nutrition sector, haveincreased in recent years [37]. This is partly due to increased investments in nutrition that haveincreased the availability of data for decision-makers and researchers [38].",
    "However, the \"build it JMIR Preprints Fesshaye et al https://preprints.jmir.org/preprint/48294 [unpublished, peer-reviewed preprint] and they will come\" approach has been shown not to work",

    "We found that while government and non-government stakeholders wereaware of dashboards, most did not utilize them in their decision-making process. Furthermore, theuse of data dashboards does not guarantee improved data use and quality without sufficient user dataliteracy, important research considerations, and an established environment of trust among keydecision makers. Moreover, the selection of key dashboard indicators to assess primary healthcareperformance also depends on the availability of data, which often is lacking in LMICs",
    "[11]. Dataecosystems, which include data visualizations and dashboards, must have the capacity for constantimprovements and iterative changes. Users must be motivated by the innovativeness and benefit ofthese tools to confidently and effectively employ them in the decision-making process.

    "LimitationsThis study is not without limitations, Due to the study design, results may be influenced by socialdesirability bias. Also, due the sample size and methods, results are likely not generalizable to othersettings.",
    "ConclusionWe believe this study is valuable as it provides insights to stakeholder experience andsuggestions for effective use of nutrition data systems in Bangladesh. Although the creation of datasystems and dashboards are important to increase the transparency of data, the mere creation of thesesystems may not solve Bangladesh's NIS performance monitoring needs, as a clear intended userbase, and accountable stakeholders must be present at onset.",
    "Systems should be in place to ensureauthenticity and credibility at the point of generation, with steps being taken to correct erroneousdata. Data collection, management, and monitoring require robust, permanent human resources andstrong infrastructure, as well as strong government and community engagement at each step of thedata generation process. Although these recommendations are not necessarily a prescription for success, increasing thepresence of credible data ecosystems can enhance decision-making efforts.

Singer, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, and approved February 14, 2007 (received for review December 9, 2006) Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) intended to reduce infec- tious contacts between persons form an integral part of plans to mitigate the impact of the next influenza pandemic.",
    "Although the potential benefits of NPIs are supported by mathematical models, the historical evidence for the impact of such interventions in past pandemics has not been systematically examined. We obtained data on the timing of 19 classes of NPI in 17 U.S. cities during the 1918 pandemic and tested the hypothesis that early implementa- tion of multiple interventions was associated with reduced disease transmission.",
    "Consistent with this hypothesis, cities in which mul- tiple interventions were implemented at an early phase of the epidemic had peak death rates (cid:1)50% lower than those that did not and had less-steep epidemic curves. Cities in which multiple inter- ventions were implemented at an early phase of the epidemic also showed a trend toward lower cumulative excess mortality, but the difference was smaller ((cid:1)20%) and less statistically significant than that for peak death rates.",
    "This finding was not unexpected, given that few cities maintained NPIs longer than 6 weeks in 1918. Early implementation of certain interventions, including closure of schools, churches, and theaters, was associated with lower peak death rates, but no single intervention showed an association with improved aggregate outcomes for the 1918 phase of the pandemic.",
    "These findings support the hypothesis that rapid implementation of multiple NPIs can significantly reduce influenza transmission, but that viral spread will be renewed upon relaxation of such measures. mitigation (cid:1) nonpharmaceutical interventions (cid:1) closures I nfluenza pandemics have occurred periodically in human popu- lations, with three pandemics in the 20th century.",
    "The 1918 influenza pandemic resulted in unprecedented mortality, with an estimated 500,000-675,000 deaths in the U.S. and 50-100 million deaths worldwide (1-3). The spread of H5N1 avian influenza has provoked public concern (4) and accelerated efforts to plan for the next pandemic.",
    "Because antiviral medications and effective vac- cines may not be widely available at the beginning of a pandemic, many authorities have suggested using nonpharmaceutical inter- ventions (NPIs; i.e., voluntary quarantine of infected households, closure of schools, bans on public gatherings, and other measures) to decrease disease transmission. This approach is supported by mathematical models, which suggest that multiple simultaneous NPIs applied early in an epidemic may significantly reduce disease transmission (5).",
    "A recent review, however, concluded that the evidence base for recommending such interventions is limited, consisting primarily of historical and contemporary observations, rather than controlled studies (6). The intensity of the 1918 pandemic, whether assessed as total excess deaths, the rate of increase in the epidemic curve, or peak death rates, varied widely among U.S. cities. Cities also varied widely in their choice and timing of implementation of NPIs designed to reduce disease spread.",
    "Many cities closed schools, churches, theaters, dance halls, or other public accommodations; made influenza a notifiable disease; banned funerals or other public gatherings; or introduced isolation of sick persons. In some cases, these NPIs were put in place in the first days of epidemic spread in a city, whereas in other cases, they were introduced late or not at all (Table 1). We noted that, in some cases, outcomes appear to have corre- lated with the quality and timing of the public health response.",
    "The contrast of mortality outcomes between Philadelphia and St. Louis is particularly striking (Fig. 1). The first cases of disease among civilians in Philadelphia were reported on September 17, 1918, but authorities downplayed their significance and allowed large public gatherings, notably a city-wide parade on September 28, 1918, to continue. School closures, bans on public gatherings, and other social distancing interventions were not implemented until October 3, when disease spread had already begun to overwhelm local medical and public health resources. In contrast, the first cases of disease among civilians in St. Louis were reported on October 5, and authorities moved rapidly to introduce a broad series of measures designed to promote social distancing, implementing these on October 7.",
    "The difference in response times between the two cities ((cid:1)14 days, when measured from the first reported cases) represents approximately three to five doubling times for an influenza epidemic. The costs of this delay appear to have been significant; by the time Philadelphia responded, it faced an epi- demic considerably larger than the epidemic St. Louis faced. Philadelphia ultimately experienced a peak weekly excess pneumo- nia and influenza (P&I) death rate of 257/100,000 and a cumulative excess P&I death rate (CEPID) during the period September 8-December 28, 1918 (the study period) of 719/100,000.",
    "St. Louis, on the other hand, experienced a peak P&I death rate, while NPIs were in place, of 31/100,000 and had a CEPID during the study period of 347/100,000. Consistent with the predictions of modeling, the effect of the NPIs in St. Louis appear to have had a less- pronounced effect on CEPID than on peak death rates, and death rates were observed to climb after the NPIs were lifted in mid- November (7-9). To investigate whether early implementation of individual inter- ventions or of multiple measures reduces disease transmission during influenza pandemics, we analyzed the NPIs used in a collection of U.S. cities during the fall wave of the 1918 pandemic, identifying the NPIs used in each city as well as the timing of their implementation",

Results Effect of Early Interventions on Epidemic Spread. We assessed the relationship between the timing of NPIs and three measures of epidemic outcome: (i) the peak weekly rate of excess P&I deaths per 100,000 population (peak death rate) during the study period; (ii) the ''normalized'' peak weekly excess P&I death rate (peak weekly death rate during the study period divided by the median weekly rate during the period); and (iii) the CEPID per 100,000 population during the study period.

Cities that implemented three or fewer NPIs before 20/100,000 CEPID had a median peak weekly death rate of 146/100,000, compared with 65/100,000 in those implementing four or more NPIs by that time (Fig. 2a, P (cid:4) 0.005).",
    "The relationship was similar for normalized peak death rates and for a range of possible cutoffs (see Table 2, CEPID at time of intervention), although the relation- ship became weaker as later interventions were included. Cities with more early NPIs also had fewer total excess deaths during the study period (Fig. 2b, Table 2, 1918 total), but this association was weaker: cities with three or fewer NPIs before CEPID (cid:4) 20/100,000 experienced a median total excess death rate of 551/100,000, compared with a median rate of 405/100,000 in cities with four or more NPIs (P (cid:4) 0.03). The association of early intervention and lower peak death rates was also observed when cities were ranked according to the CEPID in each city at the time of the second, third, fourth, or fifth intervention (Table 2, CEPID at time of intervention).",
    "Similar relationships were again detected for the normalized peak death rate [Table 2, CEPID at time of intervention/Normalized peak]. Again, the relationship with total death rate was weaker and in this case not statistically significant.",
    "Effects of Individual Interventions. To assess whether particular NPIs were associated with better outcomes, we calculated a Spearman rank correlation coefficient between outcome mea- sures and the stage at which individual NPIs were implemented in each city (cities that never implemented a given intervention were ranked last in each analysis).",
    "Results are shown in Table 2, CEPID at time of. Early school, church, or theater closure was associated with lower peak excess death rates (Spearman (cid:1) (cid:4) 0.54-0.56, P (cid:4) 0.02).",
    "Cities that made each of these interven- tions before they reached 30/100,000 CEPID had a median peak death rate of 65-68/100,000, compared with median peaks of 127-146/100,000 for cities that made these interventions later or not at all (Fig. 2a, P (cid:4) 0.005-0.01).",
    "Announcements of school, church, and theater closures were linked in most cities, occurring within a span of (cid:2)6 days in the majority, and this near simul- taneity of implementation precludes multivariate analysis or strong inference about the relative importance of the individual NPIs. Early bans on public gatherings were also associated with lower peak excess death rates, but the statistical significance of this result depended on the test used [Table 2, CEPID at time of, and Fig.",
    "2a]. Of the other NPIs considered (closure of dance halls, other closures, isolation of cases, bans on public funerals, and making influenza notifiable), none showed a statistically significant association between the stage of implementation and the peak or cumulative excess death rates (Table 2, CEPID at time of, and Fig. 2).",
    "Other Predictors of Epidemic Severity. We assessed the correlation between peak mortality rate and each of the following variables: latitude, longitude, 1910 population density, 1920 population den- sity, 1918 population size, and epidemic start week, defined as the first week in which excess P&I mortality exceeded 10/100,000. Of these variables, only longitude (Spearman (cid:1) (cid:4) (cid:5)0.61, P (cid:4) 0.009) and epidemic start week (Spearman (cid:1) (cid:4) (cid:5)0.55, P (cid:4) 0.02) were significantly associated with the peak weekly excess P&I mortality rate, and these two variables were strongly associated with one another (Spearman (cid:1) (cid:4) 0.66, P (cid:4) 0.004), indicating that eastern U.S. cities were hit earlier in our data set.",
    "In addition, cities whose epidemics began later tended to intervene at an earlier stage of their 7584 (cid:1) www.pnas.org(cid:2)cgi(cid:2)doi(cid:2)10.1073(cid:2)pnas.0610941104 Hatchett et al. epidemics (Spearman (cid:1) (cid:4) 0.77, P (cid:4) 0.0003), presumably because local officials in these cities observed the effects of the epidemic along the Eastern seaboard and resolved to act quickly. In linear regressions of peak death rates vs. stage of the epidemic at the time of interventions (number of NPIs before CEPID (cid:4) 20/100,000) and timing of epidemic onset, the association of peak with intervention stage was statistically significant and stronger than that with epidemic onset in univariate models (SI Table 3).",
    "If both predictors are used in a bivariate regression, the point estimate for interventions remains unchanged while the p value increases to 0.13; no independent effect of week of onset is seen in this bivariate model. Similar results are found for longitude (data not shown). Subject to the caveats of performing a linear regression on only 17 cities with such highly correlated explanatory variables, this finding suggests that the relationship between early intervention and lower peak death rates is explained by factors of geography or timing of epidemic onset only to the extent that these factors influenced the quality of the public health response. Sensitivity Analyses.",
    "Similar results were obtained when the inter- vention date was defined as the date public health orders were promulgated (Table 2) or the last date a particular type of gathering was permitted (e.g., Sunday church service; SI Table 4). Results were identical or improved when 7- and 10-day lags in assessing CEPID were introduced to account for the lag between infection and death (SI Tables 5 and 6).",
    "Relationship Between Interventions and Subsequent Waves. Al- though it was not the primary intent of this paper to analyze pandemic wave dynamics, it is possible to formulate descriptive observations from the data at hand (SI Table 7). In offering these observations, it is important to underscore that in some cities, information about the dates of relaxation of the interventions used was incomplete.",
    "All cities showed some fluctuation in mortality rates after the main wave of the 1918 pandemic subsided. The peak weekly mortality rates observed in ''second waves'' in the cities we studied ranged from 13.60 to 79.69/100,000, as compared with 31.29- 256.96/100,000 during the first wave.",
    "There was a statistically significant inverse correlation of the height of the first and second peaks (Spearman (cid:1) (cid:4) (cid:5)0.53, P (cid:4) 0.03), so that cities that had low peaks during the first wave were at greater risk of a large second wave. Cities that had lower peak mortality rates during the first wave also tended to experience their second waves after a shorter interval of time, (cid:1)6-8 weeks after the first peak vs. 10-14 weeks for cities with higher peak mortality rates (Spearman (cid:1)(cid:4) (cid:5)0.84, P (cid:2) 0.0001).",
    "These patterns were also observed in cities that implemented NPIs sooner [as assessed by ranking the cities according to their CEPID at school closure (Spearman (cid:1)(cid:4) 0.63, P (cid:4) 0.006) or CEPID at time of the fourth intervention (Spearman (cid:1)(cid:4) 0.52, P (cid:4) 0.03)]. Finally, and this is perhaps the most important observation, no city in our analysis experienced a second wave while its main battery of NPIs was in place. Second waves occurred only after the relaxation of interventions.",
    "Discussion Comparisons across 17 U.S. cities show that the first peak in excess P&I death rates during the fall wave of the 1918 influenza pandemic was (cid:1)50% lower in cities that implemented multiple NPIs to control disease spread early in their epidemics than in cities that made such interventions late or not at all. This finding suggests that such interventions may be capable of significantly reducing the rate of disease transmission so long as they remain in effect. If NPIs were maintained indefinitely once they were put in place, one would expect that early interventions would be associated with a reduction in both the peak incidence (and therefore peak death rate) and also in the cumulative incidence or cumulative excess death rate.",
    "However, NPIs used in 1918 did not last indefinitely; rather, most of the NPIs in the study cities appear to have been relaxed within 2-8 weeks, whereas opportunities for reintroduction and transmission of the pandemic virus extended for many months. If highly effective NPIs are put in place early in the epidemic, and these result in a smaller epidemic, then a large proportion of the population will remain susceptible to the renewed spread of the virus once interventions are relaxed. In the absence of an effective method of otherwise inducing immunity in the uninfected popu- lation (i.e., a well matched vaccine), such an epidemic is likely to have two phases, with the first phase mitigated by NPIs and the second commencing after NPIs are relaxed.",
    "In our review of 17 cities, we observed that cities that implemented NPIs sooner had lower peak mortality rates during the first wave and were at greater risk of a large second wave. These cities also tended to experience their second waves after a shorter interval of time. As described above, no city in our analysis experienced a second wave while its main battery of NPIs was in place, and second waves occurred only after the relaxation of NPIs.",
    "A mitigated two-phase epidemic may result in a cumulative burden of morbidity and mortality less than that observed in a single unchecked epidemic because of reduced epidemic overshoot (7-9). However, the relationship between the timing of transiently main- tained NPIs and final outcomes will be complicated and not necessarily monotonic (10). Because our goal was to assess the evidence for an effect of NPIs on transmission, rather than to assess whether the particular NPIs in 1918 were sustained long enough to prevent epidemic spread altogether, we defined peak death rates a priori as the main outcome measure.",
    "Consistent with these expec- tations, the relationship between intervention timing and peak death rates was stronger and statistically more convincing than that with total death rates in 1918. The most important limitation of our study is that we used observed weekly excess fatality rates as a proxy for weekly com- munity morbidity rates, which are not available for the study period. We believe that untransformed excess mortality rates are the most reliable (and least assumption-laden) record of the effects of the pandemic, but it is important to note that case fatality proportions (CFP) in 1918 appear to have varied between populations [being higher, for example, among the Inuit than in the general United States population (1)], likely as a result of differing levels of general public health, and it is possible that they varied between cities in the United States for similar reasons.",
    "Varying patterns of bacterial colonization or other, unidentified factors could also have contrib- uted to variation in CFP. Differences in CFP between the cities could introduce a systematic error into our results (because they would lead to higher total deaths at a given stage of the epidemic, and higher peaks, in the same subset of cities). Our use of a normalized peak death rate was designed to avoid this error. If our results were artifacts of city-to-city variation in CFP, then the associations found should become weaker after this normalization; in fact, each of the strongest associations was at least comparably strong after the normalization (Table 2, Normalized peak), suggest- ing that variation in CFP did not create the associations we found.",
    "More generally, a possible explanation for our findings is that inherently small epidemics (i.e., epidemics with flatter and smaller overall mortality curves, because of variation in CFP or in other factors not considered in our analysis) could appear to be associated with earlier interventions as an artifact of how we defined ''early.'' If this were the case, however, even ineffectual NPIs, considered individually, should correlate with lower peak mortality rates.",
    "In fact, NPIs that seem less likely to block transmission directly (e.g., making influenza a notifiable disease, closing dance halls, and bans on public funerals) had no such association. That several individual interventions were found not to be associated with lower peaks suggests this statistical artifact is not present.",
    "Previous authors have noted that epidemics that started later tended to be milder and have speculated that this might be due to Hatchett et al. PNAS (cid:1) May 1, 2007 (cid:1) vol. 104 (cid:1)",
    "no. 18 (cid:1) 7585YRATNEMMOCEESSECNEICSLACIDEM attenuation of the causative virus (3). Although viral attenuation may explain changes in the CFP over the course of the pandemic period (which extended to approximately March 1920), this mech- anism seems an unlikely explanation for the striking variability of outcomes during the 1918 fall wave, given the marked transmissi- bility of the lethal virus and the short intervals between the onset of epidemics in different cities.",
    "A potentially more plausible expla- nation is that public health and political authorities in cities that were struck later responded more quickly and aggressively because they had several weeks' notice of the severity of the pandemic. Subject to the caveats attendant on a linear regression in such a small data set, we found that the stage of the epidemic at the time of interventions predicted peak mortality better than timing of epidemic onset. This finding suggests that the association between early intervention and lower peak mortality may be explained in large part by the fact that later-hit cities responded more promptly.",
    "Similar results were obtained when longitude was included in the analysis along with or in place of time of epidemic onset. Although we do not know of any mechanistic hypothesis connecting longitude directly to epidemic severity, our analysis similarly suggests that longitude is not an important confounder of our results.",
    "In a related vein, the analysis of second peaks adds credence to the inference that NPIs were responsible for the observed lower first peaks in cities that implemented NPIs promptly. If lower first peaks were attributable to some other mechanism (e.g., a less virulent virus, seasonal changes in transmission, etc.), it is difficult to explain why, upon relaxation of NPIs, these low-peak cities tended to have larger second peaks.",
    "On the other hand, if NPIs curtailed the first wave, leaving more susceptibles in the early-intervention cities, then one would expect a more severe second wave in these cities, as was observed. Altogether, we take these findings as evidence that NPIs were capable of reducing influenza transmission in 1918, but that their benefits (as one would expect) were limited to the time they remained in effect.",
    "In sensitivity analyses, we found that associations between early intervention and better outcomes were strengthened when we timed interventions based on the cumulative excess deaths up to 7 or 10 days after the intervention, an effort to account for the delay expected from case incidence (which is affected by interventions) to mortality. In part, this strengthening likely is due to the fact that delayed death figures better reflect the true stage of the epidemic at time of intervention.",
    "However, use of a delay time in this fashion raises concerns about reverse causality. If a delay longer than the shortest time from infection to death is used (e.g., the median, rather than the minimum, time to death), then the number of deaths before intervention, the independent variable in our analysis, is affected by the intervention itself.",
    "To avoid such difficulties, we took as our primary analysis the simpler, more conservative ap- proach of defining the stage of the epidemic based on the date of intervention, with no delay. This choice has the additional benefit that in future pandemics, the cumulative excess death rate at the time of an intervention is in principle knowable in nearly real time, whereas the delayed death rate cannot by definition be known at the time of an intervention. The implications of our analysis should be interpreted with care.",
    "Our univariate analyses of the relationship between individual NPIs and outcomes are consistent with the hypothesis that social dis- tancing through closure of particular institutions (schools, churches, and theaters) led to reduced transmission, but the similarities in timing of various NPIs within a given city make it very difficult to discriminate the relative contributions of individual interventions (Fig. 2). Similarly, it was not possible to evaluate the effects of NPIs that were undertaken only in a small number of cities, or that were generally implemented only late in the epidemic, if at all, such as mass transit interventions (rules forbidding crowding and introduc- tion of staggered business hours to reduce crowding on mass transit) or mask ordinances. Whether these NPIs might have made a difference in particular cities where they were implemented early, such early implementation was not common enough to evaluate whether it was associated with better outcomes.",
    "A third consider- ation is that the historical record is not seamless, and it is possible that our source material did not capture the full range of interven- tions used or reflect the true timing of implementation of those it identifies. Finally, we note that causality may be complicated; the interventions used may themselves have produced the observed effects, or they could have worked by shaping perceptions about the epidemic and causing changes in unmeasured private behaviors.",
    "Despite these caveats about the details of interpretation, the relationships detected in our analyses strongly suggest that the aggressive implementation of NPIs resulted in flatter epidemic curves and a trend toward better overall outcomes in the fall of To the extent that these results provide evidence that multiple NPIs can reduce influenza transmission and mitigate the impact of a pandemic, they should inform current efforts related to pandemic preparedness. In particular, our results underscore the need for prompt action by public health authorities.",
    "The strongest relation- ship between peak death rates and timing of NPIs was observed for the number of interventions in place before the CEPID exceeded 20/100,000. If we assume a 2% CFP, this approximately corresponds to interventions undertaken before the deaths caused by infections in 1% of the population in a given city had occurred.",
    "Given the rate of growth of the pandemic and the lag between infection and death, perhaps 3-6% of the population would have been infected at this time. This finding emphasizes the need for very rapid interventions to stem the spread of the disease.",
    "Communities that prepare to implement layered NPIs aggressively are likely to achieve better outcomes than communities that introduce such interventions reactively, and they may be better positioned to manage the disruption caused by the more stringent interventions, such as school closure. Finally, an important practical issue that requires further study is the question of when such interventions can be relaxed. The implication of patterns observed in the timing and severity of second waves in 1918 seems clear, however.",
    "In the absence of an effective vaccine, cities that use NPIs to mitigate the impact of a pandemic remain vulnerable. In practice, and until emergency vaccine production capacity increases, this means that in the event of a severe pandemic, cities will likely need to maintain NPIs for longer than the 2-8 weeks that was the norm in 1918.",
    "Methods Historical Data. We defined our study period as September 8-De- cember 28, 1918, encompassing the first 16 weeks for which excess P&I death rates were reported by ref. 11.",
    "Of the 45 cities reported in ref. 11, we eliminated those cities for which (cid:3)4 weeks during the study period had missing or partial data (partial data included excess pneumonia deaths only or excess influenza deaths only). Of the remaining cities, we included in the final analysis those 17 cities for which we were able to obtain a complete account of public health responses during the study period from our research in period newspapers, public health reports, or municipal records; from consultations with current public health officials in the study cities; or from well documented secondary sources. We defined 19 interventions, or categories of public health responses (NPIs, measures) and scored the date on which a city implemented each of these interventions. Citations for the scoring of individual NPIs in each city are provided in SI Appendix.",
    "Interventions. Cities were scored as implementing an intervention if available evidence suggested that a measure was implemented on a community-wide basis through policy actions. Cities attempting to influence public behavior through exhortation alone (e.g., a rec- ommendation to ''avoid crowds'' without an explicit ban on their formation) were not scored as implementing an intervention.",

    "Timing of NPIs was assessed relative to the epidemic in each city by defining the ''stage'' of an epidemic for a given intervention as the estimated CEPID from September 8, 1918, through the calen- dar date on which the intervention was announced. Linear inter- polation was used for cumulative deaths when this date was between weekly reporting dates in ref. 11.",
    "In sensitivity analyses performed to account for the interval between infection (the true measure of transmission) and death (an outcome of infection), we also con- sidered lags of 7 or 10 days in calculating the CEPID, that is, defining the stage of the epidemic at which an intervention was implemented as the CEPID 7 or 10 days after the date of inter- vention (the median time from infection to death in autopsy reports tabulated in ref. 12 was (cid:1)10 days).",
    "In a separate sensitivity analysis, we defined the date of the intervention as the last day that a particular activity was possible, rather than the date on which it was if a ban on church services was banned. Thus, for example, announced on a day other than Sunday, the last activity date was defined as the preceding Sunday; likewise, if school closure was announced during a weekend, the last activity date was the pre- ceding Friday.",
    "The timing of a city's overall response was scored in two closely related ways. First, the number of NPIs (of a possible 19) an- nounced by a city before the CEPID reached a particular threshold (e.g., 20/100,000) was quantified as ''number of interventions before CEPID (cid:4) 20/100,000.'' This threshold was varied from 10 to 40/100,000 to encompass the range in which there was substantial intercity variation. Second, the CEPID at the time of the first intervention imposed in a city, the second intervention, and so on up to the sixth intervention was calculated.",
    "Outcomes. Epidemic outcomes were measured as (i) the first weekly peak excess death rate during the fall wave of the pandemic; (ii) normalized peak death rate: the ratio of i to the median weekly death rate for a given city during the study period; and (iii) cumulative excess deaths during the study period. Outcome ii was selected as a measure of the ''peakedness'' of the epidemic curve that would be insensitive to intercity differences in the CFP.",

    "10 are provided in SI Table 11. SI Tables 7-11 are in Excel format. Analysis.",
    "To avoid issues of reverse causality and reduce some forms of confounding, the data were analyzed in a fashion similar to an ''intention to treat'' analysis: that is, NPIs were scored on the date they were announced, and the duration, effectiveness, or other features of the intervention were not considered in the analysis. Associations between overall intervention timing and outcomes were assessed by Spearman rank correlation coefficients and as- sociated P values calculated between the measures of overall response (number of interventions before CEPID (cid:4) x or CEPID at the time of the xth intervention) and the three outcome measures. Univariate associations between the timing of particular NPIs and the outcomes were also assessed by Spearman rank correlation coefficients and associated P values. In these cases, multivariate analyses were not performed because of the small sample size and strong collinearity of many intervention timings.",
    "Because of specific concerns that later-hit cities might have had milder epidemics for reasons other than interventions, we did perform linear regression of peak death rate on longitude and epidemic onset week, along with intervention timing (number of interventions before CEPID (cid:4) 20/100,000) and eliminated model variables by backward selection. For NPIs that showed significant or nearly significant overall correlations with outcomes, we divided cities as evenly as possible into early and late-intervening cities (eight in the early group and nine in the late or vice versa) and plotted the median outcome for each group.",

    "in this issue of JGIM offers one more piece of evidence to indicate that this medium is not operating as intended, and to force us to consider alternatives to the status quo.3 First, it is important to consider the history and original purpose of direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising. In the 1960s, Congress granted the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulating authority of prescription drug labeling and advertising.",
    "This authority included ensuring that ads (1) were not false or misleading, (2) presented a Bfair balance^ of both drug risks and benefits, (3) included facts that are Bmaterial^ to a drug's advertised uses, and (4) included a Bbrief summary^ that notes every risk described in the drug's labeling.1 While the first DTC advertisement was a Merck print advertisement for the Pneumovax(r) vaccine in 1981, DTC advertising ex- ploded in the late 1990s after the FDA eased up on regulations for required risk information by stipulating that ads must include only the Bmajor risks^ and provide resources that consumers can be directed to for full risk information.1 As the regulating body of DTC advertising, the FDA is responsible for ensuring that advertising Bis truthful, balanced, and accurately communicated^ through regulation, surveil- lance, and education.4 In this capacity, the FDA has won substantial law suits and enforced penalties against pharma- ceutical companies.",
    "For example, in 2012, Glaxo Smith Kline paid $3 billion and Abbott paid $1.6 billion in penalties for miscommunicating information in DTC advertising, while Eli Lilly paid $1.4 billion and Pfizer paid $2.3 billion in 2009.5 Proponents of DTC advertising report that drug ads can serve many important roles for consumers. First, they may empower and engage patients to participate in their own health care through informing patients about disease, treatment options, Published online February 8, 2018 safety risks, and public health warnings.1, 6 Second, they may avert underuse of effective disease treatments, and potentially increase medication adherence.1, 6, 7 Finally, they may strength- en patients' relationships with their physicians.1, 4 Surveys conducted by the FDA in 2004 found that most surveyed physicians felt that DTC advertising made their patients more aware of treatments and feel more engaged in their own health care. Moreover, 27% of consumers were prompted to make an appointment with their physician to discuss a condition they had not previously discussed due to DTC advertising.4",
    "In contrast, critics have noted disproportionate risks and hazards related to DTC advertising. DTC ads have been shown to misinform patients by over-emphasizing treatment benefits, under-emphasizing treatment risks, and promoting drugs over healthy lifestyle choices.1, 6 DTC advertising may also lead to overutilization and inappropriate prescribing.6 In a study published in 2005 by Kravitz et al., standardized patients were randomly assigned to make brand name, general, and no drug requests for DTC-advertised antidepressants to 152 phy- sicians.",
    "Patients who requested drugs received them signifi- cantly more often than those who did not, suggesting patient requests have a dramatic effect on physician prescribing.7 Furthermore, critics argue that DTC advertising can impose strains on the patient-physician relationship and limit already limited appointment time with patients.1, 6 Perhaps the most significant critique of DTC advertising is its effects on rising drug costs due to over-prescribing of both inappropriate and brand name drugs (especially when cheaper generics are available).",
    "According to the Department of Health and Human Services, prescription drug spending in the US was about $457 billion in 2015.8 Much of these costs are absorbed by the government since Medicare and Medicaid are the single largest payers for prescription drugs. As such, the existing regulatory environment influences federal and state budgets, insurance premiums, and patient out-of-pocket costs.",
    "In the thoughtful study by Klara, et al., we see evidence of defects in the information provided by DTC advertising.3 The authors systematically assessed adherence of DTC advertise- ments to FDA guidelines for ads airing in the US between January 2015 and July 2016, with specific emphases on bal- anced presentation of risks and benefits, quality of data pre- sented, and off-label promotion. The authors found that among 97 advertisements reviewed by authors, the quality of data presented was low--26% provided quantitative information JGIM Parekh and Shrank: Dangers and Opportunities of Direct-to-Consumer Advertising for efficacy and benefit, 0% provided quantitative information on risks, and 13% promoted off-label use of medications (which is banned by the FDA). This study demonstrates that DTC-televised advertisements are not fulfilling their original intended purpose.",
    "The optimal role for the FDA as the regulating body of DTC ads is also commonly questioned. Many researchers (includ- ing the study authors) suggest that FDA guidelines are not prescriptive enough in terms of the extent and format by which quantitative benefits and risks should be presented.",
    "For exam- ple, Klara, et al. found a minority of DTC ads provided quantitative information about treatment benefit, and no ads provided quantitative information about risks.3 One could argue that it is not surprising they lack this information since these ads are not explicitly required to so. Additionally, FDA enforcement of rules for DTC advertising has been weakened by increased bureaucratic procedures. An example has been the reduced number of warnings issued after the Department of Health and Human Services began requiring all regulatory warnings to be reviewed by the Office of Chief Counsel.",
    "This has also led to delays that have caused regulatory warnings to be sent long after advertising campaigns have ended.1 Compounding these problems, significant staff shortages have resulted in a minority of DTC broadcasts actually being reviewed by FDA staff.1 How can we optimize the benefits of DTC advertising in empowering and engaging patients while minimizing the at- tendant risks of poor-quality DTC advertising? One option supported by the American Medical Association is banning DTC advertising.9",
    "It is notable that, outside of the US, DTC advertising is banned in all other countries except New Zealand. However, prior attempts at terminating DTC adver- tisements in the US have failed due to constitutional argu- ments that banning DTC advertisements would limit commer- cial freedom of speech.1 Others (including the authors of the accompanying article) propose boosting FDA resources to provide more prescriptive regulations on the content of infor- mation presented in DTC advertising and enforcement of such regulations.",
    "Another suggested solution is the use of an unbi- ased entity, either to review all DTC advertisements for regu- lation compliance or to actually develop and disseminate DTC information to consumers independent of pharmaceutical manufacturers. Some countries' governments have served as this unbiased entity, primarily in countries where the prescrip- tion drug system is nationalized. For example, in an effort to increase generic drug use in Portugal, the government launched a television and print advertising campaign in the 2000s promoting the prescription of generic drugs through sharing effectiveness data and economic advantages with the public.",
    "Over the course of 7 years, generic drug prescribing increased by ~ 20%.10 DTC advertising is not satisfying its goals of providing accu- rate and balanced information to patients, and is most certainly leading to increased costs for the system and for patients. In our era of rising health care costs and questionable sustainability of entitlements, one would expect the government to be more invested in delivery of high-value information to patients and providers and should consider altering its role to ensure that DTC advertising better serves its purpose.",
    "Moreover, as is evident by the issues with DTC advertising raised by the authors, the current problems with DTC advertising have resulted from a combined drift from its intended purpose and regulatory and resource limitations. Although virtually all stakeholders (including pa- tients, providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and private and public payers) are differentially affected by DTC advertising, they share a common goal of maximizing the value of drugs by delivering the right drug to the right patient at the right time. There seems to be a unique opportunity for a collective group with diverse members from the health care ecosystem to work together to devise solutions that optimize the benefits and mini- mize the risks of DTC advertising.",

    "Abstract: Environmental health literacy (EHL) involves understanding and using environmental information to make decisions about health. This study developed a validated survey instrument with four scales for assessing media-specific (i.e., air, food, water) and general EHL. The four scales were created as follows: 1) item generation: environmental health scientists and statisticians developed an initial set of items in three domains: knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors; 2) item review: items were reviewed for face validity; 3) validation: 174 public health students, the exploratory sample, and 98 community members, the test sample, validated the scales.",
    "The scales' factor structure was based on exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and model fit was assessed through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). For each scale, the final EFA resulted in an independent three-factor solution for knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors.",
    "Good fit for the three-factor structure was observed. Model fit for CFA was generally confirmed with fit indices. The scales showed internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha from 0.63 to 0.70.",
    "The 42-item instrument represents an important contribution towards assessing EHL and is designed to enable meaningful engagement between researchers and community members about environmental health. The intended outcome is sustained community-academic partnerships benefiting research design, implementation, translation, dissemination, and community action.",
    "Keywords: environmental health literacy; scale development; community-academic partnerships; water; food; air; knowledge; attitudes; behaviors 1. Introduction Environmental health literacy (EHL) refers to the understanding and use of information about potentially harmful environmental exposures and how those exposures influence health [1].",
    "EHL encompasses a range of knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors that influence how individuals and communities use environmental information in making decisions about health [2]. EHL is often viewed as a dynamic process through which individuals and communities are increasingly able to apply a more nuanced understanding of environmental health (EH) risks, exposures, outcomes, and strategies to reduce adverse environmental exposures and promote health [1,3]. Given the diversity of potential environmental exposures, it is also important to note that EHL is often specific to personal and community context and the contaminated environmental media involved.",

    "Public Health 2019, 16, 4157; doi:10.3390/ijerph16214157 www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph International Journal ofEnvironmental Researchand Public Health(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:1)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7) Int. J. Environ.",
    "Res. Public Health 2019, 16, 4157 2 of 12 media\" refers to parts of the environment, such as soil, water, air, plants and animals, that can contain contaminants, potentially resulting in individual or community exposure. EHL may be increased through multiple strategies [3].",
    "Often, the desired outcome of addressing EHL is to increase knowledge and promote action among individuals and communities, especially in situations where past exposures to hazardous substances may lead to both current and future adverse health effects [2]. Recently, the literature has emphasized the importance of information-seeking and decision- making skills that raise awareness and knowledge of EH and could result in health-protective actions [1,4-6].",
    "There is also recognition that the sources of environmental exposures are often outside an individual's control and that health disparities can heighten community concerns [7]. Furthermore, socioeconomic and contextual factors influence EHL, including language, education, community networks, and news media [3,8].",
    "Accordingly, it is necessary to address EH concerns utilizing a culturally competent, interdisciplinary, and context-specific approach [3,5,9]. Gray",
    "[1] presents three interrelated dimensions of EHL, including awareness and understanding, skills and self-efficacy to reduce harmful environmental exposures and make decisions that protect health, and community change to reduce or remove environmental exposures that are harmful to health. A range of activities are required to improve EHL across these dimensions.",
    "It is thus important to address EHL at both individual and community levels, ensuring that baseline awareness and knowledge is coupled with skills to ignite actions that promote health and reduce adverse exposure [2]. The field of EHL emerged in the 1970s from the American movements to promote literacy, including health literacy, science literacy, and environmental literacy, as well as risk communication and environmental justice [2,7].",
    "Since 2014, there have been increasing efforts to define, measure, and improve EHL [1].",
    "Some progress has been made in measuring EHL [8,10], with most studies 1) describing the perceived relationship between environmental exposures and health outcomes; 2) focusing on a specific exposure (e.g., pesticides, lead in drinking water, arsenic in soil); 3) assessing the impacts of interventions, and/or 4) examining results dissemination of biomonitoring studies [1]. For example, in a systematic literature review of 31 articles related to EHL, Gray [1] highlighted numerous studies that employed pre-/post-assessments to measure changes in EHL in response to an intervention or environmental exposure at both individual and community levels. Many of the studies utilized community-based participatory research approaches and examined community participation in results dissemination for biomonitoring studies [4,11,12].",
    "Several of these \"report-back\" studies concluded that engagement in research can advance participants' EHL [1,11,13]. A validated scale that measures individual EHL is a foundational step to improving EHL at both individual and community levels [3,14]. Standardized measurement of EHL has the potential to inform needs assessments, measure national EHL trends, guide policy and planning, and assess the impact of educational initiatives and other interventions that aim to improve EHL [3,13,14]. While several EHL tools exist, few have been validated [1].",
    "To date, there are only two peer-reviewed studies [8,10] focused on the development and validation of tools to measure EH knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes. Dixon and colleagues [8] validated the Environmental Health Engagement Profile, which examines how individuals engage with EH issues, including their experience with EH hazards, assumptions of risks, and actions taken both individually or collectively. Although this study utilized a systematic process to generate the EHL scale, it was only validated via phone with community members located in New Haven, Connecticut, and statistical analyses lacked confirmatory factor analysis.",
    "Ratnapradipa et al. [14] used a modified Delphi technique to develop and validate core EH categories and corresponding topics, creating an assessment tool with 443 potential questions.",
    "Given the number of potential items included in this scale, the researchers were unable to validate the entire survey with community members, instead receiving validation on topic-specific survey sections through focus groups [10]. Additionally, feedback from participants highlighted the difficulty of creating a general EHL survey due to the context-specific and technical nature of some EH issues, highlighting the importance of validating a general EHL scale across geographic areas.",
    "While these studies represent advancements in the field, the currently published EHL scales lack environmental Int. J. Environ. Res.",
    "Public Health 2019, 16, 4157 3 of 12 media-specific assessments of knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors and have not been validated with community members in more than one geographic area. To fill this gap, this study aims to develop a validated survey instrument to assess an individual's knowledge, attitudes and behaviors related to EHL.",
    "The design reflects the multidisciplinary nature of EH, as evidenced by the creation of scales encompassing both general EH and three environmental media; food, air, and water. These media were deliberately selected since individuals have daily contact with them and contamination of these media is often the focus of community concerns.",
    "The four scales were validated with distinct samples in two geographic areas using advanced multivariate statistical methods, including exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Using the scales in community-based participatory research (CBPR) can strengthen community engagement, research translation, and health promotion, ultimately advancing the implementation of environmental epidemiological studies.",
    "2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Item Generation A committee of six faculty and research staff from Tulane University's Department of Environmental Health Sciences and Department of Biostatistics and Data Science developed an initial set of items for the Air, Water, Food, and General EH scales. Items were generated in three domains--knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors.",
    "Knowledge was defined as facts and information pertaining to EH gained through experience or education. Attitudes were defined as settled ways of thinking or feeling about EH.",
    "Behaviors were defined as how individuals act in response to EH concerns. Items consist of declarative statements, most written in the first person, with Likert-type scales for response.",
    "Knowledge and attitude items have a five-point agreement scale of strongly agree (5), agree (4), I don't know (3), disagree (2), and strongly disagree (1). Behavior items have a five-point frequency scale of always (5), often (4), sometimes, (3), hardly ever (2), and never (1).",
    "The committee's work was informed by existing survey instruments and peer-reviewed literature related to the three environmental media and general EHL. Particular attention was paid to locating existing items that dealt with at least one of the five elements of the exposure pathway--source of exposure, environmental media and transport mechanism, point of exposure, route of exposure, and receptor population.",
    "Items were initially selected and adapted from several sources [8,10,15-20]. Each item was then categorized as knowledge, attitude, or behavior.",
    "As a group, the committee revised the list of items for a 5th grade literacy level and clear wording, discarded items with irrelevant or repeated content, developed new items, and recategorized some items by domain. Ultimately, the committee generated 126 items across the four scales, with 33 items for the Air scale, 36 items for Water, 23 items for Food, and 34 items for General EH.",
    "2.2. Item Review",
    "The items developed by the committee were then reviewed for face validity by three faculty experts [21] from Tulane University's Department of Environmental Health Sciences. The experts were not part of the committee that generated items for the scales. Each expert individually reviewed a paper or electronic copy of the scales and provided feedback in writing.",
    "Items with 100% agreement from the experts were retained, while items with less than 100% agreement were modified as suggested by the expert(s). Four new items were added.",
    "After expert review, there were a total of 130 items, with 35 items for the Air scale, 38 items for Water, 23 items for Food, and 34 items for General EH. 2.3. Scale Validation",
    "The four scales were validated through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. To conduct the factor analyses, the scales were administered to two separate samples; an exploratory sample of public health students and a test sample of community participants.",
    "Exploratory factor analysis was conducted on data collected from the public health students to identify the underlying factor structure Int. J. Environ. Res.",

Participants were administered a paper-based version of the scales that took 15-30 minutes to complete.",

    "The survey instrument uses five-point Likert scales to assess respondents' knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to EH issues. The four scales, with a total of 42 items, were developed using the results of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses completed on data collected from distinct exploratory and test samples of public health students and community members, respectively. The ten-item Air scale comprises a three-factor solution with three knowledge, three attitude, and four behavior items.",
    "All three subscales explain adequate amount of variability ranging from 13.3% to 17.6%. The Cronbach's alpha for this scale was 0.70, indicating good internal consistency.",
    "The nine-item Food scale comprises a three-factor solution with five knowledge, two attitude, and two behavior items. All three subscales explain variance ranging from 2.6% to 38.1%. The Cronbach's alpha for this scale was 0.67.",
    "The 14-item Water scale comprises a three-factor solution with five knowledge, two attitude, and two behavior items explaining 15.6-26.4% of the variance. Reliability of this scale was measured with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.63. The nine-item General EH scale also resulted in a three-factor solution with three knowledge, three attitude, and three behavior items with the subscales explaining 9.1-17.6% of the variance.",
    "The Cronbach's alpha for this scale was 0.70. Although all three factors of the four scales are distinct, they do have an implicit relationship, indicating some interdependence among them.",
    "Significant associations were found between the attitudes and knowledge subscales for all four scales. No significant associations were seen between any of the behaviors and knowledge subscales and the attitudes and behaviors subscales.",
    "All four scales show good fit statistics, with the Air scale and the General EH scale showing good absolute fit and all four scales showing good to adequate practical fit with RMSEA values ranging from 0.05 to 0.11. The validated survey instrument developed in this study represents an important contribution towards evaluating individual EH knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. The scales could be used to measure the effectiveness of a relevant intervention, however, the value of the scales does not lie in scoring or rating an individual's EHL.",
    "Rather, the scales are best utilized in CBPR settings to a) gauge community partners' general knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to EH, b) identify specific EH concerns among community partners, c) identify constraints that community partners might face in reducing adverse environmental exposures, d) inform research translation and dissemination, or e) serve as starting point for discussing EH issues and EHL among research partners. The four scales can also serve as a gap analysis to inform strategies to bolster community resilience [26] and tailor health promotion and education actions, further enabling community members to participate in both CBPR and environmental epidemiology studies.",
    "Given the complex nature of many environmental exposures, it is important that community research partners have general knowledge of the completed exposure pathway and the biological plausibility of linking adverse health conditions to environmental exposures, using appropriate and well-accepted criteria [27]. For example, to advance effective community-academic partnerships in environmental health research, there must be common understanding that environmental exposure must precede disease for there to be a possible causal relationship between the two.",
    "Using the scales as a means for researchers and community members to meaningfully engage with each other about EH and EHL will lead to more sustained community-academic partnerships and build trust in the research findings. This, in turn, will benefit research translation, dissemination, and community action.",
    "The scales will be of interest to university-based research centers (e.g., Superfund Research Program Centers, Environmental Health Sciences Core Centers) and investigators engaged in environmental epidemiology studies. In addition to expanding the EH knowledge base, the scales can also strengthen CBPR and related educational products and curricula",
    "[28]. There are some limitations for this study.",
    "The exploratory sample cannot be classified as a probability sample since data were collected from students enrolled in public health degree programs. These participants, however, were appropriate for testing knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors Int.",
    "J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019, 16, 4157 10 of 12 associated with EH.",
    "Furthermore, the factor structure developed on the exploratory sample was confirmed on a different population of community participants. Other limitations include the lack of data to test the convergent and divergent validity of the scales, and the Cronbach's alpha values of the Water scale (0.63) and the Food scale (0.67) just approach the recommended 0.70 minimum [25].",
    "The expert review of the scales for face validity likely reflected the specific expertise of the reviewers within the broad field of EH. The four scales also reflect a content-driven approach to assessing individual EHL.",
    "This approach does not necessarily assess individual self-efficacy or account for contextual drivers of EHL. However, this validated instrument does consider behaviors and attitudes in addition to knowledge, and it represents an important vehicle for community-engaged research and action that addresses other dimensions of EHL.",
    "Considering the breadth of the EH field, the scales do not cover all possible environmental media (e.g., soil) or EH issues (e.g., radon, disasters, and climate change). However, the scales can serve as a blueprint for creating more detailed scales in additional EH domains.",
    "Finally, the survey items were intentionally written at a 5th grade literacy level to ensure that the validated instrument could be effectively administered to the general public. However, reducing complex EH topics to a brief set of items necessarily involved the loss of some nuance and detail in the instrument, which is an ongoing challenge in the EHL field [29].",
    "5. Conclusions This study presents the first validated survey instrument to assess an individual's knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to EHL, contributing an important tool to environmental health research and practice. In contrast to previous EHL tools, the instrument presented in this study contains media-specific and general EH scales and was validated in its entirety with different audiences in two geographic areas through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. With only 42 items, it can be administered in a variety of community contexts and has the potential to advance the efficacy of EH interventions, build EH practice capacity, and bolster community engagement in CBPR projects.",

    "Abstract: Senior volunteering is associated with improved welfare, in addition to contributing to social development. Thus, the involvement of seniors in non-profit organizations (NPO), the third sector, or the social economy is encouraged by European national governments. At the organizational level, the situation for older volunteers in the third sector has improved in recent years, mainly due to European legal regulations.",
    "Despite a certain degree of homogenization across European countries, significant national differences persist in the adoption and promotion of volunteering. The present study examines the link between self-reported health and participation in volunteering activities among European seniors, stratified by sex and generation (the Silent Generation and the Baby Boomer Generation). We focus our analysis on seniors living in Germany, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, and Ukraine.",
    "Analyses were conducted using empirical micro data from the World Values Survey (WVS; 1994/98, 2005/09 and 2010/14). Our results demonstrate the positive impact of volunteering on health status among the elderly, although we observed marked differences in the associated benefits between sexes, generational cohorts, and countries.",
    "Public policies should be developed with this important source of social capital in mind, but should also seek to address existing inequity. Keywords: ageing; health; non-profit organizations; public policies; social economy; Sustainable Development Goals; volunteering; well-being 1.",
    "Introduction Ensuring healthy aging constitutes a major public health challenge; if the necessary measures are not taken, the resulting reversal of the population pyramid will have a huge impact on the economy, health, social development, and healthcare systems [1].",
    "Healthy aging implies that individuals not only live longer, but also live better. According to the Swedish Institute of Public Health [2], healthy aging entails optimizing opportunities for good health so that older people can participate actively in society and enjoy independence and a good quality of life.",
    "Thus, on the one hand, healthy aging promotes a reduction in health spending on medical treatments, and, on the other hand, it is associated with a greater contribution to society made by the elderly. The quality of aging depends on multiple factors, including access to and use of educational and health services, biological processes, environmental factors, and specific individual behaviors and socioeconomic characteristics",
    "[3-5]. As such, it is essential to promote health throughout the entire lifespan of individuals in order to ensure their well-being in old age [6].",
    "Sustainability 2020, 12, 2665; doi:10.3390/su12072665 www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability sustainability(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:1)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7) Sustainability 2020, 12, 2665 2 of 16 The health effects of lifestyle-related factors, including physical inactivity, a high-fat diet, and tobacco or alcohol consumption, have been well studied by the scientific community.",
    "Being socially active is also linked to health status and volunteerism. Senior volunteering is a way of being active, an opportunity to work for and with people when the roles in the work and family domains have been fulfilled [7]. Social activity helps to prevent loneliness and stress among seniors, provides social support, and enriches daily life. Being involved in social interactions, commitment to social activities, and finding social significance in life are positive social indicators that could be promoted through volunteerism",
    "[8]. The main goal of this study was to examine the socio-demographic determinants of seniors' well-being, in particular volunteering decisions. Senior volunteers may be better protected from the hazards of retirement, physical decline, and inactivity than others of the same age who do not perform volunteer work.",
    "While the positive correlation between volunteering and self-rated health is well established, questions remain regarding omitted-variable bias, self-selection, and reverse causality. While volunteering may improve self-reported health, it is also possible that those with a better self-reported health status are more likely to volunteer, or share some common characteristics with those who volunteer.",
    "We argue that the conclusions of this research are of interest for the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, specifically Goal Three: ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. We take as starting point that senior volunteering fosters healthy aging by helping volunteers to continue their personal development and to continue to contribute to their communities while retaining their autonomy and health. In this way, healthy aging promotes the building of societies that are cohesive and sustainable.",
    "We conducted an international study of the health status of European seniors and their participation in volunteering activities. In addition to including a variable indicating whether the individual is a volunteer, we classified volunteering activities into four categories, according to the focus of the activity: religion, social awareness, education- and leisure-related activities, and professional/political activities. In line with the argument that there has been a global change in people's priorities from materialistic to post-materialistic values [9], our main contribution was to describe the similarities and differences in self-reported health status and participation in volunteering activities among European seniors, taking into account sex and generational differences (the Silent Generation and the Baby Boomer Generation).",
    "Health behaviors and attitudes differ among men and women, so there are important gender gaps. In general women live longer, but men better value their state of health",
    "[10]. In addition, we also considered sub-samples of birth cohorts to analyze if characteristics or experiences shared by a group of people affect their well-being. For example, the Silent Generation may have suffered the consequences of experiencing the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) and post-war period; thus they have been exposed to higher levels of psychosocial and socioeconomic stress than Baby Boomers [11].",
    "We used data from the World Values Survey (WVS; 1994/98, 2005/09 and 2010/14), a robust instrument that provided us with a rich data set describing citizens' well-being and socio-demographic characteristics, and their participation in volunteering activities. We focused on Europe for two reasons.",
    "First, the European population is aging, and the elderly population thus represents a significant proportion of the total population. While the European population had four workers per retiree at the beginning of the millennium, this is projected to decrease to two workers per retiree by 2050 [12].",
    "Second, European governments are uniformly enacting austerity plans and spending cuts in an attempt to reduce national debts and curtail public spending. In this context, European welfare systems have to support a larger population that does not contribute economically, or contributes in ways that are not reflected in national accounts. Lifestyles, including volunteering, affect our health.",
    "The statutory minimum retirement age is relatively homogeneous throughout countries of the EU. It is thus interesting to assess the geographical differences between these countries, which reflect the attempts of different welfare systems to implement effective social policies.",
    "In this context, volunteerism represents a productive contribution to society [13]. Sustainability 2020, 12, 2665 3 of 16 Moreover, the theory of continuity [14] explains that employee volunteering [15] can be a predictor of volunteering activity in retirement.",
    "In general, the authors identify a set of models that relate different types of non-governmental organizations to different types of welfare systems [16].",
    "However, after the outbreak of the 2008 global economic crisis, [17] it was pointed out that states should be left aside for the analysis of civic participation. Civic participation might be better explained as a response to globalization, and it has been a much more inspiring force within the global context than within national territories.",
    "There are various factors that contribute to this, such as countries' participation in international institutions [18] and the advancement of information technology [19]. As a consequence, countries show more homogenized patterns in volunteering which lead to a growing isomorphism in a global civil society around the world.",
    "2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Literature Review Volunteering is an important element of civil society all over the world [20].",
    "Volunteering can be defined as the organized performance in which time is given freely to benefit another person, group, organization, or society as a whole [21]. Volunteering must be a free choice, unpaid, aim to help others, and carried out through an organizational framework [22]. Following the theory of human capital [23], volunteering promotes the development of certain skills and experience.",
    "These skills could ease labor market access or other additional returns [24-26]. However, volunteers are basically perceived as altruistic individuals who offer their economic resources to meet other people's needs. Voluntary work includes acts of solidarity and public benefit, and commitments to the environment and to social welfare.",
    "However, the reality may be more complex. Participation in the social economy through non-profit organizations (NPO) generates social benefits, in that NPO members interchange ideas, transfer knowledge, generate interpersonal trust and encourage political involvement, and raise human capital in other ways [27]. Cooperation through volunteering in NPOs is a viable and sustainable solution that benefits all involved, including the volunteers themselves [28-30].",
    "For example, by sharing their professional experience, retirees can help those who are beginning their careers, while at the same time benefitting personally from a feeling of usefulness within their communities. The theory of activity proposes that after retirement seniors attempt to replace their former job with volunteering work as a means of maintaining a positive sense of themselves [31,32].",
    "Volunteering can play a particularly important role among the elderly by helping to protect them against the hazards of retirement, physical decline, and inactivity. Moreover, volunteering may help prevent social isolation, which is a major risk factor in mortality from a wide variety of causes. Through increased social engagement, volunteering may provide a protective mental health benefit in older adults, particularly women [33,34].",
    "Some studies have shown that volunteers self-report a better health status than non-volunteers [35-41]. In longitudinal studies, volunteering is associated with various indicators of well-being, including a reduction in mortality and depressive symptoms and an improvement in physical function, self-reported health, and life satisfaction [42]. Even in senior citizens with multiple chronic diseases, participating in volunteer activities may improve self-reported health status [43] in general, and psychological health, physical health, and longevity [44] in particular.",
    "Health status in the elderly has been measured using a wide variety of indicators, including depressive symptoms [8], the Index of Competence [45], independent instrumental activities of daily living [46], physical activity, resting heart rate, blood pressure [47], and a predictor of tooth retention in later life",
    "[48]. Recent research suggests that participating in volunteer activities during leisure time has a positive reinforcing effect on both health and happiness [49-51]. Furthermore, the positive social effects of Sustainability 2020, 12, 2665 4 of 16 volunteering activities in the elderly persist up to two years after the social capital interventions [8].",
    "In fact, volunteering by seniors could be highly beneficial for societies with large aging populations. Most seniors participate in volunteering activities only after having been asked, whereas a smaller proportion actively seeks volunteering opportunities [52].",
    "As such, the impetus driving volunteerism may be relevant to inferring individual characteristics that encourage certain behaviors. In addition to promoting volunteering decisions, certain personality traits, such as extraversion, contribute to life satisfaction",
    "[53]. Furthermore, many employees acquire volunteering experience through corporate social responsibility initiatives, which further encourage volunteering in retirement [15,54]. Social relations are important in themselves. However, to analyze their possible instrumental value, it is essential to discern whether these relationships are perceived as \"satisfactory\" or not.",
    "Processes and networks of mutual assistance, the dissemination of health-related information, and the promotion of healthy behaviors are only effective in the context of high-quality relationships [55]. Different types of volunteering activities require distinct volunteer profiles. In our research we have classified volunteering activities in four categories: Social Awareness, Profession & Politics, Education & Leisure, and Religion. The type of volunteering activity can have different effects on those involved [56]. Volunteering in a professional organization is not the same as volunteering in a religious group [57].",
    "Moreover, participation in different types of NGOs has different effects on the capabilities of their members and different benefits to society [58]. Associations can be instrumental or expressive in character.",
    "In general, voluntary organizations with an expressive character promote the development of more homogeneous networks, while those of an instrumental character tend to promote the development of more heterogeneous contacts [59]. Voluntary organizations of an instrumental character are positively associated with political participation",
    "[58], as instrumental participation involves the pursuit of goals outside of the group. In this scenario, volunteering involves more than enjoying the social aspect of the activity and the opportunity to participate; volunteers have a certain social vocation that drives them to influence public behavior in accordance with certain values or social norms. By contrast, voluntary organizations of an expressive character exist primarily to allow their members to express themselves and fulfill their needs, and are more homogeneous in their composition and goals [60].",
    "These organizations provide entertainment and appear to have a shorter-lived impact on the attitudes of their members [60,61]. Finally, who we are and where we live has a profound effect on our well-being [62].",
    "It is important to consider the issue of diversity in health [63], and, in particular, to advocate for effective international policies on equity and human rights.",
    "The effect of social relationships and support networks on the well-being of men and women depends on a variety of demographic and environmental factors including age, socioeconomic status, and residence in an urban or rural environment [64]. Similarly, national differences in volunteering may be linked to differences in economic background, religious traditions, political systems, and/or democratic stability [65]. Both structural factors and cultural determinants may influence volunteering decisions [66,67].",
    "2.2. Data Base and Descriptive Statistics",
    "The World Values Survey constitutes a powerful tool for the study of the socioeconomic determinants of well-being. While seven waves of this survey have been conducted to date, only data pertaining to the last three waves (1994/98, 2005/09 and 2010/14) were used in the present study. Restricting the empirical analysis to these three waves ensured that the questions included in the questionnaires were comparable over time.",
    "Our analysis focused on senior citizens aged from 51 to 70 years old from Germany, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, and Ukraine. In Europe, as in most developed countries around the world, the chronological age of 65 years has been recently accepted as the definition of an older person [68]. However, the aging process is, of course, a biological reality which has its own dynamic.",
    "It is very difficult to introduce a habit, whatever it may be, in the third age, and is necessary to promote it in previous vital stages. To approach aging as a process requires awareness along the life span, and that is the main reason that observations of Sustainability 2020, 12, 2665 5 of 16 citizens aged 51 to 70 years old have been selected.",
    "As a positive externality, this criterion allows for comparison between two generations: the Silent Generation and Baby Boomers. Sex and generational differences were taken into account by considering four subsamples stratified by sex (men and women) and by generational cohort (the Silent Generation, born between 1925 and 1949; and the Baby Boomer Generation, born between 1950 and 1965)",
    "[69]. Health was measured based on the self-reported health status, scored on a scale of 1 (excellent) to 5 (very poor). We also constructed a dummy variable (Health) for these categories, whereby 1 indicates that the individual self-reported an excellent or very good health status, and 0 indicates otherwise.",
    "Active membership of any non-profit organization was taken as an indicator of volunteering. The WVS considers voluntary participation in 11 different volunteer activities. For simplicity, we classified voluntary work into four groups [70]: (1) Social Awareness: activities related to human rights or environmental and animal conservation; (2) Profession & Politics: activities related to unions, political parties, and professional associations; (3) Education & Leisure: activities related to education, culture, youth work, sports, or leisure; (4) Religion: activities related to churches or religious organizations.",
    "Volunteers working on issues relating to social awareness and religion could have other-oriented motivations (extrinsic motivations), while those working on issues related to professions and leisure activities could be driven by motivations centered on the self (intrinsic motivations). We created one general dummy variable, UW(All Categories), and four dummy variables, one for each category: UW(Social Awareness), UW(Politics & Profession), UW(Leisure & Education), and UW(Religion).",
    "Figure 1 depicts the self-reported health status and rate of volunteering for senior citizens from 1994-98 to 2010-14. Those that reported the highest rate of good health were male respondents to the 1994-98 survey belonging to the Baby Boomer Generation, 56% of which self-reported good health. By contrast, female respondents to the 1994-98 survey belonging to the Silent Generation had the lowest rate of self-reported good health, at 25%.",
    "As expected, men and Baby Boomers self-reported a better health status than women and those belonging to the Silent Generation. Nevertheless, for both men and women, the proportion of people from the Silent Generation self-reporting a good health status was approximately 10 percentage points higher in 2010-14 versus 1994-98. The proportion of female Baby Boomers who self-reported a good health status remained constant over time, while the corresponding proportion of males decreased by around 5 percentage points between 2005-09 and 2010-14.",
    "Women from the Silent Generation were the least likely to volunteer (21% in the 1994-98 survey), while men from the Baby Boomer Generation were the most likely (40% in the 1994-98 survey). Volunteering rates remained constant for the Silent Generation and decreased for Baby Boomers. In fact, the most recently recorded volunteering rates for Baby Boomers were similar to those of the Silent Generation cohort.",
    "As shown in Figure 2, Sweden had the highest rate of seniors with self-reported good health (~75%) and the highest rates of volunteering (~50%). By contrast, Ukraine had the lowest rate of seniors with a self-reported good health (<25%) and one of the lowest volunteering rates (~10%). However, assuming a direct correlation between self-reported health and volunteering may be misleading: Spain and Turkey both showed high rates of self-reported health but low rates of volunteering.",
    "Table 1 shows the population distribution according to dependent and explanatory variables. As shown in Figure 1, men and Baby Boomers reported a better health status than women and those from the Silent Generation cohort. Significant sex and generational differences were observed. Women were less likely to volunteer than men, particularly for activities related to politics and professions.",
    "Sex differences were less pronounced in the Baby Boomer Generation cohort. In the Silent Generation cohort, the percentage of married individuals was higher for men than women. This could be explained by the higher percentage of widows versus widowers in that generational cohort. The comparison of generational cohorts revealed a markedly higher percentage of divorcees in the Baby Boomer Generation versus the Silent Generation cohort. The analysis of the employment situation and educational level revealed that men reported higher rates of work and a higher level of education, although these differences were less pronounced in the Baby Boomer cohort.",

    "(Total number of observations: 10,271.) 2.3. Multilevel Modeling The main objective of this project was to analyze potential determinants, including volunteering activities, of self-reported health among European seniors. To this end, we used modeling and econometric estimation techniques to evaluate the relationship between volunteering and the Sustainability 2020, 12, 2665 8 of 16 self-reported health status in this population.",
    "The models and estimation techniques used were selected depending on the nature of the data to be analyzed (cross-sectional) and the desired reads-outs (estimated probabilities). We used a Simple Logits model (reporting results in terms of elasticities) to understand the influence of socioeconomic characteristics and volunteering decisions on the health status of European seniors: Hi = b 0 + b 1Xi + b 2UWi + b 3Countryi + b 2SurveyYeari + e1i 1i). We considered two models.",
    "The health status of individual ith (Hi) depends on socioeconomic factors (Xi), volunteering decisions (UWi), country of residence (Countryi), year of survey (SurveyYeari), and a set of unobserved variables summarized in a zero-mean error term (e In Model 1 UWi we included UW(All Categories), whereas in Model 2 UWi we included UW(Social Awareness), UW(Politics & Profession), UW(Leisure & Education) and UW(Religion). We repeated the analysis four times for the sex and generational subsamples (women from the Silent Generation, women from the Baby Boomer Generation, men from the Silent Generation, and men from the Baby Boomer Generation) to identify differences between estimated parameters that would in turn reveal sex and generational gaps. In these models, the key parameter for our research was b 2, which provides information on the causal effect of volunteering decisions on health status, controlling for differences in the observed and unobserved determinants of (Hi).",
    "Finally, we conducted a Smith-Blundell exogeneity test to determine whether volunteering decisions constituted independent variables. If any explanatory variable was simultaneously explained by the model that defines the dependent variable, this could indicate a problem of endogeneity, which in turn could bias the results. Given that the structure of our data is cross-sectional, endogeneity problems could lead to estimations that erroneously suggest correlation effects, instead of causal effects.",
    "For Model 1, the test confirmed that UW(All Categories) was an endogenous explanatory variable of health status for women of the Baby Boomer Generation cohort (the coefficient of the residual of volunteering in the estimation of health status equaled -10.707, with a z-statistic of -3.23) and for men from the Silent Generation cohort (the coefficient of the residual of volunteering in the estimation of health status equaled -11.903, with a z-statistic of -3.78). There was no empirical evidence of endogeneity for Model 2. Given that the magnitude of the estimated parameters of volunteering activities was not particularly high and the other estimated parameters remained robust across models, we decided to keep the empirical strategy as simple as possible.",
    "3. Results For both male and female seniors, living in an eastern European country was associated with a poorer health status and reduced engagement in volunteering activities as compared with counterparts living in Sweden (the country of reference). Table 2 shows the results of the analysis of the role of volunteering as a determinant of health status in European women.",
    "The results of the Smith-Blundell exogeneity test indicate that the relationship between volunteering and health status in women may represent a correlative rather than a causal association (Model 1) for women of the Baby Boomer Generation. However, for women of the Silent Generation cohort, the positive effect of volunteering, and in particular volunteering in leisure- and education-related activities, was robust (Model 2).",
    "Among women of the Silent Generation, divorced and single women were more likely to enjoy good health than married women. Employment, education, and income level were all relevant determinants of good health.",

    "4. Discussion The increasing importance of the third sector in the economy underscores the need for more specific research to explore its role and its consequences.",
    "In the present study, we focused on determinants of self-reported health and participation in volunteering activities. Our findings suggest a positive impact of volunteering, particularly in leisure- and education-related activities, on health status in seniors.",
    "Indeed, our results, obtained using data for European countries from the World Values Survey, revealed that the country with the highest rates of volunteering also had the highest rates of good health (Sweden), while the countries with the lowest rates of volunteering had the lowest rates of good health (eastern European countries). Both volunteering and health are affected by a variety of factors, and causality should not be taken for granted.",
    "Further research will be required to further explore this issue, taking into consideration the specific effects of different types of volunteering activities [46], the number and frequency of social activities [71], the position of the individual in NPOs [72], and attitudes towards volunteering [47].",
    "However, both formal and informal volunteering [73] have been shown to increase social connectedness and broaden social networks, with a resulting protective effect on mental and physical health [74]. The exposed subject has many perspectives, all of them important.",
    "However, in order to answer a research question, the best approach is to focus on a specific point in order to isolate causes and consequences. However, from the point of view of both individual well-being and national welfare systems, many variables are left out of the scope of research.",
    "For example, volunteering in activities related to human rights might improve a senior's life satisfaction but reduce their happiness [75]. In this research, we focus on perceived health because it is the first proxy to value individual health and the access and use of health services and products [76].",
    "Designing strategies to promote volunteering among older people requires prior knowledge of the characteristics of that population. The main conclusion that we can draw from our results is that policy-makers should take into account the socioeconomic characteristics of seniors when seeking to design effective policies; for example, improving individual working conditions promotes participation in volunteering activities and improves well-being. While the generation of economic growth is important, it is equally important to promote economic development that helps improve the lives of citizens [77].",
    "In fact, we found that education level and income are key factors influencing the volunteering activity and well-being of seniors. The profile of the senior volunteer is an individual of less than 75 years of age, with good health, who has a high level of education and has achieved a high socioeconomic status [78]. Sex and generational cohort appeared to affect the intensity, but not the overall effect, of socioeconomic factors on volunteering activity [72]. For example, due to changing cultural contexts, the youth experiences of women of the Silent Generation cohort will have differed to those of male counterparts, and to those of women of the subsequent Baby Boomer Generation.",
    "Finally, academic literature suggests that participation in volunteering activities may benefit the health of the volunteer [79].",
    "While participating in volunteering activities generates multiple benefits for all involved, some seniors may not participate in volunteering activities simply due to ignorance. According to the theory of continuity [14], and within the framework of corporate social responsibility, employee volunteerism promotes continued volunteering by retired seniors at non-profit organizations with which they are already familiar [15]. This information can be very useful in developing a political agenda that promotes health and well-being [80].",
    "Moreover, messages about the positive effects of volunteering on society and on volunteers themselves should be reinforced [55]. Volunteering should be recognized as an element crucial for social cohesion, and should be afforded greater visibility in Sustainability 2020, 12, 2665 12 of 16 society [81]. Moreover, given the synergy between social cooperation and well-being, volunteering should be recognized and promoted [82].",
    "In short, volunteering by the elderly constitutes an important resource for the community by, for example, promoting entrepreneurship among the youngest or caring for the most vulnerable older people [47]. Our findings, in agreement with those of other authors, suggest that existing barriers should be removed to facilitate and encourage the participation of seniors in both formal and informal volunteering activities",
    "[83,84]. As social researchers, a commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals implies the responsibility to provide empirical evidence that supports policies across all sectors that empower older persons. Active aging transcends healthcare.",
    "Senior volunteering allows our elders to feel valued as citizens by working generously in their communities. As limitations of this research, we highlight four main issues. First, we do not take into account public and private resources that promote volunteering, or even the volunteering contributions to improve citizens' well-being. The economic relevance of the non-profit sector has long remained invisible, given the lack of data.",
    "In recent years, some effort has been made to obtain more information on volunteering, mainly fostered by researchers, but increasingly encouraged by governments. Although volunteering has no market price, volunteering has an important economic value [85].",
    "Second, it is important to control for how countries and their welfare systems determine the action of voluntary organizations, but also to take into account than non-profit organizations are becoming global at the same time as they remain conditioned by domestic public policies [86]. For this reason, the role of global civil society in senior volunteering should be addressed in future research [87]. Third, there are important differences among welfare systems in issues related to gender differences and volunteering activities. For example, for senior women in southern Europe, if they engage in volunteering activities, they engage in religious organizations that do not carry out voluntary activities, and, in most cases, they are linked to religious organizations [4].",
    "Four, in-depth interviews and discourse analysis are qualitative methodologies which complement empirical quantitative approaches [88]. This type of analysis can provide further details on the variety of meanings that older people give to their participation in volunteer organizations and better understand the nature of their decision-making process.",

    "This paper employed a thematic analysis to assess policy consultation submissions made to a government inquiry regarding use and marketing of NVPs. We included in the analysis submissions (n = 40) made by Australian institutions that influence or contribute to health policy-making including government agencies, health bodies and charities (n = 23), and public health academics and healthcare professionals (n = 18). Submissions from commercial entities and consumers were excluded.",
    "The majority of submissions from representatives of government agencies, health bodies and charities recommended maintaining current restrictions on NVPs. Arguments against widening access to NVPs included the demand for long-term evidence on safety and efficacy of an unusually high standard. There was widespread support for restrictions on sales, advertising and promotion, with most submissions supporting similar controls as for tobacco products.",
    "In contrast, the majority of individual submissions from healthcare professionals and public health academics advocated for widening access to NVPs for smokers and emphasized the potential benefits of smokers switching to vaping and the policy incoherence of regulating less harmful nicotine products more strictly than tobacco cigarettes. Progress in resolving the policy debate concerning NVP regulation in Australia will require policy makers, clinicians and the public health community to engage in a meaningful dialogue which gives due consideration to both intended and unintended consequences of proposed policies.",

Introduction Since their introduction into the market in the mid-2000s, the use of nicotine vaping products (NVPs) (also known as e-cigarettes or electronic nicotine delivery systems) has increased rapidly [1-4]. These products have now become more popular than nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) for smoking cessation in some countries such as the UK [5]. Yet, there has been continued debate over the most appropriate regulatory framework for these products and whether their use should be encouraged for harm reduction purposes, with profoundly divergent standpoints evident in the public health field",

In the UK, a dual regulatory pathway exists for NVPs as either a medicine or a consumer product under the EU Tobacco Product Directive (TPD)",
    "[8]. Similarly, NVPs can be marketed as either medicines, if health claims are made, or tobacco products in New Zealand following the outcome of a court case in 2018.",
    "Australia, on the other hand, has maintained a highly restrictive regulatory framework for NVPs. Most jurisdictions in Australia allow nicotine-free vaping products to be used and sold under similar conditions as imposed on combustible cigarettes [9].",
    "Nicotine in non-therapeutic products is classified by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA)'s Poisons Standard as a dangerous poison (Schedule 7). Nicotine in preparations for human therapeutic use are either an unscheduled medicine (can be sold in general retail outlets) when in oromucosal and transdermal delivery systems for smoking cessation, or a prescription only medicine (Schedule 4) for all other human therapeutic products Combustible tobacco products are exempt from scheduling [10]. As a result, the only way for Australians to access NVPs containing nicotine is for therapeutic purposes with a medical prescription (Schedule 4 medicine).",
    "However, since there are no NVPs registered in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, NVPs can only be obtained through personal importation of up to three months' supply from overseas, the Special Access Scheme, the Authorized Prescriber Scheme, or through extemporaneous compounding [11]. All of these pathways require the person to hold a valid prescription from a medical practitioner registered in Australia.",
    "There have been a number of government inquiries and unsuccessful attempts to liberalize the regulation of NVPs in Australia. These include a 2016 application from a consumer organization to the TGA to \"exempt nicotine from Schedule 7 at concentrations of 3.6 per cent or less of nicotine for self-administration with an electronic nicotine delivery system for the purpose of tobacco harm reduction\" [12], a Senate inquiry ('Red Tape Committee', October 2016) that examined the impact of government regulation on tobacco retailing including NVP marketing in Australia [13], and a Senate inquiry into the Vaporized Nicotine Products Bill (August 2017)",
    "[14], which was tabled by federal cross-bench senators. Most recently, the 2017 House of Representatives Inquiry Into the Use and Marketing of E-cigarettes and Personal Vaporizers in Australia [15] has been completed and the final report published. For decades, the public health community across the globe have coalesced around a shared policy priority of ending the tobacco epidemic, and successfully advocated for adopting strong tobacco control policies.",
    "However, profoundly divergent standpoints are evident in the public health field when it comes to NVPs. A recent analysis of health policy positions in Scotland regarding NVP regulation found that although most policy actors agreed on some policy issues, such as age-of-sale restrictions, they were divided with regard to the harms and benefits of NVPs and on the most appropriate regulatory framework",
    "[16]. However, how the public health community in Australia have framed the NVP-related policy debate has not been systematically explored. In this study, we analyzed written submissions to and the transcripts of public hearings of the 2017 House of Representatives Inquiry from government health agencies, health charities, individual healthcare professionals (HCPs), public health academics, and organizations representing health and medical professionals (peak health bodies) with the following research questions: (1) What are the views of medical and health organizations, HCPs and public health academics regarding the safety and efficacy of NVPs?",
    "(2) What are the policy frameworks and preferred regulatory options that have been recommended by these organizations and individuals and what are the discourses used to describe them? (3) In what ways has the framing of scientific evidence about these products been used to justify the proposed regulations? 2.

The Inquiry received 352 submissions from government and non-government organizations, academics, individual health care professionals, for profit businesses (including the tobacco industry), as well as members of the public.

    "First, line by line reading of the submissions and interview transcripts was performed to establish familiarity with the data. Guided by our research aims, a set of pre-specified codes were then generated which were merged into a higher level 'themes' based on similarity, representing a broader topic. In addition, an inductive approach was employed to identify new and emergent themes as we coded the data.",
    "In order to ensure validity and transparency, a second author (K.M.) independently coded a subset of submissions and generated codes. As the coding and analysis progressed, the themes were compared and cross-examined between the two coders. Any disagreements between the coders were addressed through discussion and consensus.",
    "Coding was managed with NVivo 12 software (QSR International Pty Ltd, Melbourne, Australia). 3. Results A total of 40 submissions were included in the analysis: nine from government bodies, seven from peak health bodies, seven from health charities, and 18 from individual HCPs and public health academics. These ranged from two to 16 pages in length. In addition, 19 of the submissions were supplemented with interview transcripts from the public hearing (Table 1).",
    "An overwhelming majority of HCPs and public health academics who made individual submissions (83%) endorsed the role of NVPs as a smoking cessation and/or harm reduction tool. In contrast, of the submissions from government and peak health bodies, 20 (91%) recommended against relaxing current restrictions until more evidence on efficacy and long term safety is available. Only one peak health body, the RANZCP, endorsed NVPs as a tool for harm reduction. There were commonalities among government agencies, peak health bodies and health charities in the way the problem was framed and understood, which we discussed in detail below.",
    "3.1. Thresholds Two main themes were identified in relation to thresholds: (1) the level and credibility of evidence that is needed to support changing current policy, and (2) the level of risk associated with NVPs that is considered to be acceptable. 3.2.",
    "Acceptable Level and Credibility of Evidence The analyses of the submissions and public hearing transcripts revealed that the policy debates and recommendations centered on the lack of consensus regarding the current scientific evidence, and to some extent, differential interpretation of this evidence. Nearly all government and peak health bodies discussed the importance of evidence-based policy making and asserted that their policy positions were based on the current scientific literature. Those who recommended against relaxing current restrictions often cited statements from the NHMRC and WHO that advocate the principle of keeping NVPs off the market until their efficacy and long term safety profile are well established.",
    "\"The World Health Organization (WHO) does not currently consider e-cigarettes to be a legitimate tobacco cessation therapy.\" Australian Council on Smoking and Health (Written submission 285) At times, the PHE evidence review was cited by those who advocated for a 'precautionary approach' but only to criticize and/or discredit the '95% safer than smoking' conclusion, claiming that the procedures followed to reach the conclusion were unscientific. \"Claims that e-cigarettes are \"95% safer\" than tobacco smoke, however, are unfounded and devoid of any scientific basis.\"",

    "While the statement that \"further research is needed\" was common, and many stated that they would support the use of NVPs in the future if they are proven to be safe and effective, most did not elaborate on what level of safety and effectiveness, or what type of evidence would provide sufficient proof. The Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand (TSANZ) indicated in the public hearings that an evidence threshold of greater than 10 years of epidemiological data was required. \"Chronic respiratory conditions can take many years to become symptomatic.",
    "It is therefore important studies the track health impacts over the long term, by which we mean greater than 10 years\". Professor Bruce Thompson (TSANZ) (public hearing; 5 October 2017; page 1) Another finding was the inconsistent use of anecdotal evidence.",
    "Case reports, social media stories and personal experiences that reported nicotine poisoning and battery explosions were cited as evidence that NVPs posed an unacceptable risk. However, similar anecdotal experiences of smokers who successfully quit smoking by switching to vaping were depicted as unreliable, and it was argued that they should not be taken into consideration in the policy making process. \"I also want to briefly highlight the safety concerns about batteries used in e-cigarettes, with reports of these devices exploding and causing quite serious injuries.\"",

    "Acceptable Level of Risk Discussion about safety by most health organizations and government bodies emphasized the absolute safety that comes from abstinence rather than reducing harm via substituting smoking with a less harmful product. In this regard, the acceptable level of safety of NVPs was framed by the absolute term 'safe', rather than the relative term 'safer'. For example, when asked about the threshold at which safety of NVPs would become acceptable, the AMA's Dr Bartone said \"I'm not going to be tied to a number other than 100 per cent\" (public hearing; 5 October 2017; page 12)",

    "None of the health organizations or government health bodies argued that vaping is more harmful than smoking, but making combustible cigarettes a point of reference against which the safety of other nicotine containing products are compared was portrayed as inappropriate. The discussion hinged on the potential harms relative to abstinence, and the difficulty of inferring the degree of harm reduction that could be achieved from switching between products based on the current scientific evidence. \"While e-cigarettes may expose users to fewer toxic chemicals than, say, a tobacco cigarette, the extent to which it reduces harm has actually not been determined by the evidence.\"",

    "Policy Coherence Many organizations stated that Australia's current regulatory approach to nicotine and NVPs is underpinned by various national and international health policy frameworks (such as the National Drug Strategy 2017-2026, the National Tobacco Strategy 2012-2018 and the WHO FCTC) and takes Australia's national circumstances into consideration, particularly the significant gains made in reducing smoking rates. It was argued that maintaining current restrictions on nicotine was consistent with Australia's 'harm minimization' principle. They argued that advocates of NVPs focused only on one of the pillars (harm reduction) of harm minimization, while rejecting the other two important pillars (demand and supply reduction).",
    "\"Many advocates of e-cigarettes as a harm reduction approach seem to wish to disregard the other important pillars that ensure the minimizing of harm. Supply reduction principles would support regulation of supply to limit the availability of e-cigarettes\" Public Health Association of Australia (Written Submission 301)",

    "Cancer Council Australia (CCA) and National Heart Foundation of Australia (Written submission 295) In contrast, other submissions asserted that the current regulatory framework governing NVPs is incoherent in that it exempts tobacco cigarettes, the most dangerous nicotine delivery system, from the same controls that are being applied to NVPs containing nicotine. The current policy was also described as more restrictive than medical use of cannabis, an internationally controlled substance. \"We are treating them much like we do heroin. It's a much more restrictive policy towards nicotine products, for example, than medical cannabis, which the TGA is regulating in a much more liberal way at the moment, in the absence of evidence of efficacy.\" Professor Wayne Hall (public hearing; 8 September 2017' page 7)",

    "Public Health 2019, 16, 4555 9 of 18 3.6. Maintaining the Status Quo: The Precautionary Approach The majority of peak health organizations and government bodies described the current regulatory controls as a \"precautionary approach\" or as following the \"precautionary principle\". This terminology was used in submissions from all government health bodies.",
    "Many policy actors (including health charities such as NHFA and ACOSH) also endorsed and/or referred to statements made by organizations that reference the precautionary principle/approach (such as NHMRC) or followed a regulatory approach with a similar sentiment to the precautionary principle (for instance, the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons and VicHealth). \"Only once safety and efficacy has been thoroughly established should consideration about changing regulatory approaches take place\".",
    "AMA (Written submission 289) The term 'precautionary' was frequently used, but there appeared to be variations in what this meant in practical terms for NVP regulation.",
    "The first and most common variation of this approach was that the introduction of any new product that carries unknown but potentially harmful effects should be prohibited until the potential harms of the product, and their efficacy, is established with adequate evidence. Those who advocated for a precautionary approach reiterated the notion that any change to the status quo should only be considered after it is determined, with sufficient certainty, that NVPs can help people quit and also that they are 'safe'. \"The longitudinal research that is required to establish safety will take time, but until more definitive evidence on safety becomes available the precautionary principle should be applied to these products\".",
    "AMA (Written submission 289) As described above, some believed that adequate evidence would not become available for decades, and some suggested that the evidence had to show zero harm. The burden of proof that it is safe and effective was argued to fall to NVP advocates and manufacturers who want to see a change in the current regulatory landscape. \"If there is a suspected risk of harm and the scientific information is lacking, such that there is an absence of scientific consensus, then the burden of proof that it is not harmful falls on those wanting to progress the issue\".",
    "TSANZ and Lung Foundation (written submission 332) The second argument in favor of adopting a \"precautionary approach\" was that using nicotine in any form (be it in cigarettes or NVPs) other than approved nicotine replacements (NRTs) was extremely dangerous and addictive.",
    "It was stated that NRTs do not predispose or worsen users' addiction to nicotine (due to non-addictive concentrations and slower release of nicotine) and they are not being taken up by non-smokers even though they are available in general retail outlets. The distinctive feature of NVPs, however, posed an 'increased risk' for users, by sustaining addiction to nicotine and potentially deterring them from quitting altogether, i.e., becoming long-term dual use of cigarettes and NVPs. \"E-cigarettes may result in some smokers delaying their decision to quit, as people may feasibly move between e-cigarettes and tobacco smoking, as their desire to quit varies over time.\"",
    "AMA (Written submission 289) \"What the patches and gums do is provide a low-level sustained response.",
    "Why e-cigarettes are indeed popular is that, in the same way a heroin injection gives a hit, you get a large amount of nicotine coming into the system. It gives you a nicotine hit. That's why there is a risk of diversion, use--call it what you want--for non-smoking cessation purposes.\"",

    "Therapeutic Products Regulation: Medicinal Licensing and Prescription Access Part of the policy debate hinged on whether or not NVPs should continue to be regulated as a medicine due to the implications for licensing, production and supply. Those who opposed relaxing current restrictions asserted that any nicotine-containing products that are inhaled directly into the lungs, be it inhalers or NVPs, should be regulated as prescription medicines and that they should be assessed, approved and regulated by the TGA regardless of the claims made (smoking cessation or harm reduction). ACOSH's submission emphasized that \"no action should be taken that in any way pre-empts the role of the TGA\" (Written Submission 285, page 2).",
    "It was reiterated that any product with a harm reduction claim should go through TGA approval process regardless of its potential benefit in helping smokers quit because 'they are being framed as a health argument' (Mr Michael Moore [PHAA]; public hearing; 5 October 2017; page 17). It was argued that unless they are approved by the TGA as a cessation aid, NVPs should neither be marketed, nor legally available as quit aids. TGA approval and prescription only access was described as a 'sensible harm-reduction approach' (Professor Bruce Thompson",
    "[TSANZ]; public hearing; 5 October 2017; page 2) and advocated as a solution to avoid children taking up NVPs and eventually transferring to smoking. The TGA also cited potential benefits of the current approach.",
    "It was argued that making NVPs available only on prescription would benefit priority populations as these patients could use routine GP visits to collect their vaping products alongside other medications. If approved vaping products were listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, this would make them available at 'concessional rates'. The current legal framework allows smokers to legally access nicotine e-liquid either through TGA exemptions (personal importation, the Special Access Scheme, Authorized Prescriber Scheme) or through extemporaneous compounding.",
    "These legal pathways all require the person to hold a valid medical prescription. Yet, there appeared to be misunderstanding of the Commonwealth law among some government health bodies and health charities.",
    "For instance, RACGP argued that due to the extensive and 'onerous' procedure of writing a prescription for nicotine under the current regulatory arrangements, GPs would be less likely to engage in such process, and this would 'make it extremely difficult for people who want to get access to some form of nicotine and import it' Associate Professor John Litt [RACGP]; public hearing; 5 October 2017; page 20). However, while the Special Access and Authorized Prescriber Schemes do involve considerable additional paperwork for prescribers, the personal importation and extemporaneous compounding options do not require any special paperwork beyond a prescription.",
    "The issue of biomedicalization of smoking cessation as it relates to NVPs and medicinal regulation was also discussed by the RANZCP. It was noted that smokers may not opt to use prescription medications for smoking cessation since smoking is not widely seen as a medical issue. This suggested that the therapeutic goods framework was not appropriate if NVPs were viewed by smokers as being in the same category as cigarettes, since this would exclude some who may benefit from wider access outside a therapeutic framing. 3.8.",
    "Consumer Product Regulation: A Risk Proportionate Regulatory Model While the potential for NVPs to be a cessation tool was acknowledged by some, the risk of marketing these products as a consumer product was described as unacceptable due to the perceived potential risks of these products prevailing over the unproven health claims. Others argued that treating NVPs as a consumer product is 'harm escalation' rather than 'harm reduction', presumably because the products would primarily be used for purposes other than quitting smoking if not regulated as therapeutic goods. The RANZCP was the only peak health body represented in the submissions and hearings that advocated for regulating NVPs as a consumer product. To reconcile the benefit of using NVPs for priority populations (such as those with mental illness) with the potential risk of young people taking up smoking, the RANZCP suggested following a risk proportionate regulatory model that would discourage use of smoked tobacco products, and allow appropriate access to NVPs among smokers while discouraging access to and use by adolescents.",

    "Public Health 2019, 16, 4555 11 of 18 tobacco products disregards the differential risks associated with vaping and smoking while subjecting them to TGA processes (medicinal licensing) would heavily hinder access to these products. Thus, regulating NVPs as consumer products was viewed by RANZCP as an appropriate policy response. A number of submissions from HCPs and public health academics also reinforced the notion that NVPs should be seen as a consumer product (not as a clinical intervention) and regulated as such, but within a fairly restrictive and risk proportionate manner. Moreover, RANZCP advocated for applying differential taxes for differential risks.",
    "As such, NVPs would be taxed at a much lower rate than conventional cigarettes to promote switching. \"The continuing harms to disadvantaged groups reduced most quickly, if two additional sets of strategies are integrated into the existing mix: namely, regulating smoked tobacco more stringently, and differentially regulating (including pricing) lower harm smokeless nicotine and tobacco products to make switching to these products a more viable option for those unwilling or unable to quit nicotine use completely.\" Professor Ron Borland (written submission 216) \"Keeping e-cigarettes and vaporizers at a low cost would not only encourage uptake of these devices over more harmful products but would also present financial benefits for vulnerable groups.\"",

    "Promotion and Advertising It was argued that the current promotion and marketing strategies used for NVPs, most of which takes place online, are intended to entice youth and have the potential to re-normalize smoking. It was reiterated throughout many of the submissions that NVP companies are strategically targeting youth and young adults with the use of social media as advertising channels, glamourizing their products and using flavors that appeal to young people. \"Of significant concern is that this [e-cigarette] marketing is now directed at young people with the use of flavorings such as strawberry custard, chocolate and cereal, amongst others\". Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand and Lung Foundation Australia (written submission 332)",
    "Some submissions suggested that the marketing and advertising of NVPs should be subjected to the same restrictions as tobacco cigarettes, as set out in the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992. This includes prohibiting all types of promotion, advertising, free distribution, sponsorship and point-of-sale display of vaping products. On the other hand, RANZCP recommended heavily restricting advertising instead of complete prohibition, as this would balance the benefits of raising awareness on the relative harms of vaping for current smokers with reducing appeal to youth and non-smokers.",

    "Australian Medical Association (written submission 289) 3.11. Sale and Supply to Minors The need to prevent children and adolescents from accessing vaping products was frequently discussed and unanimously agreed on by all organizations and HCPs.

    "\"E-cigarettes and the related products should only be available to those people aged 18 years and over\".

    "Smoke-Free Policy and NVPs It was frequently mentioned that Australia has been successful in developing a strong smoke-free environment and that access to NVPs and allowing vaping in smoke-free areas may reverse this culture and make smoking socially acceptable again. The majority of organizations, thus, advocated to prohibit vaping, with or without nicotine, in smoke-free areas.",
    "An exception to this, however, was the submission made by RANZCP, which recommended allowing vaping in smoke-free mental health facilities. \"The RANZCP also notes that many mental health facilities are now smoke-free and there may be benefits in allowing the use of e-cigarettes and vaporizers in these settings. This may encourage patients to switch to these less harmful alternatives while reducing the conflicts which smoking bans can sometimes cause.\"",

    "Committee Recommendations After considering submissions, and the views expressed at public hearing, the majority of the Committee suggested in their report that the current regulatory arrangements and exemptions for nicotine and nicotine containing NVPs (including the role of the TGA) remained appropriate and indicated the need for: (1) developing a nationally consistent regulatory approach for non-nicotine containing NVPs; (2) conducting 'an independent and comprehensive review of the evidence' regarding vaping; and (3) developing policy frameworks for assessing and restricting various flavorings used in vaping products. A minority of the Committee, in dissenting reports, recommended that NVPs be made available as consumer products with regulation similar to what has been implemented in the UK.",
    "4. Discussion",
    "It is widely accepted among the public health community that policy making processes should be informed by data and evidence [19], although the types of evidence that are relevant will be contingent Int.",
    "Public Health 2019, 16, 4555 14 of 18 on the way the issue is framed and understood [20]. The limited, and at times, conflicting body of evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of NVPs has resulted in the emergence of profoundly divergent ideologies among policymakers and the public health community [21].",
    "In this study, we examined how health policy actors in Australia framed NVP-related debates and how evidence is taken up and interpreted to justify the different concerns and proposed policy priorities. Among the possible regulatory responses, recommendations against relaxing current restrictions on NVPs (maintaining the status quo) had a greater consensus among government regulators, peak health bodies and health charities.",
    "Most policy actors advocated for abstinence as the only acceptable goal for smokers, emphasized the potential risks associated with vaping products and called for extreme caution in the use and marketing of these products. A detailed analysis of submissions and interview transcripts indicates that the health-related concerns frequently expressed by policy actors who advocated for maintaining the status quo were confined largely to what is not known about NVPs rather than what is already known.",
    "There was also a widespread concern that that the potential societal harm posed by these products would outweigh the 'unproven' potential for any individual benefit. On the other hand, the majority of individual HCPs and public health academics who made submissions placed tobacco harm reduction at the center of their policy objectives and characterized NVPs as novel nicotine delivery technologies that might lead to a dramatic decline in the use of combustible cigarettes.",
    "Although the inherent nature of risk trade-offs in NVP regulation was universally recognized, consideration and tolerability of these trade-offs appeared to vary between stakeholders. Policy actors who recommended against relaxing the current restrictions gave greater weight to potential risk to current non-smokers over potential benefit to smokers.",
    "They asserted that Australia, having a very low prevalence of smoking, should not open up the market to NVPs due to the risk of recruiting new smokers, particularly young people, suggesting that maintaining the status quo is the lower risk policy option. In contrast, those who placed tobacco harm reduction at the center of their policy objectives (RANZCP and majority of individual HCPs and public health academics) recommended a risk proportionate regulatory model that would allow access to NVPs for smokers while discouraging access to and use by adolescents. They also argued that the risks of smoking are likely to be substantially higher than vaping, vaping may also deter or divert youth from taking up smoking, and that a lack of access to an acceptable substitute product such as NVPs could plausibly perpetuate smoking.",
    "It is also noteworthy that while the need for more evidence was universally acknowledged, there were differing views on what was an adequate level of confirmatory evidence required before making any judgement or enacting a policy response. It was common for government agencies and health bodies to assert that unless the safety profile of long term use of NVPs is known, through decades of epidemiological evidence, the current regulatory approach should remain. Some also asserted that NVPs would need to be proven to be 100% risk free to be an acceptable product for smokers to use. This approach was often referred to in the submissions as a 'precautionary approach' or consistent with the 'precautionary principle' as justification for the current restrictive policy on nicotine.",
    "This interpretation of the precautionary principle differs from that of the European Union, which requires policy makers to take the 'level of risk' into consideration when deciding to take proportionate regulatory actions and to consider the consequences of the decision (both inaction and intervention) [22].",
    "Despite the UK, New Zealand, and Australia having similar tobacco control policies and population smoking prevalence, the public health communities in the UK and New Zealand have come to starkly different positions compared to Australia. The majority of health policy actors in the UK have framed NVPs as a tobacco harm reduction tool and endorsed the use of NVPs as a smoking cessation aid among smokers wanting to quit, but who are unable to do so by other means [23].",
    "This framing also appeared to have had traction in the regulatory process as evidenced by the final ruling and stances of notable medical and public health bodies [3,24]. Similar to Public Health England",
    "[3], the New Zealand Ministry of Health also encourages stop smoking services to become 'vaping friendly' and to support smokers to use NVPs to quit smoking [25]. Although the New Zealand government is in the process of Int.",
    "Public Health 2019, 16, 4555 15 of 18 developing new regulations for NVPs that will continue regulating them as consumer products [26], NVPs and e-liquid containing nicotine became legal to sell as a consumer product under the Smoke-free Environments Act 1990, following the outcome of a court ruling in 2018 [27].",
    "In contrast, the outcome of the Australian parliamentary inquiry was a majority report that recommended retaining the current regulatory arrangements and to also look at introducing further restrictions [21]. This suggests that unlike the UK and New Zealand, NVP-related policy outcomes in Australia are grounded in and shaped by conventional tobacco control policies that focus on demand reduction and abstinence (such as tobacco taxation, mass media campaigns, and health warnings), rather than harm reduction approaches.",
    "The UK, on the other hand, has invested to a greater extent than Australia in smoking cessation assistance, such as dedicated stop smoking clinics, and provision of all licensed smoking cessation medicines for free. In this context, widening access to NVPs as a smoking cessation and harm reduction tool is consistent with the greater focus on smoking cessation. It also reinforces the notion that the evidence-based policymaking process involving intractable policy controversies goes beyond a dispassionate evaluation of the evidence base, and is influenced by a wide array of political and institutional factors.",
    "Although the prevalence of daily smoking among adult Australians decreased from 24.3% in 1991 to 12.8% in 2013, there has been only minimal decline over the last few years with only 0.6% reduction rate seen between 2013 and 2016 (from 12.8% in 2013 to 12.2% in 2016) and smoking prevalence remains highly prevalent among many priority populations, including people on low incomes, Indigenous peoples and people with mental illnesses [28]. This is despite Australia being an international leader in implementing tobacco control strategies which reduce the demand and supply of tobacco products.",
    "Although the National Tobacco Strategy 2012-2018 mentioned reducing harm from tobacco use as one of its three pillars [29], harm reduction strategies have not been widely implemented. Although NVPs are not completely safe, evidence suggests that they are less harmful than combustible cigarettes [3,30].",
    "Thus, controlled availability of NVPs could provide a harm reduction tool for unwilling or hard-to-quit smokers. Access to a lower risk substitute for cigarettes could complement demand and supply reduction strategies.",
    "However, Australia's current regulatory framework, however, puts severe restrictions on access to NVPs, with potentially heavy penalties for possession and use without a prescription, while allowing nicotine in the form of smoked tobacco products to be sold as consumer products. One potential consequence of maintaining greater restrictions on nicotine in less harmful forms compared to cigarettes, is that some smokers will continue smoking rather than switching to the lower risk option.",
    "Hence, overly cautious regulation also carries risks such as potentially perpetuating smoking [31], and potential adverse impacts of the current approach were seldom addressed by those referencing the precautionary principle. Moreover, the current regulatory framework does not seem to give due consideration to the views of consumers who are using or want to use NVPs as a cessation or harm reduction tool.",
    "A number of studies have reported that consumers prefer regulatory options that will not impede their ability to obtain and use NVPs [32-35]. Further research that analyses the submissions to public inquiries made by consumers and consumer organizations would be worthwhile to capture their views and preferences for regulations. The Parliamentary submissions (and public hearing transcripts) represent the most recent and comprehensive data from Australian health organizations and health professionals on their views regarding NVP regulation in Australia.",
    "However, our study has some limitations that should be taken into account while interpreting the findings. First, the data is not nationally representative as it is a self-selected sample consisting of only those organizations who made a submission to the Inquiry.",
    "For instance, there were no submissions provided by any of the professional or peak organizations representing pharmacists in Australia. Second, submissions by public health academics and healthcare professionals were made in their individual capacity and views of peak health bodies may not represent the views of all their members.",
    "Thirdly, this study should be regarded as a snapshot in time, as the science surrounding NVPs is fast moving. For example, declines in smoking prevalence in the UK and USA, including among youth, have continued while vaping prevalence has increased [36], which may Int.",
    "Public Health 2019, 16, 4555 16 of 18 allay fears that access to NVPs containing nicotine will lead to smokers delaying quitting smoking, an increase in youth smoking via a 'gateway' effect, and the renormalization of smoking as a socially acceptable behavior. Furthermore, stances and recommendations of health organizations may have changed since the Inquiry was held.",
    "For instance, the Royal Australasian College of Physicians have since released a more nuanced position statement (May 2018) [37]. Nevertheless, this analysis has provided an insight into the views of Australian government and non-government health organizations and other health professionals on safety and efficacy of NVPs and how they should be regulated. 5. Conclusions",
    "The majority of submissions from Australian government and peak health bodies to a Federal Parliamentary Inquiry into vaping products recommended against relaxing current restrictions on the regulation of nicotine for use in these products, describing Australia's current regulatory landscape as a 'sensible harm-reduction approach'. In contrast, most of the submissions from HCPs and public health academics endorsed the role of NVPs as a smoking cessation and/or harm reduction tool. A key argument for prohibiting the sale of nicotine containing vaping products was a perceived lack of clear and convincing evidence regarding the efficacy of NVPs and the difficulty of inferring the likely health outcomes for smokers who switched to vaping based on the current scientific evidence.",
    "Overall, the health-related concerns frequently expressed in the submissions focused largely on the unknown and theoretical risks related to NVP use. There was widespread support for age restrictions on sales and advertising and promotion restrictions, with most submissions supporting similar controls as for tobacco products. A number of barriers to widening access to nicotine for use in NVPs were evident, including the demand for long-term evidence that confirms an unusually high standard of safety and efficacy.",

    "The potential applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care continue to gain attention because of their potential as well as challenges [1]. The potential uses of AI in health care contexts include clinical applications such as disease prediction and diagnosis [2-4] or the use of robots and robotic AI systems in caregiving [5], as well as broader public health applications such as disease outbreak prediction [6] or phone-based location tracking to combat the spread of diseases such as COVID-19 [7,8].",
    "However, developers, health care providers, and policy makers are just starting to contemplate ethical concerns related to AI applications [9], and at a slower pace than the technology is being developed or deployed [10].",
    "Policy makers often acknowledge the importance of engaging citizens in discourse and decision-making on AI but have not yet effectively moved to doing so. For AI to fulfill its potential within health care, it must not only be adopted by physicians and health providers, but also by patients and other members of the public.",
    "To that extent, understanding public acceptance of technology is critical. This includes attitudes and perceptions related to the collection and use of health-related data, without which AI applications will not function [11].",
    "Moreover, although there is expert consensus about what is and is not AI in the health care context [11], public views may be more mixed. Effective engagement and adoption of AI technologies in health care requires knowledge about what nonexperts think about this context. A more systematic understanding of public attitudes toward AI in health care will not only lead to better policy guidance for this topic but it can also inform more effective and responsible research and development",
    "[12]. Theories of technology adoption provide a framework for examining the various social, psychological, and behavioral variables that lead to the acceptance of new technologies. Specifically, the Technology Acceptance Model suggests that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use influence one's attitude toward the technology and intention to use the technology [13].",
    "The importance of acknowledging different public views is critical given that the questions developers, health care providers, and policy makers think are most important to the public may be misaligned with empirical realities. Without a systematic understanding of the perceptions of usefulness, ease of use, and risks and benefits that AI technology in health care poses, the health care community runs the risk of providing the correct answers to the wrong questions.",
    "However, there is currently a lack of attention to public opinion of AI in health care and related issues, such as data privacy. To address this need to better understand different public attitudes toward AI, we summarize key findings from existing nationally representative public opinion surveys on AI in the United States, with a focus on areas related to health care. Previous studies have explored specific stakeholders' attitudes toward AI, including patients [14,15], medical practitioners [16,17], and political officials",
    "[18], among others. Our study is limited to nationally representative surveys to ensure the generalizability of the survey samples to the broader US https://www.jmir.org/2023/1/e40337 XSL*FO RenderX population.",
    "We build on research examining public attitudes toward the application of AI in clinical settings [19,20] and expand the scope to AI and health care more broadly. We summarized the results of surveys focused on the use of AI in health care settings, examining public opinion on issues concerning the risks and benefits of AI, the use of AI in disease diagnosis and treatment, and related issues of data privacy and surveillance (eg, contact tracing).",
    "We also conducted and reported the results of secondary analyses on the associated data sets, when available, to understand differences across key demographics. Our primary research question is as follows: what does existing survey research examining the US publics' attitudes toward AI applications in health care reveal about the challenges and opportunities for more effective and inclusive engagement on the use of AI in health settings? Methods Study Design We conducted a systematic review of public opinion surveys, reports, and peer-reviewed journal articles on public perceptions of AI in the United States.",
    "Our findings were reported following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines [21]. Eligibility Criteria We included studies that (1) are nationally representative US public opinion surveys and (2) include at least one or more questions about attitudes toward AI in health care contexts in the United States. Our criteria for nationally representative surveys included surveys that use either probability or nonprobability sampling, which have been weighted on key demographic measures (eg, age, gender, and education) to match the demographics of the US population",
    "[22]. We excluded studies that did not use representative survey designs, such as studies that reported on convenience samples or were not clearly identified as representative samples [23-25], as well as those that exclusively focused on a specific subpopulation. In addition, we excluded studies that were based on populations outside of the United States, which did not include questions related to the specific AI health focus of this review, or those that were not published in English.",
    "Search Strategy The studies included in this review were identified through searches on Web of Science, PubMed, and Roper iPoll.

For each study, we collected data on the survey title, the month and year the survey was fielded, the sampling method, the sample size, information about how the survey sample was weighted, details on who conducted the survey, and the general topical focus of the survey.",
    "We also recorded the relevant survey questions relating to the applications of AI in health care and the response data for each question. Data Reporting For each survey included in this review, we reported the available descriptive response statistics for the relevant AI health-related questions (eg, the percentage of respondents who agreed to a particular statement).",
    "These data did not include any effect measures. Because this study was limited to public opinion surveys, typical methods to assess the risk of bias in systematic reviews of clinical data do not apply to our descriptive cross-sectional data [26].",
    "Secondary Data Analyses Given the growing concerns about equitable distribution of the risks and benefits of AI applications, we also performed secondary analyses on publicly available data sets to provide findings on attitudes across different demographic groups. Specifically, we examined response patterns broken down by demographic variables such as race, gender, age, education, and income, whenever such demographic variables were available in the data sets.",
    "Among the 11 nationally representative surveys we reviewed, only 3 made their full data sets publicly available for secondary analysis, including 2 data sets from the Pew Research Center [27,28] and 1 from Monmouth University [29]. In addition, we drew on a recent data set fielded by the authors' research group, Science Media and the Public (SCIMEP) [30].",
    "For each of the available data sets, we downloaded publicly available data and applied the weights provided for each sample before running the descriptive analyses of the demographic subgroups. Because survey structure and question wording are unique to each data set, survey question analysis was limited to individual questions and not synthesized across studies.",

    "Trust in Who Controls Personal Information Three surveys included questions related to trust in controlling personal health data. Surveys indicate that the willingness to share personal health data largely depends on who the data-receiving body is (Figure S5 in Multimedia Appendix 2). A 2018 survey by Ghafur et al",
    "[33] (n=1114) indicated that Americans were most willing to share their anonymized health information with personal doctors (61%), followed by one's family (41%), academic or medical research institutions (26%), and pharmacists (25%).

    "Location Tracking and Privacy One survey included questions related to the location tracking of health-related data. The results of this survey suggest that views on whether such tracking is useful or acceptable are mixed.",
    "A survey by the Pew Research Center conducted in April 2020 (n=4917) asked respondents, \"if the government tracked people's locations through their cell phones during the coronavirus outbreak, do you think this would help a lot, a little, or not make a much difference in limiting the spread of the virus?\" [28]. Most US adults (60%) said that such actions would not make much of a difference in limiting the spread of the virus.",
    "https://www.jmir.org/2023/1/e40337 XSL*FO RenderX Regarding acceptability, people have nuanced views depending on who is being tracked and for what purpose.",
    "In the scenario of governments using people's cell phones to track their location, Americans were relatively tolerant of the use for those who have \"tested positive for the coronavirus in order to understand how the virus may be spreading,\" with just over half (52%) of respondents reporting it was either \"very\" or \"somewhat\" acceptable (24% and 28%, respectively) [28].",

    "The aim of this study was to review existing survey research examining the US publics' attitudes on AI applications in health care, and to reveal the potential challenges and opportunities for broad acceptance of the technology in the health care context. We found that a small number of nationally representative surveys (n=11) capture public perceptions of the different aspects, applications, and potential impacts of AI in public health settings. Although most Americans have heard of AI, they are less aware of specific health applications.",
    "Americans anticipate that medicine is likely to benefit from advances in AI, however, the anticipated benefits vary depending on the type of application. Specific application goals, such as disease prediction, diagnosis, and treatment, matter to Americans' attitudes toward AI in health care.",
    "Finally, the related issue of data sharing and health data privacy is a key concern, with most Americans wanting control over their personal health data. J Med Internet Res 2023 | vol.",
    "25 | e40337 | p. 8 (page number not for citation purposes) JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH Beets et al Americans, in general, perceive health care as an area in which AI applications could be beneficial for the field. However, there are substantial concerns regarding specific applications and their benefits to individuals.",
    "This is particularly evident for applications in which AI is involved in decision-making and regarding the privacy and use of health information. Data on the perceived usefulness of AI applications in health care are important for understanding current and future patient attitudes toward and intentions to use the technology [13]. Despite low overall levels of familiarity with AI as a concept or through specific applications, many Americans, especially those with higher education, were aware of and concerned about personal lack of control over how their data are collected and used and by whom.",
    "The majority were also hesitant to agree that AI with primary decision-making power in health care contexts would be a good idea. Assuaging public concern regarding health data privacy and the role of personal data in AI technologies is an important dialogue to cultivate between health care providers, developers, policy makers, and current and future patients. Our secondary analyses of the available public opinion data consistently found that levels of concern and acceptability vary across demographic groups but not always in the same direction.",
    "Across racial demographics, White Americans were typically more likely to believe that people should have the right to delete their personal health data and were more likely to be concerned about sharing data with researchers, using location tracing for combating the spread of COVID-19, or insurance or social media companies using AI and personal data for predictive purposes. Black Americans, however, were more likely than other groups to be concerned about law enforcement having access to personal data.",
    "Polls indicate that most Americans, regardless of their gender or race, have very little trust in companies when it comes to using personal health data. Americans with higher educational attainment reported higher levels of acceptance of sharing data with medical researchers and lower levels of acceptance of sharing data with commercial companies and law enforcement.",
    "They are more likely to report that AI technologies improve individuals' health and that people should have the right to their personal health data. This is notable because much of the health data in the United States are in the hands of private companies [33]. Although questions about the responsibility and rights involved in data collection and use are becoming increasingly important, these are reflected in only a few existing public opinion surveys.",
    "While surveys of experts in technology development and policy found that experts frequently mentioned potential inequalities caused by AI in health care [38], surveys have rarely tapped into different publics' views on inequity issues concerning AI. Furthermore, although trust in different institutions and social groups is likely an important component of perceptions and use of AI in health contexts, little of the survey research that we found included items measuring Americans' trust levels in institutions and social groups involved in AI development itself--a stage in the life span of AI applications that has implications for the subsequent use of AI and related data collection, and one in which early feedback and engagement with public is especially vital.",
    "Limitations Before discussing the implications of our findings, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of this study. The first limitation relates to the claim of representativeness in the included surveys. We limited our search to nationally representative surveys, meaning those based on probability or nonprobability sampling. Each of the 11 surveys included in our review uses a nonprobability sample weighted on various demographic variables.",
    "Weighting this way will improve sampling estimates; however, certain populations such as those less likely to participate in web-based panels may still be underrepresented, biasing the results [39]. Second, this study was limited to surveys of the US population.",
    "Limiting to the United States was intentional, given the unique group-level and social dynamics that come into play in the US health care system. For example, the cultural and demographic differences that impact medical mistrust in the United States [40] likely contribute to attitudes toward different AI applications, data sharing, and privacy.",
    "These factors make it challenging to draw comparisons with other populations. Third, the definitions of AI used in each of the surveys varied (see Multimedia Appendix 3 for a list of definitions).",
    "Fourth, it is possible that we missed surveys that were not included in the PubMed or Web of Science databases. Finally, this study's focus on public opinion data differs from clinical data often included in systematic reviews related to health topics. Although we sought to align our data within the PRISMA framework [21], there are some typical reporting factors that are not included (eg, effect sizes).",
    "Despite these limitations, this study offers an important look at what is currently known and unknown about Americans' attitudes toward AI applications in health care. Future research on public perceptions of AI should work to understand different public views regarding how, why, and for and by whom personal health data should be collected and used.",
    "Going forward, more work is needed to understand different publics' awareness and opinion across the stages of the AI system life cycle, which includes the following: (1) design, data collection, and model building; (2) verification and validation; (3) deployment; and (4) operation and monitoring of AI systems. As AI applications become more widespread in health care contexts, it is critical to understand public perceptions and how public attitudes align with the issues that developers, health care providers, and policy makers consider most important. Moreover, understanding public concerns is a necessary step toward the responsible development of AI.",

    "Introduction Specific regulations for functional foods began in Japan in the middle of the 80's. Known as food for specific health use (FOSHU: foods for specified health use), these foods carry a label of approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare [1]. The goal was to develop foods that would enable the reduction of expenses on public health, considering the high life expectancy in that country [2]. The term \"functional foods\" refers to processed foods, similar in appearance to conventional foods, consumed as part of a normal diet, but demonstrating physiological benefits and/or reduction in chronic diseases risk, in addition to its basic nutritional functions",
    "[1]. The principle was soon adopted worldwide [2].",
    "In Brazil, functional foods were officially recognized in 1999, with the approval of specific legislation [3]. The designations of the claims, as well as the criteria for their approval vary according to the regulations of each country or economic block. Therefore, it is noteworthy considering the regulations of the intended market for the product. The tendency of the Codex Alimentarius1 and of several countries was disciplining these claims on the functional properties of foods or its components, as well as on the security scientific evidence-based, in order to avoid confusion and mistakes to the consumer with nomenclature and claims about properties not scientifically proved [4-7].",
    "Functional foods are an important part of wellness, which also includes a balanced diet and physical activity [8]. The Food Guide for the Brazilian Population of the Ministry of Health 1",
    "The combined program of the United Nations for Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) is an international forum for standardization on food, created in 1962, and its rules aim to protect the health of the population, ensuring fair practices in international and regional trade of food, creating international mechanisms aimed at removing tariff barriers, promoting and coordinating all works held in standardization.

Among the guidelines for this type of food it is allowed functional claims related to the physiological role in the growth, development and normal functions of the body and/or also claims about the general maintenance of health and disease risk reduction, as optional. It is not allowed claims which make reference to the cure or prevention of disease.",
    "The food or ingredient that claim functional and/or health properties can, in addition to basic functions, when it is a nutrient, produce metabolic and/or physiologic effects and/or beneficial effects to health, and it must be safe for consumption without medical supervision. To submit claims of functional property and/or health, food, as well as bioactive substances and isolated probiotics must be, obligatorily, registered in the competent authority.

    "(page number not for citation purposes) JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH Horrell et al Introduction Methods Online Community Growth Currently, 72% of adults seek health information on the Web, and 16% search for peers with similar health concerns [1]. Online communities can effectively extend health education [2,3] and facilitate social support [3,4] and have been linked to improved self-management [2] and enhanced health outcomes",
    "[3]. The number of online communities has grown substantially over the past decade, with countless websites increasing traffic from patients and caregivers through user-engaged communities [5]. Patients are motivated to join these communities to access support, advice, and accountability in reaching health goals [5-7].",
    "Online community growth is crucial to meeting these user needs, as it builds communities' pooled knowledge and increases access to quality informational and social support [5,8-11]. the power of network Larger online networks have effects--where more users increase the usefulness of the community [9].",
    "For those seeking others with shared experiences, larger communities offer a greater number of individuals with the potential for cognitive empathy, particularly from people outside ones' close network where sharing may cause emotional burden [12]. For staff overseeing these sites, limited evidence is available to guide community growth, which is known to be a time- and resource-intensive task [8].",
    "the context of LungCancer.net In this study, we reported the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of Facebook advertising to promote online community growth the LungCancer.net community.in LungCancer.net provides patients and caregivers a platform to learn, educate, and connect with peers and health care professionals. The content published by LungCancer.net is written by patients, caregivers, and health professionals and supplemented by editorial content. In August 2017, LungCancer.net catered to 1575 users and sought to expand their community base through a series of social media advertisements.",
    "With 69% of US adults on Facebook and 74% of users on the site daily [13,14], Facebook seemed to be an ideal platform to promote community growth. The goal of this study was to assess the engagement results of Facebook advertisements designed to increase the number of opt ins to the LungCancer.net online community (ie, the number of users that provided their email to join the community). Facebook Advertisement Campaign From August to December 2017, 5 weeklong Facebook campaigns were launched with the objective of increasing opt ins to LungCancer.net.",
    "Each campaign consisted of 3 unique advertisements that contained an image, a text, and a call to action (Figure 1). The visuals included 6 static images and 1 image in the Graphics Interchange Format (signaled with the \"+\" symbol in Figure 1). The text included messages crafted by community managers and quotes from members.",
    "The target audience was adults (18 years or older) with an interest in lung cancer-related content and/or Facebook pages. No other demographic variables were used to define the audience within the Facebook Ads Manager system.",
    "The budget for each advertisement was US $25 per day. Facebook utilizes a bidding cost system, and actual expenditures for each test averaged within 4% of the desired budget, with the exception of 1 outlying test, which was 19% below the budget. Advertisement Performance Measures The performance of each advertisement was evaluated using metrics rooted in advertisement engagement frameworks [15-17].",
    "According to McGuire's Model of Persuasion, eliciting action begins with advertisement exposure and moves across a continuum of cognitive and behavioral responses [17]. Exposure in this campaign is operationalized as impressions (number of times the advertisement appears in News Feeds) and reach (number of individuals exposed to the advertisement).",
    "Frameworks proposed by Neiger et al [15] and Platt et al [16] were used to define low-to-high behavioral responses.",
    "As the goal of this campaign was to increase opt ins to the LungCancer.net community, low user engagement was defined as interacting with the advertisement through clicks (ie, reacting to the post, clicking a post link, or liking the LungCancer.net Facebook page), medium user engagement was defined as sharing or commenting on the advertisement, and high user engagement was defined as opting in or signing up for the LungCancer.net community. After each campaign, metrics (Table 1) were pulled for each advertisement, and advertisements with the lowest opt in cost were run with new advertisements during the next weeklong campaign. Advertisements with the lowest opt in cost during each weeklong campaign are signaled with the \"++\" symbol in Figure 1.",

    "[25]. Although Facebook advertisements were a cost-efficient community growth tool in this study, other research provides mixed results regarding the effectiveness of Facebook advertising [18,19,26,27]. Some agree that Facebook is an efficient way to draw diverse audiences to health promotion interventions [19,26,27]. Others have found Facebook to be a useful tool to increase advertisement reach, yet the actual rate of results per reach remains low [18,26]. This may indicate that Facebook advertisements are more efficient than traditional approaches (eg, physician referral, direct mail, and email) for online community growth outside research recruitment, where strict eligibility criteria often narrow the target audience [18].",

Research is also needed to identify the impact that community growth through Facebook advertisements has on community engagement. Users who respond to a Facebook advertisement already demonstrate online engagement and may be more likely to contribute to an online health community than members recruited through other traditional strategies.",

    "Page 2 Conclusions--Given currently available information, the effectiveness of HPV vaccination of screened women over age 30 appears, on average, to be small. Compared with current screening that uses sensitive HPV DNA testing, HPV vaccination in this older population is associated with cost- effectiveness ratios that are less attractive than well-accepted interventions in the U.S. Introduction Organized screening is widely credited with reducing the incidence of cervical cancer, and today, women in the United States face an average lifetime risk of 0.7% (1). With the availability of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing, clinical guidelines have been revised to provide several screening options including cytology screening at one- to three-year intervals with HPV DNA testing for triage of equivocal cytology results and HPV DNA testing in combination with cytology at two- to three-year intervals for women over the age of 30 (2- 4).",
    "Previous analyses have reported that these strategies provide not only greater protection against cervical cancer than cytology-only strategies, but also good value for resources (i.e., are cost-effective) compared with other public health interventions that have been adopted (5,6). As technologies continue to evolve, it is imperative to assess the comparative benefits, risks, and costs of all options in an objective analysis.",
    "This principle applies to newer screening tests, novel diagnostic algorithms for screen-positive women, and evolving technologies for primary prevention, such as the HPV vaccine. In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration licensed a quadrivalent vaccine that protects against HPV types 16 and 18, two of the most common types that cause 70% of cervical cancer, as well as types 6 and 11, two types that cause over 90% of genital warts (7,8). A bivalent vaccine, targeting only HPV types 16 and 18, is expected to be licensed soon in the U.S. Because of the high efficacy of the vaccines among females without prior exposure to these types (9-13), current guidelines for HPV vaccination in the U.S. have prioritized covering pre- adolescent girls prior to sexual debut (ages 11-12, and as early as age 9) (14,15).",
    "The recommended upper age limit for a catch-up program, however, has been debated and ranges from age 18 (14) to 26 (15). In a recent cost-effectiveness analysis, we found that a policy of catch-up vaccination in females past age 21 generally does not provide as good value for money as vaccination of younger girls, even under favorable assumptions of the vaccine (16).",
    "Women over age 30 have been the primary target for improved screening technology with HPV DNA testing but may soon be able to access the HPV vaccine. In comparison to adolescent girls, women over age 30 have a greater chance of previous HPV infection at some point in their lives, although there are no commercially available tests that can reliably distinguish those who have or have not been infected. As manufacturers of the vaccines seek approval for vaccinating women of older ages, there is mounting discussion about the magnitude of benefit and costs associated with vaccinating women up to age 45. If approved, current HPV vaccination guidelines will need to be reconsidered, and potentially revised, to provide scientifically-based guidance for this population.",
    "The evaluation of cervical cancer prevention strategies presents particular challenges because of the long duration of cervical carcinogenesis, the uncertainty in a disease process that is largely unobservable, and the fact that interventions are applied at different time points along the disease spectrum. Further, clinical studies that compare screening strategies or assess vaccine efficacy mostly rely on surrogate endpoints, and the observation of these interventions on disease outcomes will be decades away.",
    "When this uncertainty is coupled with the inability to compare head-to-head all potential strategies, disease simulation models that synthesize the best available data and ensure consistency with epidemiological observations are valuable tools to estimate long-term outcomes of health interventions in a population. When used in a decision-analytic framework, model-based analyses can help assess the incremental benefits Ann Intern Med.",

    "Page 3 and cost-effectiveness of different interventions to inform policy decisions that are being made in the absence of complete information. In anticipation of potential vaccine approval for women over age 30, we used an empirically-calibrated model to conduct a comparative cost- effectiveness analysis of HPV vaccination of U.S. women up to the age of 45 in the context of available cervical cancer screening. Methods Model Overview We used a previously-developed individual-based (\"first-order\") Monte Carlo simulation model that simulates the natural history of HPV and cervical disease, as well as primary and secondary preventive interventions (16-18). The model is comprised of mutually-exclusive health states, among which individual women transition over time from entry in the model until death (Figure 1).",
    "The simulation begins with 9-year-old healthy girls, who at each month can acquire an HPV infection, categorized as HPV-16, HPV-18, other high-risk types, and low- risk types. Those with an HPV infection can develop precancerous lesions, categorized as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, grade 1 (CIN 1) or grade 2-3 (CIN 2,3), and those with CIN 2,3 may develop invasive cancer. Females can clear their HPV infection or lesion; after first infection and clearance, women develop a degree of natural immunity to that same HPV type, after which future type-specific infections can be acquired at a reduced rate.",
    "Cancer states are stratified by stage (i.e., local, regional, distant) and detection status (i.e., undetected, symptom- detected, screen-detected). Death can occur from all-cause mortality from every health state and excess cancer-specific mortality from cancer states, depending on stage of cancer. The model can accommodate complex cervical cancer prevention strategies and tracks each individual woman's history (e.g., vaccination, screening, treatment and past abnormalities) and resource use. Using data from epidemiological studies and cancer registries, we established initial input parameter values for the natural history model (i.e., without intervention). Using a likelihood- based approach, the model was then calibrated to fit to empirical data, including age-specific HPV prevalence, age-specific incidence of cervical cancer, and HPV type distribution among women with lesions and cancer, primarily from the U.S. (19-25).",
    "Data from clinical studies and controlled trials were synthesized to accurately reflect the performance of screening tests and HPV vaccine (4,9-13,26-28). Details of the model structure, parameterization, and calibration have been described in previous publications (16-18), and specific data used for the current analysis are available in the Supplemental Appendix.",
    "First, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating women of a particular age (e.g., 35 years) who had been participating in a specific screening strategy (e.g., biennial cytology). This analysis was intended to simulate a situation where women would continue with the same screening strategy before and after vaccination. We included screening strategies that have been recommended in clinical guidelines, including cytology with HPV DNA testing for triage of equivocal results (\"cytology with HPV triage\") and combined cytology and HPV DNA testing after age 30, conducted annually and biennially (2-4). To account for women with less frequent or variable screening histories, we also included a scenario that reflects overall current screening practice. We restricted this analysis to only those who have ever been screened and assumed 53% are screened annually, 17% every two years, 11% every three years, and 15% every five years (29-31).",
    "Second, we evaluated a broader array of technology options that confront women of a particular age. This analysis was intended to simulate a situation where a woman at a particular age (e.g., Ann Intern Med.",
    "Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 October 20. I-NHPAAuthorManuscript Analysis Kim et al.",
    "Page 4 age 35) would consider all available screening options, with and without vaccination. We included currently recommended screening strategies (cytology with HPV triage, with or without a switch to combined cytology and HPV DNA testing at older ages), as well as promising strategies being evaluated in clinical studies (i.e., HPV DNA testing with cytology triage of HPV-positive results at older ages). For all strategies, we assumed women are screened using cytology with HPV triage prior to facing the full range of new options.",
    "Vaccination involved the full three-dose series administered to women at the ages of 35, 40, or 45. In the base case analysis, we assumed 100% efficacy against HPV-16 and -18 over the lifetime among women without prior exposure to these specific types but explored the impact of lower efficacy and waning immunity in sensitivity analysis. Health benefits were expressed as reductions in lifetime risk of cervical cancer and gains in quality-adjusted life years (QALY), which reflect both morbidity (e.g., diminished quality of life due to cervical cancer) and mortality secondary to cervical cancer. Lifetime costs (in 2006 U.S. dollars) included direct medical costs associated with screening, diagnosis, and treatment (e.g., tests, procedures, hospitalizations) and with vaccination (e.g., three doses at $120 per dose, wastage, supplies and administration) (Table 1) (4,5,26-28,32-40). Direct non-medical costs, such as patient time and transportation, were included for all strategies.",
    "We adopted a societal perspective and discounted costs and benefits by 3% annually (41). After eliminating strategies that were more costly and less effective (i.e., strongly dominated) or less costly and less cost-effective (i.e., weakly dominated) than an alternative strategy, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated as the additional cost divided by the additional health benefit associated with one strategy compared to the next-less-costly strategy. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore how results were influenced by uncertainties, such as screening performance, vaccine efficacy and duration, and vaccine cost. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted using 50 good-fitting parameter sets.",

    "Vaccination of Screened Women, by Age and Specific Screening Algorithm Adding HPV vaccination to screening resulted in gains in quality-adjusted life expectancy, although the incremental gains diminished with age. For example, for women who had been screened biennially using cytology with HPV DNA testing for triage of equivocal results, the QALY gains with vaccination were 0.0040 (35 hours) when vaccination occurred at age 35, and 0.0029 (26 hours) when vaccination occurred at age 45; these results correspond to additional reductions in lifetime cancer risk of 5.4% and 4.2%, respectively. Incremental benefits with vaccination were lower when screening was annual or when screening involved a switch to combined cytology and HPV DNA testing after age 30. Among women undergoing annual or biennial screening using cytology with HPV triage, adding vaccination ranged from $116,950 to $272,350 per QALY gained compared to the corresponding strategies of screening without vaccination, depending on age and screening Ann Intern Med.",

    "For those women who switched to combination cytology and HPV DNA testing after age 30, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were less attractive (i.e., higher), ranging from $193,690 to $381,590 per QALY (Figure 2, bottom). In the context of current U.S. screening patterns, in which women are screened with variable frequency, adding vaccination exceeded $125,000 per QALY irrespective of vaccination age or screening strategy. For all scenarios evaluated, the incremental cost-effectiveness of adding vaccination to screening was less attractive (i.e., had higher ratios) at older ages.",
    "HPV-16,-18 Vaccination and Screening Strategies, by Age and Screening Frequency When we comparatively assessed the health and economic outcomes of a range of cervical cancer prevention options facing \"today's older woman\" (i.e., different screening tests and frequencies, with and without vaccination), we found that most vaccination strategies were less efficient (i.e., strongly or weakly dominated) than strategies involving screening alone, or had cost-effectiveness ratios generally exceeding $100,000 per QALY (Table 2). For example, the cost-effectiveness of adding vaccination to annual screening for 35-year-old women ranged from nearly $200,000 per QALY (cytology with HPV triage over the lifetime) to over $400,000 per QALY (cytology with switch to combined testing). At 2- to 3-year screening intervals, vaccination strategies were either weakly dominated or exceeded $130,000 per QALY; ratios fell below $100,000 per QALY with less frequent screening.",
    "For 45-year-old women, these ratios were even less attractive. When HPV DNA testing with cytology triage for HPV-positive results was considered instead of combined cytology and HPV DNA testing for screening post- vaccination (not shown), the ratios associated with vaccination strategies were marginally more attractive, but the overall qualitative results were similar.",
    "Sensitivity Analyses The general results were not influenced by plausible changes in screening test performance, screening and diagnostic follow-up costs, or the discount rate.",
    "Less favorable assumptions regarding vaccine properties, such as efficacy and duration of protection, resulted in higher (i.e., less attractive) cost-effectiveness ratios for the vaccination strategies. For example, when efficacy was reduced to 70% among those without prior exposure to vaccine-types, cost- effectiveness ratios associated with HPV vaccination increased by roughly 50% across all ages and screening scenarios, exceeding $400,000 per QALY for 45-year-old women. Similarly, cost-effectiveness ratios exceeded $400,000 per QALY and $200,000 per QALY for all ages when vaccine protection waned completely after 5 years and 10 years, respectively. Results were modestly influenced by varying the cost of vaccination.",
    "When the cost per vaccinated woman was lowered to $250 (corresponding to a cost per dose of $70), adding vaccination to cytology with HPV triage for 35-year-old women decreased to $54,000 per QALY (biennial screening) and $92,000 per QALY (annual screening). When the cost per vaccinated woman was increased to $750, resembling a scenario in which the current costs are underestimated or a booster dose is required, the cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from $180,000 per QALY to $600,000 per QALY, depending on age, screening modality and frequency. We conducted a probabilistic sensitivity analysis using 50 parameter sets with good fit to the epidemiological data, and estimated the probability that adding vaccination to screening is cost- effective according to lower- and upper-bound cost-effectiveness thresholds. For 35-year-old women, adding vaccination to annual or biennial screening with combined cytology and HPV testing resulted in cost-effectiveness ratios that exceeded $100,000 per QALY over all 50 simulations. In 96% and 72% of simulations involving 3-year and 4-year screening, respectively, adding vaccination was greater than $100,000 per QALY, and none of these scenarios resulted in ratios that were less than $50,000 per QALY across the 50 simulations.",
    "Ann Intern Med. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 October 20. I-NHPAAuthorManuscriptI-NHPAAuthorManuscriptI-NHPAAuthorManuscript Kim et al.",
    "Page 6 Across these same frequencies, for 45-year-old women, 100% of simulations resulted in ratios higher than $100,000 per QALY for vaccination and screening compared to screening alone. Discussion There is great promise in the availability of accurate HPV diagnostics, new screening strategies, and a preventive vaccine against HPV-16 and HPV-18 for cervical cancer prevention in the U.S. Model-based decision analyses of how to best use these new options alone or synergistically can provide insight for policy deliberations and professional guidelines, as well as aid in identifying research priorities. Although previous analyses have evaluated the HPV vaccine in the context of current guidelines for catch-up programs up to age 26 (16,42,43), to our knowledge, our study is the first to assess the vaccine's routine use in an older population of U.S. women. Consistent with the general consensus that the value of HPV vaccination diminishes with increasing age of vaccination (16,43-45), we found that HPV vaccination provides nominal benefits in the context of current screening recommendations and practice among women in their 30s and 40s. Considering the lifetime risk of cervical cancer in the U.S. is less than 1% (1), the absolute risk reductions provided by HPV vaccination in this age group are quite low. Likewise, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios associated with adding vaccination to screening, given currently available information, exceeded $100,000 per QALY in most instances. These results were stable even when evaluating new, promising screening algorithms using HPV DNA testing with cytology triage, which is expected to have a higher positive predictive value than cytology testing alone post-vaccination (46).",
    "There is no universal criterion that defines a threshold cost-effectiveness ratio, below which an intervention would be considered \"good value for money.\" Unlike some countries, the U.S. has not adopted an absolute cost-effectiveness threshold. Rather, informal heuristics have been cited, including the cost-effectiveness ratio associated with renal dialysis through the Medicare entitlement program (ranging from $55,000 to $108,500 per QALY (47-50)) to those associated with widely-adopted interventions, such as diabetes care, knee replacement, and mammography screening (generally below $100,000 - and often below $50,000 - per QALY (51-53)). Most recently, Shiroiwa et al. (54) measured thresholds in selected countries and reported $62,000 per QALY gained in the U.S. Based on these considerations, we feel that a range of $50,000 to $100,000 per QALY gained is a reasonable benchmark for cost- effectiveness in the U.S., although it is important to note that societal willingness to pay more than $100,000 per QALY may be based on other considerations.",
    "Using this threshold range, our results suggest that a policy of HPV vaccination in older women does not represent good value for resources expended, implying that more health can be gained by investing in alternative health interventions, such as screening previously unscreened women. The vaccine's impact in an older population is influenced in part by the level of prior exposure to the vaccine-targeted HPV types. Clinical trials have reported that the majority of female participants up to age 26 were not exposed to any vaccine-type at enrollment (55,56), and therefore stand to benefit completely from the vaccine; however, because the trials excluded women with more than four sexual partners, it is unclear whether the trial population is representative of the general U.S. population with respect to exposure status and how these data extend to women up to 45 years of age. In order to explore the uncertainty in the natural history of disease, including prior exposure to HPV, we conducted a probabilistic analysis using 50 distinct parameter sets that fit well to the empirical data on HPV and cervical disease in the U.S. We found that the probability of HPV vaccination being cost-effective for screened women ages 35 to 45 was quite low at a threshold of $100,000 per QALY, even at extended screening intervals.",

    "This analysis captures the average health and economic impact of the interventions over an entire population, intended primarily to inform the comparative effectiveness of health services, a priority recently highlighted in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (57). Despite its policy focus, the analysis can also provide insights into clinical decision-",
    "making for women with particular screening histories who may benefit differentially from vaccination and screening. Specifically, our study provides estimates of the potential added value of vaccination compared not only to the counterfactual scenario (i.e., continuation of screening without vaccination), but also to new strategies that could involve revised screening algorithms and testing options (e.g., HPV DNA testing with cytology triage). Although, on average, we found that HPV vaccination does not provide good value among women of older age groups, there are undoubtedly individuals who could benefit from the vaccine. Because there is no conclusive test to identify an individual's prior infection history, decision making for an individual will need to involve information about the person's risk of HPV exposure (i.e., number of sexual partners) and particular screening history (i.e., compliance and frequency), as well as the woman's preferences.",
    "Limitations include uncertainty in the natural history of cervical disease, particularly in older women. As previously noted (58), whether an HPV infection detected at older ages is a newly- acquired infection or one that was acquired many years before and has re-emerged will influence the vaccine's impact in older women, but is subject to much uncertainty and debate. Our probabilistic analysis attempts to explore plausible scenarios of natural history uncertainties, while maintaining a good fit to data that are available from empirical studies.",
    "Also, vaccine efficacy data using HPV infection and cervical disease endpoints are only available for five years and are only recently being presented for women in older age groups (59,60). In our analysis, we optimistically assumed that women up to age 45 were fully compliant to the three-dose vaccine series, and that those without prior exposure to vaccine- types received complete lifelong protection from the vaccine. Given these optimistic assumptions, our results could be considered a \"best-case scenario\"; to the extent that efficacy is lower or of shorter duration, cost-effectiveness ratios for vaccination strategies may be even less attractive than presented in the current study. This analysis did not consider the effects of reduced HPV transmission attributable to vaccination of older women, resulting in herd immunity benefits. We also did not include the vaccine's potential cross-protective effects against other high-risk HPV infections nor the benefits related to other HPV-associated conditions, such as other anogenital, oral, and oropharyngeal cancers; the natural histories of these conditions - and contribution of HPV-16,-18 - are far less certain, and vaccine efficacy data on these outcomes are limited.",
    "Previous cost-effectiveness studies that have included some or all of these factors have suggested that their inclusion does not offset the diminished efficacy among women of older ages (16,61). It is important to note that we did not incorporate the risks of adverse events or diminished quality of life from vaccination (e.g., side effects) or screening (e.g., overtreatment). Even though small risks of minor adverse events from either intervention will likely be outweighed by the overall average benefits at the population level, as data become available, studies should incorporate all risks and costs associated with a vaccination program. We also assumed that a woman's screening interval would not change post-vaccination; since a woman's particular history of vaccine-type HPV exposure - and therefore her level of vaccine protection - is unknowable with certainty in clinical practice, we assumed that extending a woman's screening interval without more information would be unjustifiable. Finally, this analysis is not relevant for women who have never been screened, who may comprise up to 5% of screen-eligible women in the U.S. (29-31). Both vaccination and screening will likely have beneficial effects in this population, but the magnitude of benefit from either approach will depend on important Ann Intern Med.",

    "Abstract: The potential of urban parks to enhance social welfare and deliver health benefits has been recognized. However, it is still unclear which landscape characteristics in urban green spaces best improve the physical activity levels of users. Little is known about the relationship between the microenvironment of urban green spaces and the physical activity of children, particularly in the context of high levels of childhood obesity. Using the self-report method, we extracted the perceived environmental characteristics of the landscape and combined this with behavior observation to obtain the level of children's physical activity in green spaces and to explore the influence of the characteristics of green spaces on these activities. Our results show that the highest levels of activity were found in the semiopen spaces of urban parks, which mainly consist of dense vegetation and a diverse range of recreation facilities.",
    "Play facilities were most closely related to the level of intensity of children's activities, and perceived safety was the primary social perception factor affecting their activities. In addition, perceptions of the social environment were found to play a significant intermediary role in the impact of green space on children's physical activity. The study results are intended to promote green space planning and design updates, improve the public health level of children, and provide a basis for the construction of child-friendly cities.

    "Introduction Child obesity is one of the most serious public health challenges of the 21st century [1]. The rate of overweight and obesity in children is continuously increasing [2], leading to a greater risk of chronic diseases [3].",
    "The promotion of physical exercise in children is an influential factor in solving this problem. Furthermore, sports activities have many benefits for children's mental health",
    "[4] and cognitive development [5,6] and improve their cardiopulmonary health and sports skills [7].",
    "One of the most effective strategies to promote children's PA is to improve the physical environment, such as urban parks, to actively encourage children to use these green spaces [8]. Urban parks with accessible recreational facilities are critical environmental resources for children participating in PA [9].",
    "It is therefore important to explore the factors that encourage children to engage in physical activity, which not only improves their current health status but may also produce significant health benefits in the future [10]. With the attention paid to children's interests and rights to space, there has been increasing research concerning child-friendly environments [11], covering topics such Citation: Bao, Y.; Gao, M.; Luo, D.; Zhou, X.

The shaping of urban green spaces should fully consider the needs of children and young people [12] while respecting their rights.",
    "The Playful City proposal emphasized the provision of high-quality activity space for children and the development of urban spaces to support children's participation in play and games [13]. For children, the natural environment provided by urban green space is not only an objective physical environment but also encourages activities.",
    "Experiencing nature is an indispensable part of a child's growth process [14]. In addition, many studies emphasize that natural environments dominated by green space play a comprehensive and positive role in promoting the physical and mental health of children, leading to better mental health, positive environmental values, an excellent cognitive ability, a strong desire to learn, fewer physical diseases, and faster recovery [15,16].",
    "The external environmental characteristics of urban green spaces have led many researchers to conclude that the availability and accessibility of green spaces are important factors affecting the behavior of children [17,18], and directly regulate the health benefits for children in terms of encouraging higher levels of physical activity. However, there is insufficient research that considers both the physical activity level of children and the microlandscape characteristics of green spaces.",
    "The theoretical framework of the ecological model includes the environmental deter- minants of sports activities. It proposes that sports activities are influenced at multiple levels, such as personal factors, the social environment, and the physical environment, and policy-level factors",
    "[19]. However, current research mainly focuses on social and environ- mental factors [20]. For example, the perception of the environment [21] has been proven to affect physical activity levels.",
    "Perceptions include the proximity, quality [22], and type of facilities [23], as well as the proportion of natural landscape [24,25], and the provision of fun activities [26].",
    "The pressure caused by the lack of perceived safety may increase the static load [27], negatively affecting children's and adolescents' physical activity [28]. An adverse environmental security assessment will decrease participation and willingness to engage in physical activity [29]. Outdoor game space is easier to achieve the shaping of small-scale children's health environments characteristics such as a sense of attachment, sense of safety and satisfactio",
    "[30]. Children's perception of the environment will directly affect their level of physical activity. However, their perception of the social environment may also affect their level of activity. Therefore, exploring the impact and benefits of a multi-level environment is necessary [31].",
    "This will help us to fully understand the impact of urban green space environments on children's physical activity level. Space elements have a more significant influence on outdoor activities",
    "[32,33]. Children pay more attention to the playability of an environment and its fun features, for example, flowing water",
    "[34] or spatial shape [35], than adults.",
    "The possibility of outdoor activities in green spaces is particularly effective in enhancing children's sense of enjoyment [36] and mental health [37] and is therefore essential for children's well-being [38,39]. However, the design of outdoor recreation spaces for children is still focused on their utility rather than the benefits of urban green spaces for children's health",
    "[40], cognition, and emotions, and the factors that influence these. Therefore, there is a need to further explore the beneficial impact of the characteristics of urban green spaces on various dimensions of children's development. It is easier to shape the perception attributes of green space than those of social environ- ments [41].",
    "Activities, communication, participation, and enjoyment of nature in outdoor spaces are all related to the formation of place attachment [42]. In turn, attachment to places also affects the activities of children [43] because a place where they can form attach- ments and freely express their feelings will become their favorite place for activities",
    "[44]. However, a lack of security will negatively affect the physical activity level of children and adolescents [45,46], and adverse environmental security will decrease their willingness to participate in activities [47].",
    "In the existing research, there is a lack of systematic analysis of the impact of green space landscape and social environment factors on physical activity. Without exploring the joint influence of landscape environments and social environments on children's physical activity levels, it is difficult to provide guidance for the landscape Forests 2023, 14, 423 3 of 14 planning and design of urban parks and useful adjustments that could be made to existing urban green spaces. This study aims to build an urban park environment that supports children's engage- ment in activities and to explore how urban green space environments can promote the physical activity levels of children.",
    "The study provides new ideas for urban public green space construction, planning, and design, with regard to the health benefits for children. Through quantitative analysis of the urban green space environment characteristics that affect the physical activity levels of children, we contribute to a deeper and more intuitive understanding of the service benefits of urban green space for children and how an effective balance between green space characteristics and the physical and mental health needs of children can be achieved.

    "Influence of Space Type on Physical Activity In order to explore the spatial environment factors that affect the physical activity levels of children, this study verified the relationship between the different types of spaces in urban parks and the activity levels of children [22] and concluded that among the various types of spaces in urban parks, semiopen space had the highest level of physical activity, followed by undergrowth space.",
    "Semiopen spaces often provide room for children's activities in the form of squares and have many entertainment facilities [50]. Such spatial characteristics mainly manifest in environments with more diverse types of play facilities and vegetation",
    "[51]. The play opportunities, vegetation, and beautiful scenery provided by semiopen spaces encourage children to be more active [52].",
    "On the other hand, although previous studies have shown that the presence of water has benefits for health and well-being and is also positively related to physical activity [53], our results show a lower level of physical activity near water. The main reason for this result may be related to the safety of activities in waterfront spaces [54].",
    "Therefore, to encourage high-intensity activities in urban parks, it is particularly vital to ensure that there is a reasonable level of perceived safety together with appropriate service facilities. Greater attention should be paid to the perceived safety and accessibility of facilities for children, the selection of natural and artificial elements and materials, the color design of the site, and the impact of seasonal changes [55,56]. These results could provide a basis for implementing and evaluating environmental interventions to encourage higher levels of physical activity.",
    "In addition, the study further confirmed that natural landscapes could meet the needs of children for a stimulating and changing play environment. Children can improve the quality of their activities by playing in natural recreation facilities [57].",
    "4.2. Perceiving the Benefits of Environment on Physical Activity This study emphasizes that in urban green space, the impact of the perceived environ- ment on children's activities is very significant. In green spaces, the landscape environment has a positive and significant relationship with the physical activity levels of children. From the multiple regression model, it was concluded that the landscape elements that significantly impacted the degree of physical activity were the facilities that provided playability, followed by interesting natural scenery, even though, compared with naturally designed spaces, the Kit Fence Carpet style provides fewer opportunities for play [58].",
    "It is undeniable that the natural environment and facilities provided by green spaces [59] have a positive effect on children's activities [60]. For example, slides, swings, rock climb- ing equipment, and age-appropriate adventure facilities are all elements that encourage Forests 2023, 14, 423 10 of 14 children to perform physical activities",
    "[61]. These are also very important landscape ele- ments.",
    "In addition, children enjoy activities in a place where they can have contact with their playmates and make use of the facilities [62]. Therefore, the attraction of the green space environment and the enjoyment of activities in that environment promote children's physical activity and form a \"positive feedback\" relationship.",
    "In the intermediary variable model of urban park landscape environment affecting children's physical activities, the social environment of landscape characteristics affecting children's physical activities can explain the impact path. Of these, the impact of perceived safety is a critical factor for encouraging physical activity in children",
    "[63]. It plays a powerful intermediary role in promoting activities in the outdoor environment, among the effects of social environment perception characteristics on children's physical activity levels and perceived safety of activity. Children pay more attention to the sense-of-place identity created by green space.",
    "This feeling can be expressed as, \"I will be more relaxed and happy when I am here, and I will miss this place when I am not here.\" These results can help urban managers and policymakers to protect the rights and spatial interests of children in cities by following guidelines for the construction of child-friendly cities",
    "[64], creating an excellent social environment and promoting the development of children in cities. 4.3.",
    "Planning Green Space to Enhance Physical Activity The landscape features in urban parks and the social environment they create can attract and promote children's engagement in physical activities. In addition, parents believe that the naturalness of such activity spaces promotes the physical and mental development of their children",
    "[65,66]. In green spaces, the relationship between the richness of the natural scenery and the activity level of the children is the strongest, showing that the composition and characteristics of landscape elements affect children's perception of the natural environment [67,68]. It reflects the natural style and seems to shape the way to link green space with health",
    "[69] through the presence of plants, flowers, and tree cover [70]. This perception of a preference for the natural environment attracts children to participate in activities. There is a considerable difference between adults and children in terms of their understanding of the availability of environmental functions.",
    "Children are keen to interact with the environment. For example, adults believe trees can provide shade, privacy, or isolation from noise. However, for children, trees are quiet and hidden places for playing, carving, climbing, and playing hide and seek.",
    "Therefore, green space has a tremendously positive effect on the cognitive attitude of children towards nature and improves their activity levels [57,71]. In addition, to meet the wants of children in terms of their age and gender, more consideration should be given to the number of activity spaces and the population of children in the area when sites are designed.",
    "Different types and scales of play activity for all age levels that can be easily maintained should be provided [55]. The construction of urban green space should be re-examined from the perspective of protecting children's rights, and space and resources should be redistributed in the process of urban green space renewal.",
    "4.4. Limitations and Prospects Our research was limited by critical factors and its cross-sectional nature, which may affect its universality, in particular for cities with different economic environments. In addi- tion, our research results may have selective daily liquidity bias or confusion of personal characteristics because of personal preferences that simultaneously lead individuals to visit certain places and drive their behavior in these places. Furthermore, when conducting questionnaire surveys with children, it was evident that some of them had little experience with the natural environment, which may have affected their response when combined with the fact that children's perceptual function is not of a spatial nature",
    "[57,67]. Forests 2023, 14, 423 11 of 14 Future research will require additional resources to address these limitations. The causality can be confirmed through long-term follow-up research, further expanding the research locations, and more refinement of the green space characteristics.",
    "5. Conclusions Our research established the impact of urban parks on the physical activity of children. Of the various types of space, semiopen space was the most functional space for children due to its dense vegetation and diverse range of recreation facilities. Play facilities had the most significant impact on activities.",
    "The landscape and social environment had a positive impact on physical activity. Furthermore, use of the multiple regression model revealed that the effect of green space on children's physical activity was 54%, emphasizing the positive role of urban green space with a natural setting in promoting children's participation in physical activity.",
    "In addition, the social environment played a significant role among the environmental characteristics affecting children's physical activity, with safety shown to be more significant than attachment. The critical factors needed to improve children's activity levels are more focused on creating an attractive natural landscape and playable facilities.",
    "From the perspective of developing a green space environment that promotes children's physical activity levels, this study provides new evidence for constructing an urban park environment to support children's engagement in activities. For urban planners, these findings point to a new way of thinking about the design of urban green spaces, not with regard to quantity, but in terms of naturalness, fun, and the characteristics of children's activities in the urban environment. In addition, there is an urgent need for more research, especially regarding landscape design in green spaces.

However, PrEP uptake to date has been limited and inequitable.",
    "Analyzing the readability of existing PrEP-related information is important to understand the potential impact of available PrEP information on PrEP uptake and identify opportunities to improve PrEP-related education and communication. Objective: We examined the readability of web-based PrEP information identified using search engines and on Twitter. We investigated the readability of web-based PrEP documents, stratified by how the PrEP document was obtained on the web, information source, document format and communication method, PrEP modality, and intended audience. Methods: Web-based PrEP information in English was systematically identified using search engines and the Twitter API.",
    "We manually verified and categorized results and described the method used to obtain information, information source, document format and communication method, PrEP modality, and intended audience. Documents were converted to plain text for the analysis and readability of the collected documents was assessed using 4 readability indices. We conducted pairwise comparisons of readability based on how the PrEP document was obtained on the web, information source, document format, communication method, PrEP modality, and intended audience, then adjusted for multiple comparisons. Results: A total of 463 documents were identified.",
    "Overall, the readability of web-based PrEP information was at a higher level (10.2-grade reading level) than what is recommended for health information provided to the general public (ninth-grade reading level, as suggested by the Department of Health and Human Services). Brochures (n=33, 7% of all identified resources) were the only type of PrEP materials that achieved the target of ninth-grade reading level. Conclusions: Web-based PrEP information is often written at a complex level for potential and current PrEP users to understand.",
    "This may hinder PrEP uptake for some people who would benefit from it. The readability of PrEP-related information found on the web should be improved to align more closely with health communication guidelines for reading level to improve access to this important health information, facilitate informed decisions by those with a need for PrEP, and realize national prevention goals for PrEP uptake and reducing new HIV infections in the United States.",

    "JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE Park et al KEYWORDS pre-exposure prophylaxis; PrEP; health literacy; health education materials; readability; prophylaxis; health information; electronic health education; HIV; infection; Twitter Introduction Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is proven to prevent HIV infections [1-3], and using PrEP to prevent new HIV infections among vulnerable populations has been identified as a critical strategy in the Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative [4]. PrEP use increased more than 10-fold in the United States in just 5 years after its approval in 2012 [5]. However, inequitable PrEP uptake persists in the United States [6-8], especially in the southern United States and among Black and Hispanic residents in the United States.",
    "When those who need PrEP the most do not receive it, we lose opportunities to maximize reductions in new HIV infections. One potential explanation for lower uptake among vulnerable populations for HIV infections is the lower level of health literacy in these groups (ie, people in the southern United States, people living in poverty, younger people, and people of Black race or Hispanic ethnicity)",
    "[9,10]. Thus, analyzing the readability (ie, how difficult a text is to understand) of web-based information about PrEP would help understand the effectiveness of available web-based PrEP information and the identify opportunities understandability of information for people who might benefit from PrEP.",
    "improve to Health literacy is an individual's ability to obtain and understand health information to make informed health decisions [11]. The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)",
    "[12,13], the National Institutes of Health (NIH) [13,14], the American Medical Association (AMA) [15], and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)",
    "[16] recommend health information for the public be written at the ninth-grade reading level or lower to ensure that most people in the US population (ie, the general public) can make informed health decisions. However, researchers have consistently found evidence that text-based health information resources, including web-based resources, are too complex for the general public [17-25]. For example, patient education materials for electronic cigarettes [22], mental health",
    "[17], pediatrics [23], medical specialties [24], diabetes mellitus",
    "[18], clinical orthopedics [19], human papillomavirus immunizations",
    "[20], and cardiovascular diseases [21] were found to require higher literacy levels than that recommended by the NIH, AMA, FDA, and HHS. Moreover, health information available from commercially funded sources was significantly more difficult to read than the information available from government-funded sources for some health conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, depression, high cholesterol, arthritis, asthma, heartburn, obesity, influenza, and erectile dysfunction [26], but not for electronic cigarette information",
    "[22]. This complexity often led to comprehension errors [27,28]. The readability of web-based PrEP information has also been reported [25], but the previous assessment was limited to 100 unique websites and did not include information circulated on social media.",
    "Additionally, the previous assessment did not stratify the assessment, which limits our understanding of how to improve the readability of educational materials. For https://publichealth.jmir.org/2023/1/e48630 XSL*FO RenderX information related to PrEP use, the increasing complexity of educational materials has been associated with lower uptake of PrEP [29,30].",
    "There are other factors that can impact the understandability of PrEP information and accessibility to certain populations. For example, the format of the information (eg, brochure and website), the information source (eg, US government entities and for-profit organizations), and the intended audience could impact the readability of and trust in materials. Thus, different forms and sources of information should be examined for readability; these data should be interpreted in light of intended audiences who might require different levels of complexity.",
    "Analyzing updated content is also important because new PrEP delivery methods continue to gain approval and become available to consumers. For example, with the recent approval of injectable PrEP [31], readability studies of PrEP information need to be updated to include this new delivery method.",
    "Assessments of readability should also include information disseminated through social media [32,33], which is an important source of passive information for many young people. However, many recent studies on the readability of health-related content on the web [17-25] have either focused solely on information obtained actively through search engines [17,18,20-22,24,25] or within popular websites for consumers [19,23]. It is important to examine health information that is obtained both actively via search engines and passively via social media channels.",
    "The latter is critical because >80% of Americans use at least one social media platform [34] and major health agencies, such as World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), regularly communicate via Twitter feeds.",
    "Social media content can include news releases as well as discussions on various health topics (eg, sexually transmitted infections, emergency situations [35,36], and preventive measures [33]). We aimed to improve our understanding of the readability of publicly available web-based and social media-based PrEP information by analyzing it based on its information source, document format, communication method, PrEP modality, and intended audience.",
    "Our findings can be used to develop communication strategies that are tailored to the needs of different objectives and improve health literacy and the understandability of PrEP information for the general public. Methods Data Collection We collected examples of both passively (eg, social media posts) and actively (information sought through user-initiated web searches) obtained information.",
    "Collecting Passively Obtained Information For passively obtained information, we collected PrEP-related information exchanged through Twitter. Twitter was chosen because many health organizations currently use Twitter to JMIR Public Health Surveill 2023 | vol. 9 | e48630 | p. 2 (page number not for citation purposes) JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE Park et al communicate health messages, including information about PrEP and HIV prevention, to the public [37,38].",
    "About 22% of US adults use Twitter (45% of 18- to 24-year-olds); many (42%) check the platform more than once a day [39]. Tweets are short, being limited to 280 characters, but often refer readers to longer text information through embedded URLs.",
    "Thus, we investigated patient-level information sources (ie, brochures and websites) that were disseminated by URLs in tweets. We assessed and compared the readability of PrEP information based on the method used to obtain information (ie, passively or actively), information source (ie, organization type), document format (eg, brochures and websites), PrEP modality (ie, oral and injectable), and the intended audience (ie, patient, provider, and general).",
    "To assess passively obtained information on PrEP, we used PrEP-related tweets with URLs as a starting point. Using Twitter API [40], we first collected PrEP-related tweets from July 2012, when the FDA first approved the PrEP indication for a pharmaceutical medication [41], to January 31, 2022, based on PrEP-related keywords that were used in a previous study",
    "[42] and a new set of keywords related to injectable PrEP [31] (Textbox 1). To emulate how users might search for information about PrEP on the web, we started from the Twitter URLs and further assessed the contents of external URLs that were embedded in the original URL (ie, manual web crawling).

Then for comparison purposes, we specifically searched for \"medication guide,\" \"patient information,\" \"info for people,\" \"information for the patient,\" \"information for the user,\" and \"patient version\" of known PrEP medications, (eg, Truvada, Descovy, Apretude, Vocabria, and cabotegravir).",
    "For each of the 5 search engines, search results were collected from the first page for each search engine because most users rarely read past the first page of search results [43] and because our focus was to analyze the most frequently accessed web-based PrEP information. We did not include sponsored listings, as we wanted to focus on the most relevant and unbiased information. We manually verified search results to ensure that we only included web pages with PrEP information. We then systematically and manually web crawled these pages, using links from the search results as a starting point to emulate user behavior.",
    "Several false-positive links were excluded from the search results that were related to different acronyms or abbreviations (eg, Professional Research Experience Program). We also excluded documents without any PrEP-related information (eg, content about drugs used only for HIV treatment). We also excluded papers published in peer-reviewed journals that are not intended for the general public and would skew the readability results.",

    "Intended Audience Most documents (n=426, 95.5%) were categorized as \"general public\" because they did not specify their intended audience. We found 14 documents specifically written for PrEP users and 6 specifically written for providers.",
    "The readability grade level indices of content intended for PrEP providers (15.6 grade level, SE 1.59) were significantly higher when compared to the content intended for patients (10.2 grade level, SE 0.3; adjusted P<.001) and the general public (10.1 grade level, SE 0.1; adjusted P<.001). The reading level of content written for PrEP users was similar to that of materials for the general public (adjusted P=.84). Discussion Principal Findings Our study highlights the challenging task of effectively educating diverse audiences about PrEP.",
    "Our results are consistent with previous work [25], which found that web-based PrEP information is often difficult to understand. We add to this previous work by including data disseminated in social media and stratifying web-based PrEP documents by how the PrEP document was obtained on the web, information source, document format and communication method, PrEP modality, and intended audience.",
    "We found PrEP materials from Twitter were significantly easier to comprehend than those identified by web searches, despite the fact Twitter was merely posting URLs of web-based information. It is possible that organizations selectively identify more comprehendible materials to promote through Twitter. The readability of web-based PrEP information from different organizational groups was all higher than recommended, and there was no significant difference between them (Table 1).",
    "This contrasts with a previous study that focused on different health conditions [26].",
    "Informational documents intended for providers had significantly higher reading levels than those intended for patients or the general public. However, the materials intended for the patients and the public were still higher than the recommended ninth-grade reading level. https://publichealth.jmir.org/2023/1/e48630 XSL*FO RenderX P value <.001 Adjusted P value <.001",
    "Brochures were the only type of PrEP materials that achieved the HHS and NIH target of ninth-grade reading level [13]. Brochures have been used in successful public health campaigns for facilitating behavior change, knowledge increase, and self-efficacy for other health conditions [56]. Brochures may be effective means of PrEP communication for most people who are not medical providers. However, brochures were not a common mode of conveying information: there were only 33 brochures in 446 unique documents that we identified.",
    "As PrEP regimens become more complex (eg, injectable PrEP and 2-1-1 PrEP), educational materials might become more difficult to comprehend. For example, we identified that a higher reading level was required to understand materials about injectable PrEP. Yet, there is great interest in injectable PrEP: in a National HIV Behavioral survey of 314 people, injectable PrEP was preferred by 3 times more respondents compared to oral PrEP [31]. This calls for attention to improving the readability of materials describing injectable PrEP because difficulty in understanding injectable PrEP information could discourage people who would otherwise be interested in the new PrEP route of administration.",
    "Our findings suggest that there is a need for health communication strategies and policies that support the development and dissemination of clear and concise PrEP information. Our finding suggests that health communication strategies can be enhanced by using brochures and plain language, which may include avoiding jargon. Policies can also be improved to support this effort.",
    "For instance, governments could increase funding for research into PrEP literacy and the development of PrEP communication guidelines. Additionally, governments could mandate that health care providers receive training on how to communicate about PrEP in a clear and easy-to-understand way for a variety of audiences. Together, these communication strategies and policies can help individuals to have access to clear and easy-to-understand information about PrEP, which can help to increase PrEP uptake and reduce HIV transmission.",
    "JMIR Public Health Surveill 2023 | vol. 9 | e48630 | p. 7 (page number not for citation purposes) JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE Park et al information on Limitations",
    "Our findings should be understood in the light of their limitations. First, individuals accessing PrEP information on the web may be a select subgroup of those interested in PrEP and might have higher or lower health literacy than those who seek information from other sources. However, given that the internet has become an increasingly popular resource for health information [32,57] and groups potentially eligible for PrEP [58] tend to have high internet use [59], it is likely that a substantial proportion of potential and current PrEP users would seek PrEP the web. Second, current general-purpose readability indices alone may not be a perfect measurement of comprehension and reading level",
    "[60,61], especially for assessing documents with nontext content, such as charts, graphs, and videos. For instance, we noted that all brochures in our data set contained images.",
    "Pictorial and graphic representations of information have been shown to be more effective than text-only messages [62]. Similarly, we found that some websites also contain PrEP-related informational videos; videos have been shown to be effective in modifying health behaviors, including promoting HIV testing [63].",
    "In this study, we focused on textual information as text remains the primary medium for health communication on the web [64] and relied on the average scores of 4 readability indices to minimize the lack of sensitivity or breadth of measurements from using a single metric. Third, our analysis, although systematic, was not exhaustive. The web-based PrEP information included in our study was collected from a variety of sources, yet it is possible that some important information was missed. We limited our search to English language materials, and the first page of the search result imitated users' web-based behavior [43].",
    "Lastly, we did not use generic names of PrEP medications, thus potentially not including PrEP information that only might use the generic names. Future Directions Despite public guidelines for writing health education materials, readability levels of web-based health materials, even those written by public health organizations, have either become more difficult [65] or reflected no improvement [19] with few exceptions [66].",
    "AMA guidelines suggest addressing health literacy concerns by avoiding unnecessary details and lengthy background information [15]. This recommendation is consistent with our finding that documents in the brochure format, which were assessed as most readable, were concise, focused more on patient needs, and provided less background information. Readability is only one measure of the impact of health information, for example, measures of health literacy are evolving to include measures of the extent to which materials increase decision-making ability [67].",
    "Thus, future research on health literacy should extend to whether educational materials are helpful to clients in making informed decisions. Social media platforms have been widely used for public health communication and education, but research focused on measuring the effectiveness of social media as a channel for public health information is limited (with a few notable exceptions",
    "[68]). A better understanding of social media platforms' effectiveness should improve public health communication and the development of an impactful campaign for facilitating behavior change, knowledge increase, and self-efficacy related to public health needs--including PrEP uptake. Inequitable PrEP uptake persists among racial, ethnic, and gender minority communities",
    "[6,7]. Follow-up studies should (1) optimize the effectiveness of web-based educational materials in making informed decisions among health equity populations and (2) tailor messaging to address the information needs of specific populations to address inequitable PrEP uptake.",
    "Future studies of the readability of web-based PrEP information should consider the following points. PrEP use and HIV prevention are global concerns, and it is important to understand how people in other languages are accessing and understanding information about PrEP.",
    "Future studies should examine materials in other languages. To provide a more comprehensive picture of the range of available web-based PrEP information, future work can expand the data collection process by expanding the number of result pages, search keywords, search engines, and search locations and by applying various filters to narrow and rank the search results. In addition, future work should consider exploring other measures of comprehension, especially for materials that include images, videos, and other nontext elements. We believe that these measures will strengthen the findings and provide a more comprehensive picture of how people are understanding information about PrEP.",
    "Conclusions The overall reading level of PrEP information found on the web was above that recommended for most potential users; if unaddressed, other challenges to supporting PrEP use by those most likely to benefit might be made more difficult because of a gap in comprehension of web-based information. The readability of web-based PrEP information needs to be improved to comply with health communication recommendations, reduce the barrier of a health literacy gap, facilitate informed decisions by those with a need for PrEP, and counter the HIV epidemic.",

Many countries, even different bodies and organizations within the same country, have developed nutrient recommendations and dietary guidelines using a diversity of approaches. The process, criteria and types of evi- dence to support the recommendations are not clearly specified in all of the reports(1). Recommendations are not always aligned and controversies remain with respect to the scientific evidence, i.e. fat quality, protein require- ments, dairy products or whether potatoes (excluding crisps, chips, French fries) count as vegetables. Further, while transparency and independency should be basic prerequisites for the process of developing guidelines, lobbying pressure has been a common criticism.",
    "Ideally, the process of developing recommendations and guidelines should follow standardized protocols using explicit standards for evidence, with the strengths and limitations of the evidence explained in easy- to-understand language. Additionally, responsible bodies and organizations should plan timelines for regularly the emerging updating recommendations in light of evidence.",
    "As an example, fat consumption has decreased over the past decades in many countries, in line with recommendations, but this has not brought about the expected health outcomes. In fact, new problems have emerged: the advised decrease in fat intake may have induced unwanted dietary changes that have contributed to the increase in overweight and obesity.",
    "An adaptation of evidence ratings has been suggested that considers not only the quality of the evidence, but also the net benefit of an intervention(2) - a perspective that also recognizes the potential for harm. Thus, the evidence assessment includes the possibility that no recommendation be made - a possibility intended to provide the appropriate level of caution in issuing guidelines.",
    "This issue of Public Health Nutrition focuses on several studies examining different aspects of dietary recom- mendations and guidelines, from their development to their application. The example of developing and interpreting guidelines for protein intake, expressed as the ratio of protein to energy requirement (P:Erequirement), is described in detail in a commentary by Professor Joe Millward(3). The commentary is an excellent study of how protein requirements and the P:E value for a given diet are properly interpreted, and why the P:Erequirement value might sometimes be lower than one would expect.",
    "Also with respect to developing guidelines, Brown et al.(4) report on European stakeholders' views on consumer involvement in dietary guideline development. Participation is a key principle in health promotion, and it has been argued that people have the right to participate in the planning and implementation of their health care. Since the general public is the intended end-user of dietary guidelines, members of the public, from indivi- dual lay consumers to consumer groups or consumer advocates, could potentially be involved in the process of developing guidelines. Their participation might involve providing qualitative or quantitative consumer research data, or taking part in consultations and decision-making meetings. Brown et al. find that a major benefit of involving consumers might be to increase trust in the process; but given the limited data on best practice for consumer involvement, transparency regarding their role in the process is essential. Other articles deal with the challenge of communicating the message to consumers and encouraging the adoption and implementation of dietary guidelines.",
    "Changing icons, either a pyramid or a plate, have led to growing consumer including popular confusion and claims in the media, bloggers and social media. 'I hated having to think about every little thing I ate in quantitative terms. People aren't machines. We're subjective and pleasure-seeking and messy and crazyy Essentially, the experience made me neurotic and anxious about food (one of my great pleasures!) without making me especially healthy', wrote Joe Satran, blogger at The Huffington Post, in a recent post(5). More structured quantitative guidance and tips for everyday life can be helpful.",
    "However, such guidance should account for different population groups; should consider cultural relevance and the issues of accessibility, affordability, cooking skills and skills to make healthier choices when eating out; and should be based in com- mon eating habits, familiar foods and prevalent food preferences. The toolkit developed by Leslie et al.(6) is a good example of such guidance, while additionally addressing sustainability and encouraging home food preparation. Mithril et al.(7) offer a different approach by developing a regional prototype diet, the New Nordic Diet (NND), which is based largely on foods originating from the Nordic region and also takes palatability, health, food culture and the environment into consideration. In a third article on implementing dietary guidelines, Probst and Tapsell(8) find that, with careful food selection, meal plans with >4 grain-based servings daily can meet nutrient recommendations using lacto-ovo vegetarian and rice-based cuisines, although different strategies are required for different ages and genders.",

    "Genetic strategies are being advanced through a series of overlapping domains that inform the decision making on feasibility, safety, efficacy, and acceptabil- ity. Although the need to focus on science- based regulation using a risk-assessment framework is gaining support [8], there has been a relative lack of attention on broader community regulations that are explicitly or indirectly required to bring a genetics-based product to the field [3,9- 11]. An evidence-based approach would facilitate the integration, efficacy, and acceptability of policy for an intervention strategy.

The constitu- ents in this domain include persons at risk the disease, members of primaryfor healthcare systems, scientists, non-govern- mental organizations, private businesses, and international agencies involved in the detection and analysis of disease. Researchers in the scientific domain work to meet the public health need by developing novel strategies and products.",
    "The task for our Project was to determine whether it is possible to engineer mosqui- toes that carry conditionally lethal genes that would result in the suppression of target vector populations. This involved laboratory development of such strains, analyses of the impact of transgenes on the ecology and population dynamics of natural and engineered populations, and eventually, documenting their safety and efficacy.",
    "Results achieved in the laboratory prior to our contained field trial were encouraging [6,17]. Investigators demon- strated proof of principal for a number of genetically modified lines with specific phenotypes, and efforts were initiated to determine whether laboratory successes could be reproduced in more natural field conditions [12,18-20].",
    "This domain pro- vides part of the evidence base for risk assessment and the technical requirements of the regulatory processes. The regulatory domain addresses tech- nical statutory and contractual obligations and requires the existence of a functional system that has the knowledge, capacity, and authority to review, monitor, and grant permission for research on geneti- cally modified organisms (GMOs) [21]. Laboratory and cage trials, followed by open-field releases, depend on the pres- ence of one or more sanctioned oversight bodies capable of granting the necessary approvals and the ability and capacity of to meet and maintain the researchers compliance with regulatory requirements.",
    "The social domain is less systematized than institutional regulatory processes because it is highly dependent traditions, on cultural technical such as factors practices, and cohesion, as well as other community interactions and structures at local levels.

The domain gener- ates analyses of community attitudes and representations that incorporate cultural and equality issues, key components of community regulatory processes. It also integrates both technical and community- based regulatory processes as outreach that encourages a broad range of people in the community to join the dialogue.

Particular challenges are presented by technologies for which there is little back- ground, experience, or previously devel- oped, to guide the transition from the laboratory to the field.

    "Proponents must simul- taneously develop the science and contrib- ute meaningfully to community dialogue regarding if, when, where, and how it could and should be applied. Part of this process is to meet the legal, technical, and community regulatory requirements for testing and use. Rigorous site-selection procedures identi- fied Mexico as having the necessary capacity to support the first field-cage tests on GMM vectors of dengue [14].",
    "While we do not expect every country to adopt these same requirements, we anticipate that our experience can assist in the planning for future efforts to test these kinds of technol- ogies. Given the early involvement and contri- butions to developing genetically modified plants, Mexico has been a leaderin government regulation and oversight of research, testing, and use of genetics-basedin technology.",
    "As a result, our efforts Mexico were expedited by the presence of three critical regulatory and community features, the combination of which was unique at the time when our Project was initiated. The first was the existence of CIBIOGEM, the federal-level body that oversees the coordinated technical review of the proposed research by all secretariats and agencies expected to have some authority in the process.",
    "Specifically, au- thorities for public health, agriculture, and environment and natural resources are represented in the review process. Thus, questions and concerns of the impact of the research on human and animal health and the environment would have sufficient technical review.",
    "The benefit to the Project from such a structure was that CIBIOGEM was a single, defined body with appropriate expertise to which we could communicate regarding the experimental trial, and through one of the constituent agencies, SEMARNAT, receive the necessary regis- tration and review. factor was The second majorthe presence of a world-class collaborative scientific institution, INSP, and its on-site regional center, CRISP, which contribut- scientists, outreach ed the experience, and management that were expertise, essential for coordinating testing of this new technology.",
    "They also provided the technical and ethical scope of review that was essential for IRBs, IBCs, and animal care and use committees. Special provi- sions applied by INSP for this Project included specific, coordinated discussions of review procedures and the addition of an oversight committee established by the director general. These structures contrib- uted at all levels to the assurance that issues with genetic engineering and ethical engagement of communities were ad- dressed satisfactorily.",
    "The third critical factor arose out of the Mexican agrarian reform, current modifi- cations of original landholding laws, and the collective decision-making processes of the asamblea ejidal. One of the primary impacts of the 1910 Mexican Revolution was to return decision making regarding territorial issues to those who worked and lived on the land.",
    "The resulting reform linked all territorial and community deci- sion making to the collectively adminis- tered ejidos. Recent secondary land reform provides the opportunity for collectively owned ejidos to permit land privatization and sale, and this has contributed to a recent shift from total collective ownership to privatization. Because collective com- munity decisions are dependent on the asamblea ejidal, they too are currently immersed in an evolutionary process, shifting from traditional, patriarchal deci- sion making by the ejidatarios to the more modern, vertical, political party and public administration structures. Both traditional and modern public administration deci- sion making are operating concurrently, level.",
    "However, the especially at a local asamblea ejidal, because of its historic acceptability, is still considered in many rural communities to be the key commu- nity regulatory body. Community approv-",
    "al was necessary for INSP to acquire land for the trial, and part of the deliberative process prior to granting permission was for the INSP and the Project to commu- nicate its intentions for initial as well as future use. Thus, the asamblea potential ejidal was an integrating entity for all regulatory components at the local level. Importantly, their permission to sell the community the criteria of land met consent and was taken as an explicit approval for Project activities. The philosophical approach ofthe scientific group developing GMMs will influence how a project interfaces with the multiple political and economic forces that drive outreach and public dialogue at a national level and the community regula- tory processes at a local level.",
    "While there is clear leadership and appropriate processes regarding technical regulatory procedures at the federal level, this is not the case for community regulatory processes. We ex- pect that finding analogous structures for collective decision making in other coun- tries will be difficult, but this highlights the need to tailor testing and development of novel genetic strategies to all levels of each society, their many communities, and according to the particular public health and environmental context. The organized coordination of civil, sanitary, legal, environmental, community, experimental and administrative compo- nents of field testing GMOs will likely have phases of discovery, development, and scale-up.",
    "We can expect that processes will include iterations and adjustments. Add to this the global nature of such a project, with financing and stakeholders having multiple national, cultural, scientific, and institution- al experiences, norms, and perspectives, and the testing of a novel genetic-based technology can quickly become a complex process. Therefore, a project designed to test the public health potential of geneti- cally modified products requires careful attention at all levels to continuous, open, and proactive communication.",
    "Information exchange and dialogue should be transpar- ent. There should be recognition and participation by all community members, which will lead to increased confidence and mutual respect among the community and institutional efficiency, adaptability, and compliance.the experiences of those who embraced these complex regulatory challenges will contrib- ute to increasingly more effective technical and community approval and, ultimately, disease prevention.",

    "Abstract Background: The pan-European VACCELERATE network aims to implement the first transnational harmonized and sustainable vaccine trial Volunteer Registry, being a single entry point for potential volunteers of large-scale vaccine trials across Europe. This work exhibits a set of harmonized vaccine trial-related educational and promotional tools for the general public, designed and disseminated by the pan-European VACCELERATE network. Objective:",
    "This study primarily aimed to design and develop a standard toolkit to increase positive attitudes and access to trustworthy information for better access and increased recruitment to vaccine trials for the public. More specifically, the produced tools are focused on inclusiveness and equity, and are targeting different population groups, including underserved ones, as potential volunteers for the VACCELERATE Volunteer Registry (older individuals, migrants, children, and adolescents). The promotional and educational material is aligned with the main objectives of the Volunteer Registry to increase public literacy and awareness regarding vaccine-related clinical research or trials and trial participation, including informed consent and legal issues, side effects, and frequently asked questions regarding vaccine trial design. Methods: Tools were developed per the aims and principles of the VACCELERATE project, focusing on trial inclusiveness and equity, and are adjusted to local country-wise requirements to improve public health communication. The produced tools are selected based on the cognitive theory, inclusiveness, and equity of differently aged and underrepresented groups, and standardized material from several official trustworthy sources (eg, COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access; the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control; the European Patients' Academy on Therapeutic Innovation; Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; and the World Health Organization).",
    "A team of multidisciplinary specialists (infectious diseases, vaccine research, medicine, and education) edited and reviewed the subtitles and scripts of the educational videos, extended brochures, interactive cards, and puzzles. Graphic designers selected the color palette, audio settings, and dubbing for the video story-tales and implemented QR codes.",
    "Results: This study presents the first set of harmonized promotional and educational materials and tools (ie, educational cards, educational and promotional videos, extended brochures, flyers, posters, and puzzles) for vaccine clinical research (eg, COVID-19 vaccines). These tools inform the public about possible benefits and disadvantages of trial participation and build confidence among participants about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and the health care system. This material has been translated into several languages and is intended to be freely and easily accessible to facilitate dissemination among VACCELERATE network participant countries and the European and global scientific, industrial, and public community. Conclusions: The produced material could help fill knowledge gaps of health care personnel, providing the appropriate future patient education for vaccine trials, and tackling vaccine hesitancy and parents' concerns for potential participation of children in vaccine trials.",

    "[1] is an independent, innovative, and transparent Pan-European academic network with the aim of initiatives and harmonizing multinational vaccine conducting capacity mapping of vaccine clinical trials sites and laboratories with standardized methods and protocols across Europe. The network identifies and provides access to state-of-the-art vaccine trial sites to accelerate the development of vaccines and recruit volunteers for vaccine trials through the VACCELERATE Volunteer Registry",
    "[2]. trial the first to establish transnational harmonized The main goal of the VACCELERATE Volunteer Registry [2] trialis participation platform serving as single entry point for the European region. The VACCELERATE Volunteer Registry",
    "[2], under the mandate of the European Union's Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA) [3], provides a sustainable platform source for the recruitment of potential volunteers for clinical studies for the current COVID-19 pandemic and future epidemics. According to the literature, one of the main challenges of a volunteer registry is the registration of a large number of potential trial participants with great diversity [4,5] and dedication in order to be able to recruit and match suitable candidates for the selected clinical trial.",
    "Therefore, a great amount of effort is spent looking for strategies to improve communication [6] and convince [7] potential volunteers to take part in vaccine trials. The enrollment of volunteers in vaccine trials is also influenced by factors such as complacency, conspiracy theories [8] on social media regarding COVID-19, convenience and confidence (the \"Three Cs\" model of vaccine hesitancy)",
    "[7,9], disinformation [10], fake news [11], fear [12], and increasing level of health misinformation [13-15].",
    "The latter leads to an infodemic [16] of misleading information with immediate effects on public health, refusal, and vaccine hesitancy [9] for participation in clinical trials [17,18]. It should be noted that health misinformation is responsible for increased fear and lack of trust, which are major factors for enrollment also in cancer clinical trials [19-21]. Recently, Luis et al [22] reported that there is a lack of public information about COVID-19 vaccine trials among several population groups (eg, minorities and underrepresented populations or individuals), while the available tools for trial participation were also sparse.",
    "The main purpose of this study is the design and development of a standardized toolkit based on the Social Cognitive Theory [23,24] to increase positive attitudes, access to trustworthy information for better access and increased recruitment to vaccine trials. Our secondary objective is to foster engagement of the community through the VACCELERATE Volunteer Registry and smart technology for participating in forthcoming clinical trials",
    "[25-28]. The VACCELERATE toolkit has been translated into several languages and is freely and easily accessible to facilitate dissemination among the participating countries of the VACCELERATE Consortium [1].",
    "the tools included following steps: The development of the VACCELERATE educational and promotional (1) conceptualization of the idea and context based on the selected educational aims and objectives; (2) selection of targeted population groups (eg, older individuals, children, adolescents, and minorities); (3) prioritization of trustworthy sources and websites for seeking information about COVID-19 vaccine trials for the developed materials; (4) performing graphical design (eg, visualization, audio, product, print, and animation design); and (5) acquisition of a digital object identifier (DOI) for each produced material from a DOI registration agency. More details on the developed tools are presented in the Results section. The context of the educational and promotional tools was created and reviewed by a group of experts in the field of infectious diseases and vaccine and pedagogical research.",
    "Two graphic designers developed and selected the appropriate color palette and audio (music, speaker voice, and dubbing) for the video story-tales and they adapted the produced material into an efficient pedagogical, attractive, and eye-catching way. The developed tools were (1) icons related to the COVID-19 pandemic (eg, use of a face mask, syringe, microscope, vaccine, handwashing, virus, etc); (2) different versions of logotypes for the VACCELERATE project; (3) typefaces; (4) samples of fonts with different sizes; (5) color palettes (primary and secondary colors); (6) imagery templates and guidelines for social media (eg, Twitter and Instagram); (7) human characters (ie, medical staff, minorities, and older individuals) as prototypes for any future VACCELERATE promotional and or educational material. Special attention was also paid to foster inclusiveness among the characters (different age groups, different ethic and other minority groups, citizens with disabilities, migrants, etc).",
    "The provided tools also include QR codes with a URL. The selected URL can be a website (as shown on the VACCELERATE website [29]) or selected animation videos from trustworthy sources of information (eg, COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access",
    "[ie, COVAX]; the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control; the European Patients' Academy on Therapeutic Innovation; the European Vaccine Initiative; Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund; and the World Health Organization). In addition, the produced puzzles test memory in a team-based manner and help develop hand-eye coordination. Finally, the developed tools have been designed in a such a way that can be adjusted in accordance with local country-wise requirements and requirements to build confidence among participants about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and the health care system, which is a key parameter to improve recruitment among minority communities.",

    "Argyropoulos et al Results VACCELERATE Flyers The flyers (see Multimedia Appendix 1) provide the appropriate amount of information to the public regarding the registration process and the VACCELERATE Volunteer Registry in general. The flyers are A3-sized (29.7x43.18 cm) and include a short description of the VACCELERATE Volunteer Registry objectives and volunteer selection process.",
    "In addition, they contain the appropriate contact details (email ID) and link (along with a QR code) for registration in the Volunteer Registry [30]. The registration link directs the interested volunteer to a brief survey (which takes 5-10 minutes to complete) that collects comprehensive information required for clinical trials. The flyer invites all citizens to register, including those with prior COVID-19 vaccination, with specific questions regarding COVID-19 infection, and the invitations to eligible volunteers for future vaccine trials will be sent out by the Coordination Office of VACCELERATE (University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany).",
    "Finally, the flyers have been translated into 9 languages (Cypriot Greek, English, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish). VACCELERATE Posters The developed posters (see Multimedia Appendix 1) are A0-sized (84.1x118.9 cm) and depict human characters (ie, medical staff, minorities, and older individuals, among others) and a QR code including a URL for the VACCELERATE Volunteer Registry website [30], as well as catchy slogans such as \"Be the missing piece\" and \"Together we can tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.\" Finally, the posters have been translated into 7 languages, namely English, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, and Spanish, in collaboration with individual partners and national coordinators of the VACCELERATE Consortium.

    "The VACCELERATE puzzles (Multimedia Appendix 1) were developed using graphic techniques under the guidance of the VACCELERATE participants, including a pediatrician, with focus on younger children (aged <12 years) in order to raise their awareness of clinical trials, vaccines, and participation in https://publichealth.jmir.org/2023/1/e44491 XSL*FO RenderX trials and to promote inclusiveness. The link to the produced puzzles is provided in Multimedia Appendix 1. One of the developed puzzles comprises 25 pieces and depicts a variety of human characters (ie, medical staff, minorities, older individuals, and children, among others) obtained from the VACCELERATE toolkit, including the appropriate link to the VACCELERATE Volunteer Registry [30].",

    "Argyropoulos et al is to include as many human characters as possible to highlight the importance of inclusiveness and diversity in vaccine trials, especially for underserved population groups such as racial and ethnic minorities and older individuals. The other 2 smaller puzzles (8 pieces each) were developed to familiarize children with symbols and icons related to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to understand and recognize the effectiveness of vaccines in minimizing the risk of infection and harmful effects of COVID-19.",
    "VACCELERATE Animation Videos Educational Videos (Adult and Pediatric) The first produced educational video (see Multimedia Appendix 1) was mainly focused on adults and designed using advanced animation techniques, appropriate subtitles based on a storyboard and educational aims, and audio settings (eg, music and a speaker voice). In addition, the video included the following sections: (1) highlight and increase information regarding clinical trials and their necessity and usefulness for public health (eg, good clinical practices, vaccine trial phases and monitoring, and applied safety protocols); (2) the contribution of volunteers (ie, citizens, patient advocacy groups, and underserved populations) to this effort for capacity mapping and building of registries; and (3) volunteer safety, benefits, and any potential risks during a clinical trial.",
    "The second educational video (see Multimedia Appendix 1) was mainly aimed at children and adolescents. Special attention was given to contain informative animations while delivering the learning aim and keeping each video segment short. The produced video included the following sections: (1) provide information about the significance of vaccine trials; (2) share knowledge and information about the high value of vaccination as the most powerful \"weapon\" to prevent morbidity and mortality associated with infectious diseases; (3) acknowledge the advancements in technology and safety procedures, which have contributed significantly to the development, evaluation, approval, and monitoring of safe and effective vaccines; and (4) highlight the contribution and importance of pediatric volunteers in vaccine clinical trials and ensure their safety and the benefits and risks of participating in clinical trials.",
    "Promotional Video The promotional video (see Multimedia Appendix 1) presents short, recorded videos by the VACCELERATE work package leaders and the National Coordinator's pictures to promote, inform, and describe the VACCELERATE Volunteer Registry through specific text scripts. The aim of the video is the inclusiveness and representation of all participating European Union countries and European Union-associated countries of the VACCELERATE Consortium. Currently, we have active representation from 17 countries (Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Hungary, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and Turkey) in the VACCELERATE Volunteer Registry. https://publichealth.jmir.org/2023/1/e44491 XSL*FO RenderX Discussion Principal Findings This paper presents the first set of harmonized promotional and educational tools of the VACCELERATE Volunteer Registry",
    "[2]. The produced material, based on the selected population group, includes flyers, posters, interactive educational cards, puzzles, and animation videos. The tools can be downloaded from the official website of VACCELERATE [29] and appropriate references, based on their own DOIs.",
    "It should be noted that the provided educational material can be adopted to the user needs and may also be used as base-prototypes for further improvement and production of related tools. To ensure high rates of vaccination in populations [31] and a large number of participants in vaccine trials, it is necessary to ensure effective, targeted, and trustworthy educational and promotional tools regarding vaccines and vaccine trials, guaranteeing high diversity and inclusiveness in vaccine trials without underrepresentation of minorities. The developed standardized toolkit is one example of information from trustful sources that can be used against health misinformation and disinformation, lack of trust, fear, and fake news. Furthermore, it can be also used to increase literacy and understanding of the importance of vaccine clinical trials in the general population as part of an emergency preparedness plan. In addition, the promotional and educational material will be able to bridge the gap in public information (eg, communication approach, target audiences, and type of media produced) regarding COVID-19 vaccine trials, which is covered in only 2.51% of the collected media and only in 4 languages (English, French, German, and Czech)",
    "[22]. Another challenge is using visual material and stories in order to inform children about the procedures, importance of, and volunteer participation in vaccine trials and about vaccination. Limitations The impact and assessment of the promotional and educational material are beyond the scope of this study.",
    "Nevertheless, we are currently in the process of evaluating them for vaccine trials during this year by another expert group (WP4) of the VACCELERATE Consortium. Conclusions Communicating with trustworthy information to the public, related to public health issues and vaccine research or trials, constitutes the most important preventive strategy against infectious diseases and threats of future emerging infection diseases. Future initiatives could involve further improvement of the dissemination process for the developed tools in order to increase the number of volunteer registrations and in particular among population groups, which remain underrepresented in vaccine trials.",
    "Another initiative could be the design of an innovative video game [31,32] targeting training and educational material for vaccine clinical trials, addressing vaccine hesitancy and refusal.",
    "JMIR Public Health Surveill 2023 | vol. 9 | e44491 | p. 5 (page number not for citation purposes) JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE",
    "Argyropoulos et al Other prospective initiatives could be the conduct of studies based on citizen science methods (eg, community-based participatory action research [28]) for vaccine research [25-27,33] and future epidemics by engaging community members and service providers as partners in the research process and providing them the appropriate educational tools for tackling current and future public health issues. Such actions will eventually contribute to reduce the knowledge gaps and hesitancy regarding participation in vaccine trials in the general population.",

As part of this ongoing effort, a series of meetings sponsored by DHS were held at the Banbury Center of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, to address specific issues for the enhancement of microbial forensic capability. One such meeting, held on 16 to 19 October 2005, focused on the col- lection, handling, and storage of samples.",
    "These issues had been identified at previous meetings (5, 6) as some of the most critical issues confronting a crime scene investigation and sub- sequent analysis of evidence. The participants represented di- verse scientific entities within academia, the private sector, the national laboratories, and several federal agencies (Central Intelligence Agency, Centers for Disease Control and Preven- tion, DHS, FBI, Food and Drug Administration, and U.S. Department of Agriculture), some of which have been involved in evidence collection for purposes related to forensics, public health, or plant and animal health.",

    "When it is overt, law enforcement (i.e., the FBI, which has the lead investigative role by authority) controls the investigation and works closely with public health author- ities as appropriate. If it is covert, law enforcement may not be involved immediately.",
    "In some cases, the lag time for law enforcement involvement may be substantial. As is true for any crime investigation, this lag time could hamper opportunities to collect meaningful evidence.",
    "In either situation, there are many plausible crime scene investigative scenarios, ranging from searching a clandestine laboratory to identifying and con- taining a canister found in a subway. The response to a biocrime or bioterrorist event can be divided into the activities carried out by first responders and the activities performed by hazardous material crime scene investigators.",
    "First responders may include health care work- ers, firefighters, police, paramedics, hazardous material per- sonnel, veterinarians, or even concerned citizens.",
    "In a covert attack, some of the evidence, such as medical histories, clinical samples, and tissue samples collected by an attending physi- cian, a medical examiner, or coroner, is likely to be collected prior to law enforcement involvement (33). Crime scene inves- tigators usually follow first responders or a surveillance team that has gathered some preliminary information about the event. Thus, investigators who arrive to collect forensic evi- dence likely already have some prior knowledge about the crime scene.",
    "This knowledge should be used during the pre- operational planning phase of a crime scene investigation, but it should not be used alone. Planning is requisite.",
    "For most bioterrorism cases, a detailed operational plan describing a strategy for the initial sampling, collection, and transport of evidence should be developed. The plan usually involves a focused search and collection process based on reasonable assumptions about the event.",
    "Preparatory work is essential because of the hazardous, chaotic, or even life-threatening environment presented to crime scene investigators. Investiga- tors may have to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) (1) that limits mobility, the time available to work at the scene, and flexibility.",
    "Thus, crime scene investigators should plan, organize, and anticipate practices that facilitate the collection and handling of microbial forensic evidence on a timely and sometimes time-constrained basis. The goal of a hazardous material crime scene investigator is to obtain sufficient biological agent and associated materials, when available, to support a meaningful analytical investiga- tion for species and strain (and substrain) identification or for toxin identification. The biological agent itself, however, is not the only forensic evidence to consider.",
    "Related chemical and physical signatures, including by-products, and traditional fo- rensic evidence, such as fingerprints, computer records, and trace evidence, can provide clues to the identity of the individ- ual(s) who committed the crime. Where to sample, the method of sampling, and how many samples to collect are important considerations to obtain the right type, quantity, and quality of data to support attribution. Furthermore, it is essential to maintain the integrity of the evidence, to the extent possible, from the time of collection and during subsequent storage; otherwise, crucial and reliable forensic information can be lost.",
    "Traditional basic crime scene investigation strategies apply to cases of bioterrorism or biocrimes (39). The first priorities are the care of victims (33) and the potential public health risks. The next priority is securing the crime scene. The event or suspected event may involve more than one scene, and determination of a scene and its extent may be difficult.",
    "Then coordination discussions should be held, in which law enforce- ment, public (or agricultural) health, and Environmental Pro- tection Agency officials discuss their roles and capabilities in dealing with a biological attack, whether it is overt or covert. These discussions should include the best methods for the collection and handling of evidence, collection of specimens to assess the level of contamination in order to guide public health (or agricultural) investigations and restoration and re- covery activities, and the proper PPE to use. Restoration and recovery activities to mitigate public health concerns (e.g., de- contamination of facilities) should not occur until forensic evidence is collected for law enforcement purposes. SAMPLE COLLECTION",
    "The inherent rigidity in a standard operating protocol (SOP) for crime scene processing could be unwieldy and impractical in a bioterrorism event or biocrime, possibly even compromis- ing evidence collection in some cases. Therefore, consultation among the different entities involved in a response should provide best-practice options framed on established guidelines (45).",
    "The plan can be modified after greater scrutiny of the crime scene or as more information is obtained during the course of the investigation. The participants emphasized that it is not possible or even desirable to prepare a single, defined SOP (or even a number of them) to process the many possible crime scenes that may be encountered.",
    "However, lack of a specific SOP should not pre- clude attempts to collect critical evidence. If the forensic situ- ation fits a pattern or template for which a sample collection methodology and/or sampling strategy already has been vali- dated, then the sampling activities could be well-defined and more focused. However, in most microbial forensic cases, the sampling area, location, type of agent, substrates, and combi- nations of these variables are almost always novel.",
    "This may be particularly true for trace evidence. Indeed, some flexibility in the sampling processes must be allowed, because every crime scene is different and the variability of the presentation of microbiological evidence can be immense. Moreover, the sam- pling requirements for microbes or DNA evidence are likely to be completely different than those for different toxins.",
    "Perhaps the best and most widely accepted approach for development of a sampling strategy in a particular case is to follow established guiding principles (for crime scene investi- gations) in combination with expert knowledge, including mi- crobiological and biochemical knowledge, investigative experi- ence, and common sense. Even without a prescribed sampling tool or methodology, sometimes innovation or intuitive means may be necessary as it is preferable to attempt to collect evi- dence rather than to ignore the evidence altogether. The op- erational sample collection strategy should accommodate the VOL. 72, 2006 MINIREVIEW 6433 uncertainty about the evidence being collected. However, when a novel or modified approach is used, all steps and the information accrued must be well documented for future ref- erence and scrutiny.",
    "The agencies involved in the investigation of buildings po- tentially contaminated with anthrax spores via the mail (38) determined that the best chance of recovering evidence for forensic analysis (as well as for determining an initial public health risk) was to focus on areas likely to be exposed to spores (36). A targeted sampling strategy is the appropriate approach and should be considered first when a biological agent is sus- pected or when information on the source of a potential biolog- ical agent is available. The targeted approach should not be con- fused with remediation sampling strategies, which are different than the sampling strategies used for crime scene investigations (see the discussion about the Government Accountability Office",
    "[GAO] report below). A defined approach allows maximum suc- cess in retrieving evidence, especially when the conditions for collection are hazardous or time constrained, as well as utilization of limited resources as effectively as possible. Evidence may be collected by three general approaches.",
    "One approach is to collect the whole item and transport it to a properly dedicated biocontainment facility, previously shown to be free of contaminating biothreat agent signatures, for further sampling and analysis. This approach minimizes the time required for evidence collection, which is important when investigators are wearing PPE. Makeshift certified facilities may be designated for very large pieces of evidence, and the NBFAC facility may be used to accommodate smaller pieces of evidence.",
    "Once evidence is transferred to a secure location, more vigorous evaluation and detailed sampling can be con- ducted in a controlled environment under appropriate biocon- tainment conditions. However, some items may be too large or too bulky to be removed from the crime scene, the items may not be accommodated in a controlled laboratory setting, or there may be some concern about loss of trace evidence during transport.",
    "When the whole item cannot be recovered, an in- vestigator can remove a portion of the item (this approach includes vacuuming, filtration, and/or water sample collection). Lastly, an approach that is particularly useful for collecting trace materials is swabbing or wiping materials or surfaces with appropriate sample collection devices. Sample collection devices include dry swabs, premoistened swabs, wipes, high-efficiency particulate air vacuums and fil- ters, and aspirating needles (7-9, 21, 31).",
    "Substantial experience exists within various government agencies, clinical microbiology, the Laboratory Response Network (19), and veterinary and ag- riculture practices (7, 12, 21, 35, 46) for guidance concerning the approach to use in a given situation. However, there are three major concerns regarding the use of sampling methods and collection devices.",
    "First, some of the methods and sam- pling devices have not been rigorously validated. It is not known which method and device yield the best collection effi- ciency or provide the best recovery of physical, chemical, and/or biological signatures. In some cases, sufficient material may not be available for sampling during an investigation even though adequate material may have been present at the crime scene.",
    "The assumptions made by crime scene investigators are more limited if the efficiency of the collection method is un- known. Second, a number of methods have been validated, but current security restrictions may hinder sharing the validation data between agencies. Thus, data on best practices, as well as data on practices that do not perform well, may exist but are not available to all workers who need them.",
    "Third, one should have a general understanding of the analyte or target signature that will be analyzed, and the collection method should be tailored appropriately. This is not an easy task for microbial forensics practitioners because of the uncertainty associated with each case, the diversity of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and toxins, and the stability of analytes, such as nucleic acids or proteins.",
    "What may be reasonable for collecting one microor- ganism might be deleterious for another (33). Also, what may solubilize one toxin may be ineffectual for recovering another toxin (35).",
    "Even differences in the background matrix carrying the evidence material may warrant changes in the sampling strategy. Thus, in some scenarios it might be good practice to collect multiple samples and use several different preservation modalities to accommodate different analytical schemes (see recommendations below for a strategy to begin to address the major concerns for sampling). The methods and devices for evidence collection must be validated with regard to subsequent analytical processes.",
    "Con- sider a scenario in which a crime scene investigator uses a swab with a 15-cm diameter to collect evidence over large surface areas. Although validation testing shows that such a swab is effective for collecting microorganisms, most if not all diagnos- tic and analytical laboratories cannot accommodate such a large swab for sample processing (e.g., extraction of nucleic acids). This exaggerated example stresses the point that vali- dation should be designed with consideration of the entire process from collection to analysis.",
    "Other examples to consider for DNA-based analyses are chemicals inherent in the swab material that copurify with DNA and/or environmental impu- rities such as metal ions or organic compounds that may pref- erentially bind to the swab during collection and may inhibit the PCR. Alternatively, swabs may contain soluble components that may be either cytotoxic for cell culture systems used to recover viruses or inhibitory for the growth of certain bacteria in culture. Some materials designed to preserve a particular pathogen may impact negatively on the analytical assay. In the clinical laboratory, specimens containing bacteria tend to be delivered in general transport media (e.g., Amies or Stuarts) that contain some nutrients to maintain viability.",
    "Viral transport media usually consist of solutions such as phosphate-buffered sucrose or Hanks balanced salt solution with bovine serum albumin and some antibiotics to retard bacterial growth. Many com- mercial PCR or antigen detection kits provide proprietary transport media that have been designed to stabilize the ana- lyte in question. There also are some general transport solu- tions for collection of samples for PCR analysis that lyse the bacteria or viruses and stabilize the nucleic acids (13, 18, 29).",
    "The media generally used to collect and transport animal pathogens also were developed primarily to preserve proteins, nucleic acids, and pathogen viability. The stability of some animal viruses (e.g., foot-and-mouth disease virus) is markedly affected by pH and ionic strength.",
    "One of the most commonly used transport media is buffered tryptose broth. Buffered glyc- erin, internationally used to transport vesicular disease speci- mens, has been shown to preserve the causative virus at room MINIREVIEW APPL.",
    "temperature for long periods of time. This medium is not used in the United States and has not been thoroughly tested for PCR inhibition.",
    "Glycerol, at different concentrations, may in- activate certain viruses while preserving others in clinical sam- ples (25, 41, 42). A possible criterion for selecting an adequate collection and transport medium for viruses of agricultural concern could be the use of isotonic solutions with neutral pH (23). Additional guidance for collection of virus specimens can be found at http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza /guidelines/humanspecimens/en/. The number and intricacies of the areas under consideration emphasize the need for extensive training and knowledge to allow flexibility in the development of sampling strategies that are best suited for each set of circumstances.",
    "PACKAGING, TRANSPORT, AND STORAGE Obtaining an analytical result also can be affected by the manner and conditions under which a specimen is transported and stored. The same concerns discussed above with respect to sample collection also apply to packaging and transportation.",
    "Storage conditions differ for some microorganisms. For exam- ple, anaerobes die when they are exposed to ambient levels of oxygen during storage and therefore cannot be recovered upon anaerobic culture (28).",
    "The packaging or storage conditions required for a given microorganism also may differ depending on the sample matrix or physical condition (e.g., liquid versus powder). When there are copious quantities of microbial fo- rensic evidence, some loss may be inconsequential, and various packaging and storage strategies can be applied.",
    "However, trace materials are very limited, and at times collection of only one sample may be possible. In such scenarios, efforts to main- tain the integrity of the sample are more demanding and crit- ical. The packaging, transportation, and storage conditions should be related to preserving the analyte or signature to be analyzed.",
    "Clinical medicine has well-developed packaging, transport, and storage protocols (15, 16, 27, 37). Each specimen is trans- ported in a package appropriate for the suspected microorgan- ism and the type of specimen collected. Packaging for most routine pathogens and the pathogens on the select agent list (2) is defined, and the likely clinical specimens in which they reside are known (11). Commercial products are available for transporting clinical specimens.",
    "Transport packages designed for most bacteria are not adequate if a viral etiology is sus- pected. Specimens for culture should be transported to the laboratory as promptly as possible.",
    "Transport strategies that minimize damage, loss, contamination, or exposure to person- nel are necessary (43). Some specimens can be transported at room temperature, and some should be transported on ice (see reference 44 for some recommended conditions).",
    "Most speci- mens should be stored refrigerated to maintain viability, pre- serve relative proportions, and minimize overgrowth of con- taminants (blood is an important exception and should not be refrigerated). Many commercial clinical laboratories have de- veloped efficient and effective methods for defining transport media and appropriate temperatures for particular classes of microbes. The volumes of samples prescribed for analysis allow for extra material, so evaluations can often be made when the sample is \"improperly\" transported.",
    "Under certain circum- stances, the collection of a specimen for microbial forensics is more like the collection of a cerebrospinal fluid sample (14, 34) or a surgical biopsy from a patient where it may be difficult or impossible to obtain a second sample. Because it may be dif- ficult to predict the optimal transport materials or process, a variety of options should be made available to crime scene investigators, and there should be consultation with experts, when possible, prior to packaging. For food or plant materials, the recommended packaging and storage practices are similar to those used in clinical mi- crobiology and have been well described (22).",
    "Sampling and sample plans for foods are discussed in detail elsewhere (17). Such methods depend on the nature of the food (e.g., whether it is a solid, semisolid, or liquid; the storage conditions [i.e., whether it is frozen, refrigerated, or at ambient temperature], and the type of packaging, if any, ensuring integrity of the food product). To minimize amplification during transport or stor- age, when possible, the sample should be maintained dry, fro- zen, or at least chilled.",
    "However, some microorganisms may be harmed if they are frozen. Buffered glycerol has been used to minimize injury due to freezing and thawing (24). Methods that do not cause significant decreases in the viabilities of specific organisms improve typing success (30).",
    "If an act of bioterrorism were perpetrated against agricul- tural targets, sampling of crops and environmental materials would be required. Samples of plant tissues or associated ma- terials, such as insects, nematodes, soil, or water, should be collected directly into a container with minimal contact. In the field, plant tissues are usually placed dry into paper or plastic bags and stored on ice until they can be refrigerated or pro- cessed. In some cases, adding a small amount of sterile glycerol to the plastic bag may delay tissue desiccation and preserve pathogen signatures.",
    "Plastic sandwich box humidity chambers can maintain humidity without directly wetting plant tissues or insects. Masses of fungal hyphae or spores and bacterial ooze have been collected from plant surfaces or soil into sealable containers containing sterile water, a mild phosphate buffer (3), or 70% ethanol depending on the type of analysis to be performed.",
    "Some microorganisms (e.g., bacterial ring rot, which can survive for 2 to 5 years in dried slime on equipment, burlap sacks, etc.) can survive without stringent storage condi- tions (32). Long-term storage of forensic microbial samples prior to analysis is often necessary; however, long-term storage conditions have not been well defined. Optimal storage condi- tions (freezing versus refrigeration or lyophilization, humidity, storage media) and sample longevities have been determined for only a few plant pathogens.",
    "While some of the practices described above apply in gen- eral to collection of forensic samples, many times samples are collected from the environment surrounding a crime scene. In such cases, the state of the agent should be considered. For example, cooling of dry material may produce condensation that could alter its physical state and possibly interfere with subsequent analysis.",
    "As a general practice, collected samples are placed into sterile containers using dedicated sterile col- lection tools. The samples are then placed into prelabeled translucent ziplock bags for secondary containment and main- tained at ambient temperature. A ziplock bag used as either primary or secondary containment for contaminated physical evidence may be contaminated during sample collection.",
    "VOL. 72, 2006 MINIREVIEW 6435 Therefore, the exterior of sample containers should be decon- taminated. The protocols for packaging and transporting sam- ples to laboratories for analysis are based on federal regula- tions designed to avoid inadvertent release of infectious substances (12). However, for forensic analyses, maintaining the integrity and authenticity of samples from the point of collection is paramount, and following minimal transport reg- ulations may not be adequate.",
    "There is a need to validate transport and storage methods for as many agents and analytes of concern as possible. In addition, because remaining evi- dence should be made available to the defense for retesting, if desired, proper long-term storage conditions have to be vali- dated.",
    "GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE REPORT It is important to draw distinctions between investigations designed to gather microbial forensic evidence and investiga- tions designed to determine whether a pathogen is still present, perhaps after a remediation effort.",
    "A recent GAO report pro- vided recommendations concerned predominantly with reme- diation. However, some important areas of overlap with evi- dence collection for law enforcement purposes are instructive.",
    "The GAO report (40) addressed and was consistent with many of the issues discussed at the recent conference. The scientists in attendance generally agreed with and supported the findings of the GAO report in that validation of methods and processes was deemed necessary to achieve best practices.",
    "However, the conference attendees cautioned that the sampling strategy ad- vocated by the authors of the GAO report for postremediation analysis should not be extrapolated to, nor is it the best ap- proach for, microbial forensic or initial public health and ag- ricultural health investigations. The GAO report was critical of the targeted sampling strat- egy used to detect Bacillus anthracis in postal facilities in 2001. In this instance, government agencies collected samples where, in their best judgment, B. anthracis spores would most likely be found.",
    "The GAO report suggested that the use of a random and/or probability sampling strategy would allow determina- tion of a level of statistical confidence for the absence of building contamination in cases when all sampling results are negative. As noted above, the report apparently pertains to remediation and the decision of when to consider a building safe for reoccupation. Whereas such verification sampling may be necessary to confirm decontamination of a building (10), it should not be confused with the different requirements of microbial forensics.",
    "FORENSIC SAMPLING STRATEGY In clinical and agricultural diagnoses, sampling is prioritized based on location, the type and extent of symptoms, prior knowledge based on sound principles, and the materials avail- able rather than randomly across the body of an infected in- dividual, a field, or any location. Likewise, it would not be productive for most forensic or clinical investigations to use a randomized sample collection strategy. For example, if a pa- tient presents with fever, difficulty with breathing, and a pro- ductive cough but no headache or stiff neck, a physician would likely obtain a sputum sample to search for a possible micro- bial etiology rather than randomly gather samples that include a lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid or collect gastroin- testinal samples to look for parasites.",
    "Similarly, fever, head- ache, and a stiff neck would direct the physician to consider meningitis as the diagnosis and target sampling to the cerebro- spinal fluid to determine if an infection was present. For in- vestigations involving plants, if necrotic lesions are present, it is best to obtain samples from the lesion edges, where living plant tissue supports active pathogen growth.",
    "Certain specialized pathogen structures, such as the galls of smut fungi or the tumors produced by the crown gall bacterium, may be collected directly. In a food poisoning case, consumption of a food may be epidemiologically associated with illness resulting from con- tamination with a food-borne pathogen. To identify the micro- organism, it would be more effective to collect samples from the individuals who became ill than to collect samples from randomly selected individuals in the population.",
    "In one exam- ple of a food-borne outbreak that involved a targeted investi- gation (and subsequent reexamination), strawberries were as- sociated initially with development of illness in a number of people. Although the cause was subsequently shown to be Cyclospora cayetanensis, a gastrointestinal agent found in rasp- berries from Guatemala (20), targeted sampling was clearly advantageous in collecting the most informative samples.",
    "Sim- ilarly, the presence of castor beans or bean mash at a crime scene, or even access to internet records, would suggest the use of directed sampling methods for the collection of suspected ricin. Just as a clinical investigation or a food-borne illness investigation should use the patient history, physical examina- tion, and blood work to direct sampling, a forensic investiga- tion should use available information to guide sampling.",
    "In other words, procedures that would have the highest diagnostic yield are given priority. Certain factors can diminish the likelihood of a positive finding with samples.",
    "Using food-borne contamination as an example, these factors include increased time from contami- nation to sampling, uneven dispersal of the pathogen in the contaminated food, a very large volume of food to be sampled, large batch size, short shelf life of the food, rapid turnaround of implicated foods, and incorrect linkage between the food and illness. These factors suggest that a sampling regimen targeted to only the implicated food(s), its most probable source(s), or the site(s) of origin for similar foods is the pre- ferred sampling approach.",
    "Despite the clear utility of targeted sampling in forensic (and epidemiologic) investigations, statistically derived or random sampling strategies may be useful sometimes. Although statis- tically derived or random sampling strategies have not been used routinely in the forensic sciences, it may be necessary in some instances to understand sample-to-sample variability when workers try to compare other factors across the environ- ment. An application to forensics would be collecting back- ground samples for determination of endemicity, when large areas or quantities (e.g., shipments of a particular crop) need to be sampled to look for a possible contaminant, or for sur- veillance.",
    "In this respect, biogeographic considerations of microbial pathogens also are important; the theories and em- pirical observations regarding biogeography may provide im- portant clues as to the endemicity or introduction of the spe- cific pathogen identified during the investigation (26). MINIREVIEW APPL. ENVIRON.",
    "MICROBIOL. The sampling strategy employed should take into account the a priori knowledge about the crime scene, the science available for characterizing the pathogen being sampled, the different effects on recovery, the different surfaces that may require specific sampling regimens, the microorganisms sam- pled that might be viable but noncultivatable under the con- ditions used for sampling, the possibility of different physio- logical states of an organism (e.g., biofilm formation), and other signatures (e.g., additives, stabilizers, morphology, and isotopes) that may be forensically informative.",
    "If a bioterror- ism event is suspected to have occurred within a building, several scenarios may be plausible. The release point may be easily traced to a specific container or visibly contaminated small area. Alternatively, the exact location of the release may be unknown, but there may be evidence (e.g., victims and disturbed areas) that points to a general location.",
    "There may also be cases requiring a comprehensive systematic sampling strategy where the presence or absence of the agent or material may be of investigative value. Finally, there may be little evi- dence to indicate where the release, if any, may have occurred.",
    "Under the first two scenarios, one would want to perform targeted sampling near release points and on surfaces near the release points where it is most probable that the biological agent may have been deposited. Only in the last scenario might some probabilistic sampling be prudent. Nevertheless, the ini- tial sampling may still begin, for example, with the ventilation system filters to determine if there was a release. Development of a knowledge and information database would facilitate the formulation of sampling strategies for different situations.",
    "RECOMMENDATIONS One of the goals of the DHS-sponsored Banbury meetings is to identify the most pressing needs in microbial forensics so that law enforcement, the NBFAC, and other scientific com- munity assets can focus their efforts on closing identified ca- pability gaps. For enhancing the tools available for sample collection, handling, transport, and storage and for obtaining maximal effectiveness in the application of investigative meth- ods, the following recommendations are offered. (i) Existing collection, storage, and transport protocols should be housed and curated at a single site.",
    "Such a database would allow a preliminary comparison of methods to deter- mine which methods are sufficiently validated, what further validation may be necessary, which methods are likely to suc- ceed, and which methods are not effective. This would reduce duplication of effort and allow scientists to build on previous knowledge to improve processing and analytical methodolo- gies. Moreover, an available knowledge database would facil- itate development of the best operational plans.",
    "All current methods, including those used by all federal agencies and those described in the literature, should be placed into the database, which should be accessible to appropriate entities. In addition to the protocols, the data should include information on the sample collection device, the type of agent (e.g., enveloped virus, RNA virus, toxin, bacterium) or other forensically re- lated material, what downstream analytical methods have been used on the collected or recovered material (e.g., extraction methods, live agent culture, PCR-based assay, elemental anal- ysis), the storage conditions (e.g., room temperature, 4degC, fro- zen at (cid:2)20degC, (cid:2)70degC), the transport conditions and media, the interpretation guidelines, the long-term storage conditions, and supporting validation data. (ii) Protocols need to be validated with a broad spectrum of bacterial species or strains, viruses, and toxins.",
    "There are many protocols that have not been rigorously validated, and this lack of evaluation limits the capabilities of crime scene investigators to make the most effective decisions when they develop oper- ational plans. In addition, subsequent interpretation of analyt- ical results could be compromised without validation data. Discipline-wide validation criteria should be developed.",
    "While it is not possible to prescribe every possible tool or method used to survey, capture, swab, assay, or otherwise detect patho- gens that may be found at a crime scene, some general criteria are needed to guide researchers and developers. These criteria should include sensitivity, specificity, recovery efficiency, main- tenance of integrity, impact on analytical assays, and baseline disease and pathogen data.",
    "(iii) Guidelines for collection of evidence at bioterrorism and biocrime scenes should be established. The best approach for searching a crime scene is the use of targeted strategies grounded with established guidelines and experience. Certain law enforcement personnel are trained specifically in the pro- cesses of crime scene investigation.",
    "The guidelines used for collecting and handling traditional forensic evidence should form the baseline for microbial forensic investigations. Indeed, the protocols developed by the Hazardous Material Response Unit at the FBI are based on such practices. Therefore, the crime scene investigation protocols of the FBI's Hazardous Material Response Unit should become the initial de facto national guidelines.",
    "The principles and guidelines should be made available to other appropriate organizations, so that they can benefit from previous experience; also, this could facilitate comparisons of information collected by different agencies. In addition, availability fosters peer review and leads to rigorous evaluation and thus could improve the current guidelines.",
    "The ultimate success of recovering evidence during a crime scene investigation is dependent on an understanding of the type(s) of organisms (fungi, bacteria, viruses, or other parasites) or other organic and nonorganic materials that might be present. Knowledge of the most effective tools for collection and recov- ery and of the best storage conditions is essential for improving the formulation of an operational plan, facilitating identifica- tion of the types of effective signatures, and minimizing the impact of potential inhibitors.",
    "Empirical data on validation studies should also exemplify scenarios to illustrate why and how collection tools and methods have to differ depending on the downstream methods used for detection and pathogen identification. Knowledge of what public health workers have already developed with respect to outbreak investigations would also be helpful for investigations, particularly those in- volving food.",
    "(iv) Finally, there is a need for training (12). Hazardous material response crime scene investigators responding to known crime scenes are likely trained in proper practices.",
    "However, there will be cases where law enforcement or med- ical examiners may be responding to a more traditional crime and unknowingly enter a scene where a biological agent has been involved or is being prepared. These investigators may not be aware that the scene is hazardous or that there are VOL. 72, 2006 MINIREVIEW 6437 signatures indicative of bioweapon preparation or production. Necessary training should be made available so investigators are more cognizant of the indications of the presence of suspected microbial biohazards (e.g., sophisticated equipment, egg incuba- tors, yogurt makers, beer-brewing equipment, bleach, pressure cooker, petri dishes, flasks, pH paper, improvised fermenters, mills, PPEs, sprayers).",
    "First responders at a crime scene are likely to be local per- sonnel or public health personnel and not necessarily individ- uals affiliated directly with law enforcement. In most cases, their top priorities are the health of victims, limiting disease spread and damage, and public security rather than preserva- tion of a potential crime scene and evidence collection. Making these first responders cognizant, or better yet appropriately training them, would be beneficial to maintaining operator safety and preserving evidence that may otherwise be lost.",
    "CONCLUSION The purpose of the October 2005 DHS Banbury meeting was to identify gaps and make recommendations regarding sample collection, handling, and preservation of microbial fo- rensic evidence. We report the nature of these discussions to inform the greater scientific community of ongoing directions in the field of microbial forensics. The microbial forensic in- vestigation, its success, and its impact are dependent upon the initial phases of a crime scene investigation, which rely heavily on the collection, handling, and preservation of physical evi- dence.",
    "If these procedures are not developed as well as possi- ble, the entire process is weakened. We stress that efforts should be intensified in the areas described here to ensure capability for robust development, validation, use, and reliabil- ity of microbial forensics to support the attribution of crimes involving the use of biological weapons. Additional or alter- nate viewpoints intended to bolster these research and devel- opment plans and, most importantly, to contribute to the clos- ing of gaps that can enhance capabilities of achieving attribution in acts of bioterrorism or crimes are welcome.",

    "The process of development of a modern information society requires changes in scientific views and established doctrinal provisions in different areas of law. Public relations in the digital environment cannot be fully regulated.",
    "This requires a new comprehensive scientific exploration, analysis of new ideas and the development of legal concepts. In our opinion, the specificity of the manifestation of personal non-property rights in the digital environment, in particular the rights to personal security, deserves special attention.",
    "The right to personal security in the science of civil law is regarded as a kind of personal non-property right of an individual having the highest social value. The right to personal security is closely linked to fundamental human rights to liberty and security of person. The current legislation of Ukraine, in particular the Civil Code, contains separate provisions on the regulation and protection of the individual's right to personal safety.",
    "The personal safety of an individual is, by its legal nature, a non-material benefit. Among the features of such a non- proprietary right, one should note the higher social value.",
    "The right to personal security is a variant of general human security and is aimed at protecting the private interest of an individual. The right to personal security is a state of protection of a particular individual from danger and is the antithesis of such legal category as risk 1 Given the significant number of threats to the rights of the individual in today's information society, it is necessary to intensify scientific research in a particular field.",
    "1. The right to information security in the system of personal non-property rights of an individual The analysis of the concept of personal security as a legal category should start with a general concept of security. Security is characterized as a state of protection of a person from external and internal threats.",
    "Thus, in particular, V.P. Vaskovskaya believes that the concept of \"human security\" in a generalized form means a degree of protection of a person, which ensures its sustainable development and is based on the activities of society, 1 Stefanchuk R. Suchasni tendentsiyi ta perspektivi rozvitku prava fizichnoyi osobi na osobistu bezpeku. Visnik Natsional'noyi akademiyi prokuraturi Ukrayini.",
    "No. 4. 2008 r. S. 53-58. guaranteed by the state, its bodies and officials to identify, prevent and eliminate the consequences of threats to human interests. On the other hand, in the narrow sense, human security is a stable state of reliable protection of vital (human life and health), legitimate and private human interests. Protection of her rights, freedoms and ideals, values against unlawful encroachments, threats and any harmful effects (physical, spiritual, property, informational, social, economic, political, environmental, military, etc.)2.",
    "O.A. Kolotkina notes that the concept of a person's right to security has a dual legal nature. On the one hand, it is a subjective right that characterizes the element of content of the general regulatory legal relationships that arise in connection with and about the security of each individual as a subject of law.",
    "From this perspective, the right of the individual to security as a legal category is natural and has its own meaning. On the other hand, the right of the individual to security is organically linked to such universally recognized fundamental rights and freedoms as the right to life, the right to liberty and security of person, other absolute and relative rights and freedoms.",
    "The right to security is in fact \"embedded\" in each of these rights. At the same time, the main focus is on the possibility of the realization of one's own rights and freedoms.",
    "Thus, there is every reason to argue that the right of the person to security is one of the basic elements of the whole modern system of human rights and freedoms, and therefore the legal system as a whole3. The purpose of the right to the personal safety of the individual must first and foremost guarantee the safety of the most fundamental, primary and non-renewable rights - the right to life and health4.",
    "Security is a system-forming category and may have a structural division depending on the area of interest it serves. By this criterion, we can distinguish such types of security as: national, political, economic, informational, legal, demographic, military, technical, environmental, nuclear, radiation, fire, sanitary-epidemiological, food, etc.",
    "Although the literature holds that all these varieties of security are included in the general concept of \"personal security\". However, according to R. Stefanchuk, this is a false statement and does not correspond to the content of the concept of security, where \"personal security\" is only one of its varieties5.",

    "It should be noted that the personal safety of an individual is, by its legal nature, a personal non-material benefit, endowed with such characteristic features. First, it is of higher social value as a kind of general human security (Article 3 of the Constitution of Ukraine) and closest in nature to personal inalienable rights (the right to life, dignity, personal integrity). Without the right to security, it is impossible to think about the reality of the exercise of these rights.",
    "Secondly, it arises simultaneously with the appearance of personality; has an individual focus on a specific entity - an individual, and is aimed at protecting his or her private interest. This is the differentiated benefit from, for example, national security, where the subject is not a particular individual, but a collective entity - a nation. However, closely linked to these categories, with the security of the state and society, the collective rights of social communities are exercised.",
    "Third, it is a state of protection of a particular individual from danger 6. Therefore, personal safety goes beyond personal physical security. This right is filled with the need to ensure the safety of the ecological, moral environment, social conditions of the person's realization of his biosocial nature7.",
    "In particular, in our opinion, it is worth talking about the right to information security of the individual, whose provision of modern conditions of development of information technologies and access to the Internet is relevant. Today, a large number of scholars from different branch of law are investigating the problems of information security of the individual.",
    "It is possible to distinguish O. Zolotar's thorough research \"Information security of the person: theory and practice\" which among other things defines the right to a secure information environment is not only protection of information, but also protection from negative information influences8. The main features of information security are: 1) The existence of certain stable conditions in which society resides; 2) Protection of vital interests of being human, society, state; 3) Aiming to prevent harm to these interests; 4) Acknowledgment of existence of differences of interests of the person, society, the state; 5) Recognition of the mutual connection of the person, society, the state in the prevention of their harm; 6 Vaganov P.A.

For example, it is a threat to the impact of low-quality information (untrue, false, misinformation) on the individual and society10. The realization of these threats leads to the violation of the most important absolute human rights and freedoms - for life, for health, for bodily integrity, respect for human dignity, for privacy, and so on11. 2.

To date, there are three main ways to access medical information on the Internet: 1) search for medical information; 2) interaction with medical professionals; 3) participation in support groups (Cline and Haynes, 2001). As you can see, there are several aspects to the problem of finding medical information on the Internet.",

    "Improper self-diagnosis, self- selection of methods and treatments based on information posted on online sources can directly harm the health and even the life of a person. The interactive nature of social media exacerbates these problems because anyone can download content to the site. In so doing, authors of medical information found on social media sites are often unknown or identified by limited information12.",
    "information on At present, it is impossible to assess the magnitude of the problem of poor quality medical information, as studies on this issue are not consistent. Although some authors believe that the quality of medical information on the Internet is poor (Doupi and Van der Lei, 1999; Latthe et al., 2000), others believe that it is of equal importance to information provided by other media (Sandvik, 1999 Hellawell et al. 2000). These controversial results are not surprising given the large number and variety of medical information sources on the Internet. Because of this problem, criteria for assessing the quality of the Internet have been developed by several health organizations (Eysenbach et al., 2000; Winker et al., 2000).",
    "These criteria take into account not only the content of the website (quality, reliability, accuracy, scale, etc.), but also the form (design, aesthetics, interactivity, use of the media, etc.), accessibility (fee for access, navigation, functionality, etc.), source reliability and privacy policies (Kim et al., 1999; Winker et al., 2000). So far, however, the impact of these criteria on the development and use of health information websites has been relatively weak, as they are subject to the good will of website designers and because users are unaware of them.",
    "Some research shows that using one of the most popular search engines (Google, AltaVista, Lycos, etc.) to search for information about a particular disease, only one in five links to a website with relevant information. Important information about each of the selected health issues is not available on most of the websites studied.",
    "This deficiency can adversely affect users' decisions. For example, lack of information about alternative treatments prevents users from making informed choices (Berland et al., 2001). In addition, although the information available is often valid, in many cases it is incomplete.",
    "Moreover, finding accurate health information can also be difficult, due to lack of usability and persistence (sites disappear and change without notice) (Cline and Haynes, 2001). Once the information has been found and assumed to be reliable and complete, users should understand it and bring it to life (D'Alessandro et al., 2001).",

Ventola Social Media and Health Care Professionals: Benefits, Risks, and Best Practices URL: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4103576/ (data zvernennia: 06.01.2020). websites provide technical information for people who are unfamiliar with the scientific medical literature13. Another problem with medical information posted on the Internet and the potential harm to the health of Internet users is the activity of pharmaceutical companies that can promote their products directly to consumers.",
    "Products can be advertised directly on company websites, in partnership with health information websites, or through banner ads on other websites. These new ways of disseminating medical information carry important risks of conflict of interest and drug overdose (Meyers, 2001). It is difficult for Internet users to distinguish between materials that promote drugs, as well as non-public information about health problems and their treatment.",
    "In addition, knowledge of different therapeutic alternatives allows patients to be more informed and make informed choices, but it may also make them insist on prescribing unnecessary or ineffective medicines. Finally, it is now possible to make more or less legal purchases online (such as Viagra), which can endanger human health through excessive consumption, dangerous products, drug interactions, etc. (deKieffer, 2000). Therefore, the danger is that the Internet can increase the use of health services and drugs without having a positive impact on the quality of care, disease prevention or health promotion14.",
    "Another way to access health information on the Internet is to interact with health professionals. Such information may be useful to the Internet user in certain circumstances. The dissemination of medical information on the Internet can facilitate the transfer of knowledge from healthcare professionals to the public and help people maintain and improve their health. tools available There are many social media for healthcare professionals, including social media platforms, blogs, media sharing sites, and more.",
    "These tools can be used to improve or enhance professionalism, education, organizational assistance, patient care, patient education, and health care programs. However, they also present potential risks such as the dissemination of poor quality information, damage to professional image, breach of patient confidentiality, breach of personal and professional boundaries, and other ethical or legal issues. Today, there are some ways to solve certain problems.",
    "This could be the implementation of a mechanism for directing Internet users to peer- reviewed sites with verified and reliable information. Yes, Tak, HCPs can guide patients to credible peer-reviewed websites where the information is subject to quality control.",

    "We should note that this study focuses primarily on prosuicide search terms and thus likely excludes many suicide prevention and support resource sites. Recupero et al.11 also conducted a study that examined suicide-related sites that could be found using Internet search engines. Of the 373 Web site hits, 31% were suicide neutral, 29% were anti-suicide, and 11% were prosuicide.",
    "The remaining sites either did not load or included \"suicides\" in the title but were not suicidal sites (e.g. movie sites and novels with \"suicides\" in their title or music bands whose names included \"suicides\"). Together, these studies have shown that obtaining prosuicide information on the Internet, including detailed information on suicide methods, is very easy16.",
    "As you can see, there are several factors behind the rise in Internet-induced suicides. These can be Cyberbullying and cyber harassment.",

    "1. Fights, or flaming - the exchange of short inflammatory cues between two or more people, which is usually deployed in public places on the Web; 2. Harassment attacks are repeated offensive messages directed at the victim (for example, hundreds of sms on a mobile phone, constant calls), with overload of personal communication channels. They also occur in chats and forums and online games; 3. Denigration - the dissemination of degrading false information. Text messages, photos, songs that are often sexual in nature; 4.",
    "Impersonation, impersonation - the persecutor positions himself as a victim by using his password to access an account on social networks, blogs, mail, instant messaging, or creates his account with a similar nickname and performs on behalf of the victim negative communication.

Fraud, confidential information hijacking and outing & trickery - receiving personal information and posting it on the Internet or sending it to unauthorized persons; 6. Isolation.",
    "Any person has a desire to be a member of a group. Exclusion from the group is perceived as social death. The more a person is excluded from interaction, the worse he / she feels and the more his / her self-esteem falls.",
    "In a virtual environment, this can lead to complete emotional destruction of the child. Online alienation is possible in any type of environment where password protection is used, a spam list or friends list is formed. Cyber isolation is also manifested by the lack of response to instant messages or emails; 7. Cyber-harassment - the hidden tracking of a victim for the purpose of organizing an attack, beating, rape, etc.; 8. Hapisling (slap slap) - the name comes from cases in the London subway where bullies beat random passersby for laughing and raising their own status by recording it on a cellphone camera.",

    "Suicide videos, suicide descriptions, and suicide practices can all be posted on the Internet in the public domain. A recent study by Dunlop et al.specifically examined possible contagion effects on suicidal behavior via the Internet and social media. Of 719 individuals aged 14 to 24 years, 79% reported being exposed to suicide-related content through family, friends, and traditional news media such as newspapers, and 59% found such content through Internet sources 18.",
    "Therefore, it can be noted that accessibility and speed of information dissemination on the Internet, lack of control over such information is a negative factor. This can encourage vulnerable people to commit suicide.",
    "Foreign experience can be used to solve the problem, including we also found examples of features on Web and social media sites that allowed for proactive prevention capabilities. For example, Google's Internet search engine has a feature that displays a link and a message about the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at the top of the search page when keyword searches suggest suicidal ideation or intent (eg, \"I want to die\")19.",

The problem is balancing the right to freedom of information and the right to life and health One of the most difficult problems is securing the right to receive \"secure\" information from the Internet that does not endanger the life, physical and mental health of the individual.

In parallel, we used the Dreyfus scale as an example when we developed the Developmental stages of competency development (Figure 3) to classify descriptors [35, 36]. We asked experts to identify descriptors for the ten core competencies of transformational leadership and assign them to the stage Competent leader (Stage 1), Proficient leader (Stage 2), leader (Stage 4).",
    "Expert leader (Stage 3), and Transformational Experts in the operationalization workshop agreed that they could not assign descriptors to the stages model because stages are not distinct. Instead, they agreed it would be best to take a cumulative approach to assessing degrees of transformational leadership by using the number of transformative behaviors an individual exhibits to quantify their level of competency attainment.",
    "We thus drafted a self-assessment tool to estimate the level of competency reached: Users rate themselves on a scale for each descriptor and are scored by cumulative points. We will validate this tool in a follow-up project once we define the numerical ranges that will help us determine how to assign the user to the appropriate stage (Figure 3).",

This unique descriptors integrates context as a key factor in developing a fluid, integrated concept of transformational leadership competencies.",
    "contexts. Some Strengths and Limitations of the Study While experts came from 30 countries, engagement must be regarded as partial and incomplete, especially as there was an overrepresentation of African experts. This limitation might restrict the applicability and robustness of the competencies due to the absence of perspectives from broader and more experts who attended the first diverse workshop did not return for the second. It is possible our results are skewed towards the views of those experts who were most interested in the study.",
    "Real-world testing of the competency framework will show whether the competenciesare and context-sensitive. Future researchers could seek mandatory consent to participate in all rounds of Delphi in advance to avoid this problem.",
    "Our study was strengthened by the mix of synchronous and asynchronous phases: the asynchronous phases offered experts a high degree of anonymity, while the synchronous phases allowed experts to discuss and take positions within the group. indeed context-specificthe they practices We singled out the work of Kouzes and Posner [15] and the the thematic WHO-ASPHER Framework [11] because of their descriptors and their classification into relevance of levels.",
    "The five overarching practices (Leadership Practices Inventory) Kouzes and Posner describe were key to the development of our competency framework, and particularly our descriptions of practices [15]. However, the Leadership Practices Inventory [15] does not include transparent, open- access representations of their methodological approach to their developing accompanying behaviors.",
    "Our study aligns with the WHO- ASPHER Competency Framework [11], the DrPH Core Competency model [8, 13], the Leadership Practices Inventory",
    "[15] and the Core Competencies for Public Health Professionals [16] in their approach to define behavioral descriptions for competencies. The WHO-ASPHER framework provides level descriptors for each levels (competent, proficient, expert), but we decided to take a cumulative approach to guide our assessment of the degree to which competencies are achieved and mastered. Our experts agreed, after the second Delphi workshop (Delphi Round 5), that the stages would overlap too much to be clearly divided into \"Competent leader,\" \"Proficient leader,\" \"Expert leader\" and \"Transformational leader\" (see Figure 3).",
    "describedandof context on the expression of Most competency frameworks assume the sequence of competencies is static and usually do not acknowledge the influence individual competencies. In contrast, our study did not assume that a fixed list of competencies would be universally relevant and globally applicable, so we integrated context, using it as a starting point to determine the relevance of competencies and to direct the acquisition/development of competencies.",

Our framework is complementary to existing competency frameworks in public health that address core surveillance and monitoring public health tasks because we claim that leadership is not confined to a single domain within a defined category (see the category \"Relations and Interactions\" in the WHO-ASPHER Framework) rather a dimension that cross-cuts (see Regional Core Competency Framework for domains (RCCFPH) Public Health this leadership may lead to more unisonous transformational execution of core public health tasks.",

Drawing transformational [11] but such ason Significance of the Study: Possible Mechanisms and Practical Implications Transformational leadership competencies matter in the specific situations where they are applied. This makes them globally valuable and relevant across different work cultures.",
    "We anticipate that our framework will be of interest to educators who are responsible for curriculum design, and especially those who want to align curricula with local goals and contextualize leadership education. In practice, the framework and its accompanying descriptors should guide the selection and alignment of curricular elements such as learning objectives, methods, activities and assessments. Specifically, this involves examining curricula to assess whether they teach the skills necessary for students to develop certain competencies. This comparison includes evaluating the content and methods used in educational programs (such as textbooks or lesson plans) against a list of skills (descriptors) required for a specific task or job (Supplementary File-Self-assessment Tool: Competenciesfor Transformational Leadership). Context sensitivity and specificity is of overriding relevance, especially in countries where educators seek to stem the out- migration of graduates in the health professions",

    "Researchers should seek to define value ranges for the individual stages of each competency and refine its descriptors, they should also determine single competencies in various contexts. Then the next group of researchers can determine which curricular elements (e.g., experiential learning, access to networks and partnerships, mentorship, replacement programs) most successfully support students in obtaining the necessary tools, competencies, and know-how to meetas challenges transformational leaders",

Public health educators can use our context-specific and context- sensitive framework to determine the degree to which transformational leadership competencies are achieved and mastered, optimize teaching curricula, strengthen links between educational and workforce sectors, tailor curricula to specific contexts, and potentially stem the tide of emigrating graduates. The competency framework could be applied to leadership development in domains extending beyond public health. Professionals can use it to benchmark workforce performance and systematically reveal competency gaps the educational sector can then address.",

    "This Introduction In general, reimbursement for laboratory services in this country comes from two third-party payer sources - government and private third-party payment allows patients to access laboratory services from hospitals, physician offices, long-term care and other post acute providers and private laboratories. There are many components this complex reimbursement system, including how and when tests are covered (coverage decisions), procedure and diagnosis codes (identifying what was actually ordered and performed) and payment methodologies. While levels of reimbursement are intended to reflect the value and the cost of the service being provided, over time the level of payment has been continually reduced to meet financial goals of the government or the healthcare system.",
    "to level. The Medicare program Government payers primarily reflect Medicare on the federal level and Medicaid (Medical Assistance) on the state is the most influential reimbursement system since it often impacts state programs and private payer reimbursement policies and payment levels.",
    "All public payers and approximately 67% of private payers use Medicare's payment methodologies as the basis for their own and as tools for negotiating discounts with providers.1 In our current fiscal environment, with pressures on the federal budget and concerns about the long term viability of Medicare, we have seen a change in which the Medicare program is beginning to look at private payer reimbursement financial levels as an opportunity to reduce responsibility for laboratory reimbursement. its The steady reduction in payment levels from Medicare and other payers are resulting in a negative impact on laboratory practice and access. Unfortunately, Congress, rather than calling for the restructure of the federal payment system, continually views the laboratory as a VOL 27, NO 2 SPRING 2014 CLINICAL LABORATORY SCIENCE FOCUS: HEALTHCARE REFORM AND LABORATORY REIMBURSEMENT source of potential revenue and repeatedly reduces payment to meet federal financial needs.",
    "The same can be said for the Medicaid program and private third party payers. There continues to be ongoing discussion of how laboratory reimbursement, when regarded as a commodity, can continue to be reduced or restructured. Concepts, including co-insurance or copayments and competitive bidding remain on the radar as a way to the reduce responsibility for the reimbursement of laboratory services.",
    "federal government's share of the reform, under the 2010 Although healthcare Accountable Care and Patient Protection Act, is intended to make much-needed change in this area, the Medicare statute has historically restricted payment for screening and other preventive technologies and services, unless otherwise specified by Congress. are Currently Medicare reimbursement varies across 56 different fee schedules based on geography. This adds unnecessary bureaucracy, waste and complexity to the significant system.",

Due to the lack of comparable and reliable cost data for laboratory testing, between there reimbursement levels and cost. We know that the cost of production varies significantly based on volume and economies of scale, as well as technology and the type of testing performed - acute care hospital, physician office, large automated reference laboratories, etc. relationship unknown an is Another deficiency in the current payment models is a lack of transparency in terms of how payment levels are initially established and updated.",
    "The current Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) concepts of cross-walk and gap-filling are inconsistently utilized and do not reflect the appropriate analysis of the true cost to perform testing. 2,3 implementing comprehensive and reliable information systems, developing quality systems and implementing state of the art technology will require adequate financial resources and reimbursement methodologies need to reflect this continual change dynamic of the industry. Demonstration of the value of laboratory testing will be imperative if reimbursement systems are to effectively reflect that value.",
    "This article will describe the mechanisms by which the Medicare program, and thus most other payment programs, have reimbursed laboratory services in this country over time. It will also address the current status of laboratory service reimbursement and the potential threats for the near term future. Once Upon a Time - The Way it Used to Be The Medicare program was voted into law in 1965 and eligible beneficiaries were able to enroll in the program in July of 1966.",
    "In the beginning, reimbursement for all Medicare services was based on what is called cost-based fee-for-service payment, which was determined retrospectively, after the service was provided. If a beneficiary received a service, either inpatient or the provider organization - hospital, outpatient, physician office, private laboratory - billed their customary charge to Medicare and was generally reimbursed at that rate or at an appropriate cost-based level.",
    "Under this system, Medicare made interim payments to hospitals throughout the hospital's fiscal year. At the end of the fiscal year, the hospital filed a cost report and the interim payments were reconciled with \"allowable costs\" which were defined in regulation and policy. Under this payment system, Medicare's hospital costs increased dramatically; between 1967 and 1983, costs rose from $3 billion to $37 billion annually.4",
    "This basic concept stayed in place until the early 1980s when both inpatient and outpatient reimbursement structures changed dramatically. It is at this point that the mechanisms for payment diverged for services provided during a hospital stay (inpatient) and those provided in an outpatient or clinic setting.",
    "If the quality, safety and outcomes for patient care are going to be improved and even transformed, one of the primary enablers will be clinical laboratory testing. Maintaining an adequate and dependable workforce, In order to control the rapidly escalating costs of providing Medicare in 1982 Congress services, mandated the creation of a prospective payment system (PPS) to control costs.",
    "This had been tried in many VOL 27, NO 2 SPRING 2014 CLINICAL LABORATORY SCIENCE lDownoadedfromhttp://hwmant.csournal.ascs.org/oniljlJanuary FOCUS: HEALTHCARE REFORM AND LABORATORY REIMBURSEMENT is system successfully.",
    "This a per-case states reimbursement mechanism under which inpatient admission cases are divided into relatively homogeneous categories called diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). In this DRG prospective payment system, Medicare pays hospitals a flat rate per case for inpatient hospital care so that efficient hospitals are rewarded and inefficient hospitals are penalized and have an incentive to become more efficient.",
    "In the beginning there were 499 DRG classifications, which increased to 538 over time. In 2007 the structure was altered with the classifications being called Medical Severity DRGs (MS-DRGs) and there are now 745 MS-DRG classifications which allow for severity adjustment, rather than assuming that all patients in a specific DRG category (i.e. congestive heart failure) are the same. For example, DRG 127 was no longer the DRG for principal diagnosis congestive heart failure (CHF). In place of DRG 127 are three new MS-DRGs 291, 292, and 293, depending upon the secondary diagnoses reported along with the principal diagnosis of CHF, thus reflecting a degree of severity of illness.",
    "This system recognizes that there may be major secondary complications and comorbidities or a diagnosis, all of which will impact the amount of services required for treatment.4 The principle behind the MS-DRG structure is called case mix complexity and refers to an interrelated set of patient attributes that contribute to the cost of care. Those distinct attributes include severity of illness, risk of mortality, prognosis, treatment difficulty, need for intervention and resource intensity.",
    "The payment adjustments to the DRG fall into four categories.4 Since labor is the largest cost component in healthcare, the labor component of the MS-DRG payment can be adjusted based on the wage index for the location of the hospital. There can be a disproportionate share add-on payment if the hospital treats a high percentage of low income patients.",
    "For teaching hospitals, an add-on payment can be made which is called an indirect medical education (IME) adjustment based on the ratio of residents to beds or residents to average daily census. Finally there are outlier payments for specific, costly patients.",
    "Under the DRG, and now MS-DRG system for incentives changed inpatient reimbursement, the dramatically in hospitals. It was now important to understand the overall payment that the hospital would have received for a specific patient and be able to provide the necessary care at a cost below that fixed payment. It was during and following the transition to DRGs and MS-DRGs that we saw the increased focus on reducing length-of-stay, the beginning of a focus on process improvement (Lean and 6 Sigma) and the first stages of beginning to view the laboratory and other ancillary and diagnostic departments as cost centers rather than revenue centers.",
    "In terms of prospective reimbursement, other payers - governmental and private, have shifted to this method of payment for inpatient reimbursement. Not all of them are similar to DRGs and prospective payment can take many forms, but in all cases the basic principle of paying for inpatient care in a bundled or packaged form is at the core of the payment structure. In addition to a specific payment system based on diagnosis (i.e. MS- DRG) this can take the form of a per-day or per stay type of payment.",
    "There is still a small, continually decreasing, percentage of patients that are paid for based on fee-for service. This is due to a few private payers that still have this payment structure and also for those patients who are self-pay. In the latter, hospitals often have programs to reduce the charges or to develop a reasonable payment plan for the patient. Outpatient reimbursement One of the major changes in healthcare, which resulted from the move to prospective payment systems for inpatients, was a significant, steady transition to treating as much as possible in an outpatient or ambulatory setting.",
    "Similar to inpatient laboratory reimbursement, the payment methodology under the Medicare program changed dramatically in the early 1980s, specifically in 1984 when the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (CLFS) was established. Medicare currently pays for outpatient clinical laboratory tests using a prospective payment system (PPS) established in 1984.",
    "Payments for over 1,100 tests are set separately in fee schedules for each of 56 geographic jurisdictions, limited by national fee caps called National Limitation Amounts (NLAs). Payments are based on what laboratories charged in 1983, updated periodically for inflation.",

    "Unlike most other services reimbursed by the Medicare program, there is no beneficiary cost sharing for the laboratory. This means there is no co-insurance or co-pay requiring the beneficiary to bear part of the responsibility for paying for laboratory services.2 is problematic As one can see, having these fees based on what for in 1983 laboratories charged laboratories, especially since the updates that were supposed to occur annually have not occurred 12 times since 1990 and in recent years have actually been reduced. The CLFS is intended to be adjusted based on the annual Consumer Price Index (CPI) which would reflect the ongoing increase in the cost of labor, services and supplies.",
    "However these increases were frozen or canceled based on the financial needs of the federal government and the Medicare program specifically.5 While less than 2% of all Medicare spending, clinical laboratory testing has been subject to significant freezes in payments and cuts over the last decade. In fact, a hypothetical test that was reimbursed at $10.00 in 1984 would be reimbursed at $8.32 today in nominal dollars and just $3.83 in real or 1984 dollars. Had this $10 test been updated for inflation as it was supposed to be under the 1984 law which established the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule that same test would be reimbursed at $21.72 today.",
    "Most outpatient laboratory testing is reimbursed under the CLFS - hospital outpatients, clinic patients and hospital-based and private reference laboratories. One exception is patients receiving services in a critical access hospital (CAH). These laboratories, in specific hospitals of 50 beds or less located in areas with population densities in the lowest quartile, are reimbursed on a reasonable cost basis, recognizing the reality of having a higher cost structure.",
    "lead, most Medicare's state Following Medicaid/Medical Assistance programs base their individual fee schedules on the Medicare CLFS. Many are lower than the CLSF and are a specific percentage below the Medicare fee schedule. For example, in Minnesota, the Medicaid fee schedule is 7% below the Medicare fee schedule. Therefore whenever Medicare freezes or lowers the CLFS, the states, which base their reimbursement on the CLFS, make similar adjustments.",
    "In the private payer world, some payers base their VOL 27, NO 2 SPRING 2014 CLINICAL LABORATORY SCIENCE payments on the Medicare fee schedule, and similar to state Medicaid programs may have general rules which base their fee schedule on specific percentage of the Medicare CLFS, and in extreme examples it can be at a level of 50% of the CLFS. Other private payers develop their own fee schedule methodology, pay based on a percentage of submitted charges, or bundle into the overall outpatient visit, a direction that Medicare moved to for hospital outpatients on January 1, 2014.5 Current threats to laboratory reimbursement We as laboratory services practitioners provide the laboratory data that serve as the foundation for the diagnosis and clinical management of conditions like heart disease, pediatric conditions including leukemia, cancer, diabetes, kidney disease, and infectious diseases as well as management of chronic health conditions. Cuts in reimbursement for laboratory services threaten our ability to meet the needs of physicians and patients, not only for seniors but for all Americans.",
    "With the level of cuts being sustained, laboratories cannot hire qualified individuals to perform and interpret these tests, integrate new science into medicine and keep the hundreds of hospital, community and regional laboratories across the United States that provide these services open. While less than two percent of all Medicare spending, clinical laboratory testing has been subject to significant freezes in payments and cuts over the last two decades. Medicare payment amounts for clinical laboratory services have been reduced by about 40 percent in real (inflation adjusted) terms over the past 20 years.",
    "in the rate of The cost of clinical laboratory services has increased significantly in the last 25 years, while the clinical laboratory fee schedule has been cut severely. Today, clinical laboratories are paid only 75 percent of the 1984 level when adjusted for inflation.",
    "This constitutes a real reduction in reimbursement and not just a reduction increase that has been experienced by other health care services. The shrinking Medicare clinical diagnostic laboratory reimbursement is not keeping pace with the changes in cost, technology, complexity and delivery of clinical laboratory services over the past two decades.",
    "In recent years, landscape has continually been a target for federal budget cuts and there are additional threats on the immediate horizon. reimbursement the current lDownoadedfromhttp://hwmant.csournal.ascs.org/oniljlJanuary FOCUS: HEALTHCARE REFORM AND LABORATORY REIMBURSEMENT Healthcare Reform - Patient Protection and Accountable Care Act Clinical laboratories suffered deep cuts as a result of healthcare reform. The law includes a direct and immediate cut to the Part B Clinical Lab Fee Schedule of 1.75 percent each year from 2011 through 2015.",
    "This nine percent cut is the largest cut among all Part B providers. Clinical laboratories also received another cut through the productivity adjustment--one of only a few providers that were subject to an immediate adjustment in 2011--resulting in a potential additional 11 percent cut over ten years.",
    "Together, the direct cut and the productivity adjustment result in a cumulative 20 percent cut over ten years. Specifically for 2014, there will be the combination of the ACA cut and the productivity adjustment of -0.75% for the year.",
    "Laboratories were also subject to a 2 percent cut to the fee schedule as a result of sequestration, which began in January, 2013. Those sequestration cuts were not reduced for Medicare programs in the recent budget agreement by Congress for 2014.",
    "Another change that occurred on January 1, 2013, as part of healthcare reform, was the imposition of the medical device tax. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act levies a 2.3% excise tax on the sale and import of Class I, II, and III medical devices.",
    "This part of the legislation includes instruments, machines, implants, and in vitro reagents. While the House of Representatives has voted to repeal this new tax, the Senate has not yet acted on the repeal, although a majority of the members of the Senate support it. Basically, labs that purchase these devices could be responsible for paying this tax because suppliers, manufactures, and distributors are likely to pass along these added expenses.",
    "In essence this becomes an additional time when laboratory expense at a reimbursement is continually under attack.6,7 Office of Inspector General (OIG) Report (2013): Comparing Lab Test Payment Rates: Medicare Could Achieve Substantial Savings In 2010 Medicare, as the largest payer of clinical laboratory services, paid approximately $8.2 billion for lab tests, which accounted for 3 percent of all Medicare Part B payments. The study compared Medicare reimbursement rates to other health care service payers to determine if Medicare was a prudent purchaser of laboratory services. The Office of Inspector General compared Medicare laboratory reimbursement under the CLFS to all 50 of the state Medicaid programs and to three Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) plans that pay for lab tests on a fee-for-service basis.",
    "OIG compared to reimbursement rates for 20 high volume laboratory tests for January 1-March 31, 2011. What they found was that in 2011, Medicare paid between 18 and 30 percent more than other insurers for 20 high-volume and/or high-expenditure lab tests. Based on this analysis the OIG concluded that Medicare could have saved $910 million, or 38 percent, on these lab tests if it had paid providers at the lowest established rate in each geographic area.",
    "While most state Medicaid programs and two of the three Federal Employee Health Benefit programs use the Medicare CLFS as a basis for establishing their own fee schedules and payment rates, most actually pay less. In addition, many of these programs also factor in competitor information from private payers in the setting of their fees. Furthermore, many of these programs also have co- insurance, co-payments and deductibles to reduce their share of payment.8 Based on this study, the OIG recommended to Congress that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) seek legislation that would allow it to establish lower payment rates for lab tests and consider seeking institute copayments and deductibles for lab tests.",
    "Although this has not yet been acted on, members of Congress are very aware of the study and CMS is investigating whether it has the authority to make such a change.8 legislation to Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) The Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) is a method currently used by the CMS to control spending by Medicare on physician services. It was enacted in 1997 as part of the Balanced Budget Act.",
    "The intent was to assure that the growth in physician payments did not exceed the capacity of the economy to support it. For many years, most people have agreed that the methodology is no longer valid and they continue to call in physician reimbursement.",
    "Because those changes would not be sustainable or palatable, Congress has passed a temporary fix each year. There now seems to be appetite in Congress for a permanent fix.",
    "Unfortunately there is a significant price tag to making the fix and the concern for dramatic annual decreases VOL 27, NO 2 SPRING 2014 CLINICAL LABORATORY SCIENCE lDownoadedfromhttp://hwmant.csournal.ascs.org/oniljlJanuary FOCUS: HEALTHCARE REFORM AND LABORATORY REIMBURSEMENT of the laboratory industry is that Congress may decide to further decrease laboratory reimbursement in order to pay for the fix.",
    "One suggestion would be to extend the temporary annual reduction of the fee schedule under healthcare reform to be extended beyond the intended 5 years.9 Competitive Bidding Competitive bidding is another form of reducing reimbursement. For Medicare it is currently in place for durable medical equipment.",
    "In this process, all laboratories in a defined geographical area would be required to bid on the Medicare laboratory business with pricing that would be offered for each CPT procedure code. Depending on the specific model, one or more winning bidders would be selected based on lowest pricing and ability to provide access to the patients in the area. \"Losing\" bidders may either be excluded for participating or would have to be willing to offer services at the pricing level of the winning bidder(s).",
    "Competitive bidding creates incentives for laboratories that may cause them to compromise quality in an effort to reduce costs and secure the bid. When cost becomes the major driving force in the system, quality suffers.",
    "True competition requires the continued viability of qualified providers of laboratory services in diverse settings. Under forced fiscal constraints, as a result of winning a contract, quality may not be maintained.",
    "Competitive bidding also restricts patient access to quality laboratory services by driving out small, convenient local laboratories. Decreased access will occur especially in rural and other underserved areas where the small laboratories do not have the operating margins or volumes to become effective competitive bidders.",
    "Co-insurance/Laboratory Copay Most patient care services provided to Medicare beneficiaries have a component of payment that involves patient responsibility. In these cases the patient pays a specific dollar amount or percentage for a procedure or episode of care and Medicare pays the rest. This reduces Medicare's share of financial responsibility. For laboratory services, Medicare does not require a copayment or coinsurance, a decision, which was made in 1984 when the laboratory fee schedule became reconsiders effective.",
    "Frequently Congress VOL 27, NO 2 SPRING 2014 CLINICAL LABORATORY SCIENCE responsibility aspect to implementing a patient laboratory reimbursement, as it would significantly reduce payments by the Medicare program. The problem this would cause for the laboratory is that the laboratory organization would need to collect the copayment directly from the patient.",
    "With each individual laboratory test usually being relatively low in price, the amount of effort and cost to collect the copayment would exceed the amount collected. For example, on a laboratory test with a reimbursement of $10, a 10% copayment would be $1.00 and the lab would lose money on each transaction and have difficulty collecting the payment.",
    "It would essentially lower laboratory reimbursement in the process. Hospital Outpatient Bundling of Laboratory Testing Effective January 1, 2014, another change from a final rule from CMS resulted in an additional impact on laboratory reimbursement. In this case, it applies specifically to hospital outpatient laboratory testing and is essentially bundling most outpatient laboratory services into the primary reason or procedure for the patient's outpatient visit.",
    "This was proposed under the Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS). Currently when an outpatient has clinical laboratory testing, those tests are reimbursed under the CLFS. In the new payment methodology, most tests will be bundled into the Ambulatory Patient Classification (APC), an outpatient version of the DRG.",
    "Exceptions that will continue to be separately reimbursed include molecular tests and tests unrelated to the primary reason for the visit. Depending on the patient and test mix, the impact for the hospital will vary.",
    "There will be a definite decrease in specific laboratory reimbursement, but that may be partially or completely offset by an increase in the APC reimbursement rate.10 Molecular Diagnostics Reimbursement (MoPath or MolDx)) Previously, molecular tests were reimbursed under a system where a number of stacking codes, which reflect the various components of the molecular testing process, were billed as a group and reimbursed as a sum. In 2013, a change was made where each analyte for molecular testing was assigned one unique code, which would be billed instead of multiple stacking codes.",
    "The MoPath or MolDX system was implemented by Palmetto, the Medicare carrier in California and has resulted in significantly decreased reimbursement rates lDownoadedfromhttp://hwmant.csournal.ascs.org/oniljlJanuary FOCUS: HEALTHCARE REFORM AND LABORATORY REIMBURSEMENT reimbursement.

This change dramatically impacts appropriate reimbursement for the fastest growing segment of clinical laboratory testing.11,12 13 Summary The continued cuts to laboratory reimbursement and threats of further reductions are completely out of sync with the percentage of total healthcare expenses in this country.",

Continued reimbursement cuts result in budget cuts that threaten the laboratories ability to provide high quality, safe laboratory services. This threatens access to quality patient care in rural and underserved areas.",
    "Clinical laboratories are the only segment of health care that have received real cuts and are reimbursed at rates lower than 1984 when adjusted for inflation. While others may have been frozen or had their increases moderated, no other segment gets paid less today than they did in 1984.",

    "According to the Institute of Medicine [3], the dietary supplements indus- try is one of the fastest growing industries, developing an annual average of 1,000 new products, and netting billions of dollars in annual revenue. Dietary supple- ments, including over-the-counter probiotic-containing food products such as yogurt, cereal, and wellness bars, are overwhelmingly marketed to a generally healthy population [4] under the umbrella of functional foods, or \"whole foods and fortified, enriched, or enhanced foods [that] have a potentially beneficial effect on health when consumed as part of a varied diet on a regular basis, at effective levels\" [[5] p.735].",
    "Marketing strategies promote \"vitality,\" these added health benefits \"balance,\" and \"beauty,\" and claim relief from digestive irregularity to acne. Recent research on public perceptions of these products suggests these strategies are lucrative, as products are becoming essential to peoples' preventative health care regimens [2], and consumers generally perceive these products as both safe and effective [6].",
    "in terms of The growth of this industry introduces several ethical, legal and social concerns about the commercialization of human microbiome research. Notably, how dietary supple- ments are mobilized within economic markets and gain so- cial currency for new public health uses, often without evidence to substantiate safety or effectiveness [7], and with sparing regulation or oversight. We contend that the rela- tionship between scientific research and commercialization manifests in terms of both a perceived public value and a marketable exchange value, or what sociologist Catherine Waldby [8] refers to as biovalue.",
    "To illustrate, we consider the commercial potential of large-scale human microbiome research efforts, particularly the Human Microbiome Pro- ject, that identify human microbial communities and good bacteria as having \"biological vitality\" [[8] p. 310]. The pub- lic value centers on expectations that these research efforts will provide a \"viable contribution to human health\"",
    "[[8] p. 310], while the marketable exchange value centers on expectations that industry will profit substantially from nat- ural or engineered biological commodities under the guise of contributing to human health. To date, there is a dearth of research as to how the commercialization of human microbiome research might further compound the ethical, legal, and social issues debated in the context of mainten- ance or restoration of good physical health and the preven- tion of disease or illness.",
    "Our purpose here is to begin to explore and discuss some of these issues, and their broader implications. The Human Microbiome Project The Human Microbiome Project (HMP), initiated in 2007 by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), aims to characterize the role human microbiota, or the collections of bacteria, viruses, and other microorgan- isms that inhabit human bodies, play in human health and disease. The HMP seeks to establish a relationship between microbial communities and human health, human behavior, and the environment, investigating whether or not individuals share a core human micro- biome, and whether or not changes in the human micro- biome are correlated with changes in human health [9].",
    "This large-scale, multi-site research effort was intended to yield not only clinical [10], pharmaceutical [11], and other public health [12] benefits, but also a reference set of microbial genome sequences, a repository to store including biological materials, and new technologies, tools for computational analysis, interpretation, and the Data Analysis and Coordinating Center (DACC) [13].",
    "Since its inception, researchers studying the human microbiome have associated the presence or absence of certain good bacteria with a number of chronic and acute conditions including atherosclerosis [14], inflammatory bowel disease [15], colon cancer [16], irritable bowel syn- drome [17], nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [18], and perinatal and neonatal health",
    "[19]. Additionally, bioinfor- maticists have developed specific tools and techniques to analyze, interpret, and store these data [20-22]. leaders Methods Drawing from a larger qualitative study exploring the eth- ical, legal, and social dimensions of human microbiome re- search, the findings presented here emerged from 60 semi- structured interviews we conducted with 63 scientists, (\"investigators\") researchers, and NIH project engaged in human microbiome research (2009-2010).",
    "Semi-structured interviews allowed us to set the agenda in terms of the topics we wanted to cover, while providing investigators flexibility in their discussions and interpreta- tions of these topics. These semi-structured interviews lasted between 30 and 90 minutes, and consisted of a series of open-ended questions exploring ethical, legal, and social challenges associated with human microbiome research. Topics discussed included investigator role; ethical chal- lenges; clinical applications and future ethical clinical impli- cations; precedents for managing ethical, legal, and social issues; ethical, legal, and social issues unique to microbiome research; and other topics as they arose see Additional file 1.",
    "In order to achieve a diverse sample of clinical, applied, and research expertise, we employed two sampling strat- egies. Initially, using a purposive sampling strategy [23], we identified 140 potential investigators from a publicly access- ible list of HMP Research Network Meeting Participants. Subsequent snowball sampling [23] supplemented our re- cruitment efforts, allowing us to interview investigators who, for example, were not directly involved in the HMP but were involved in human microbiome research.",

    "Of the 88 investigators who agreed to participate, 63 were interviewed in 60 distinct interviews (the remaining 25 were not interviewed due to scheduling conflicts). Investigators represented a range of academic disciplines, including genetics, pathology, microbiology, virology, gastroenterology, and medicine.",
    "transcriptionist All interviews were conducted in-person in the Baylor College of Medicine Center for Medical Ethics and Health Policy conference room, in investigators' offices, or during the January 2010 and August 2010 Human Microbiome Consortium meetings (Houston, Texas and St. Louis, Missouri, respectively). Interviews were digit- ally recorded and transcribed verbatim by an independ-ent service. We analyzed data (i.e. interview transcripts) using thematic content analysis. Two authors (MJS, LSA) independently coded tran- scripts and reached consensus in coding [24] using ATLAS.ti (v 6.2), a qualitative data analysis software pro- gram.",

A comprehensive explanation of our methods has been previously docu- mented [25].",
    "We limit our findings to the ethical, legal, and social considerations raised by human microbiome research that intersect with commercialization related issues, such as safety, risks and benefits, public awareness, and regulation. Below, we present each of these issues, paying particular attention to the ethical, legal, and social aspects of commercialization and human microbiome research. We conclude considering broader implications for public health and recommendations for policy change.",
    "Results and Discussion Commercialization, probiotics, and issues of safety Human microbiome research is expected to provide a valuable contribution to human health and disease pre- vention. One area of interest centers on investigating the utility of good bacteria, often delivered through pre- biotic, probiotic, or promicrobial therapies and treat- ments [26], for a range of acute and chronic diseases (i.e. diseases of the gastrointestinal tract). These and similar investigations bolster the scientific value of good bac- teria, opening a door for \"claims made by commercial organizations [that] cite the Human Microbiome Project and all of its findings as evidence that customers should buy their product.\"",
    "(Investigators #154) Investigators described the ways in which these claims have the po- tential to manifest in widespread commercialization of a range of over-the-counter probiotics, for example: I also see a huge push for probiotic anything. We always joke about probiotic lotion, probiotic chewing gum--I think they'll try to work probiotics into anything and everything they can.",
    "There's data out there that shows these communities are important. They're important in everything--from helping your immune system get started to breaking down the food that you eat, to just producing vitamins.",
    "So I really think that probiotics will be huge. There'll be many, many more, and it will be for the craziest things but-- like, you think of probiotic shampoo. I bet they can market probiotic shampoo to cure dandruff or something.",
    "It will be something crazy. Jergens will come out with probiotic lotion, and Extra chewing gum.",
    "(Investigator #135) Investigators recognized the currency of these com- mercial products, thus they were attuned to the ways in which scientific value is mobilized within markets to yield a public value, namely improving health through these products. There were those who the use of expressed concerns with this process, offering their insights into the myriad of problems associated with this burgeoning industry, specifically issues related to unsub- stantiated health claims and safety.",
    "One investigator described the safety issues associated with products that emphasize natural ingredients while minimizing syn- thetic or bioengineered ingredients: There's a bazillion packets for probiotics out there now. None of them have been validated. They all have organisms that are proprietary, you don't know what's in the box. .",
    ".that you're being fed industrially cultured organisms that at one point in their lives were probably related to something natural, but over the many, many zillions of generations they've been fermented. They're no longer a wild organism, they are an industrial organism. And we eat them and they may be replacing normal flora.",
    "We live in a highly processed environment and it seems that most studies are showing that experiencing a diverse collection of wild organisms is what we evolved from and what helped train our immune system. We--because we're more industrialized, we're probably experiencing less exposure to organisms. Organisms live in environments. Urban environments may be less rich in diversity and they may be less rich in the diversity we need.",
    "We sterilize all our vegetables, irradiate it, and we grow our animals in mass culture. We propagate huge outbreaks of Staph Aureus and Slashinski et al.",

    "(Investigator #133) described There werethe investigators who commercialization of dietary supplements, including pro- biotics, in terms of \"fad[s]\" (Investigator #119) or \"quack medicine\" (Investigator #104) not only because the claims made on behalf of these over-the-counter products are un- substantiated, but also because, like the products, the health claims are manufactured for the explicit purpose of turning a profit as opposed to actually improving the health of the consumer. One investigator described pla- cing the interests of the market over the interests of con- sumers, as \"I'll bet you this is a problem we only think about in Western capitalistic societies where we're worried about profit as opposed to community knowledge and community well-being.\"",
    "(Investigator #111) Scientific debates over the effectiveness and safety of dietary supplements seem to have had little influence on their popularity as health products. Even though there is a dearth of scientific evidence to support the health ben- efits conveyed by these products [27,28], the reputed health benefits might be the motivating factor that underscores the continued use of these products.",
    "The investigators with whom we spoke were aware of the growing popularity of these products, and while con- cerned, they were not surprised that \"people still keep using them.\" (Investigator #133) In one sense, continued use of these products may be a testament to the power of commercialization in a health oriented consumer cul- ture.",
    "Nettleton [29] refers to this culture as a new paradigm of health, which emphasizes individual re- sponsibility and lifestyle changes for ensuring good health and preventing disease. Marketing strategies adopt this rhetoric of individual responsibility, construct- ing the body in a state of imbalance, providing consu- mers with a choice to be healthy, and then encouraging them to be proactive. Within this new paradigm of health, marketing strategies do not need to include an explanation of why products are good for health, they only need to present products as simple or easy ways in which individuals can take responsibility for their health: \"[p]eople just get excited because they think it's going to magically solve their health problems",
    "[and] assume that something's going to deliver more than it says, than it really can.\" (Investigator #119) Public awareness of the benefits and risks of dietary supplements Investigators expressed strong opinions about the ways in which the dietary supplements industry exploits and manipulates scientific research to secure a profit, largely at the expense of the public: I think it's an industry that preys on people that will look for alternative forms of medicine - which I don't think are bad. . .I totally believe in holistic medicine. .",
    ".but there are some people who, because of the ability of advertising for those kinds of products, can be swayed to use and spend their money for things that are probably of no value. (Investigator #128) Commercial entities not only take advantage of scien- tific research, but also of an unaware public striving to achieve healthy bodies.",
    "Sharp and colleagues [7] reviewed several frameworks concerning public awareness regard- ing the benefits and risks of dietary supplements. They introduced several safety-related considerations, specific- ally in the use of probiotics, including the unpredictable behavior of both naturally occurring and genetically altered microorganisms, each of which have the potential to produce substances or gene-behaviors that are harm- ful to the body.",
    "Investigators contend, however, that the allure of good health trumps the risks, and results in these products being consumed more as an article of faith [27]: I think the biggest [issue] is just making sure that people are really aware of what they're doing.",
    "As an example, if probiotics do become the big thing, just making sure that people understand what they're taking and understand that it's not just some magical cure all, and that there are risks involved, also. . .[I]f",
    "people are thinking, 'Oh, probiotics are just a yogurt,' or something easy like that. . .you don't want them to get into that mindset that 'Oh this is something that's all good and there aren't any risks associated.' I don't know of any risks associated with eating Activia, but they just need to be aware that probiotics can do negative things, as well - can alter your microbiome in a bad way.",
    "(Investigator #156) Investigators were asked to share their thoughts about the most effective ways to increase the public's aware- ness about the risks and benefits of dietary supplements. Many focused on the need to use productive and under- standable language that serves to inform, rather than in- flame or scare, consumers: I think interfacing with the popular media is gonna be really key there.",
    "And that's so difficult, because there's a temptation to make - you know, put out speculative headlines based on the first announcement of some new disease association and Slashinski et al. BMC Medical Ethics 2012, 13:28 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6939/13/28 Page 5 of 8 those things can stick in the public's mind in a way that's not productive.",
    "(Investigator #145) However, investigators were aware that translating and disseminating this information has to be done in such a way that the general or lay public will understand.",
    "This was discussed in terms of the benefits and risks of in- cluding these products in a daily diet, for example the health implications of changing the balance between dif- ferent bacterial species, as well as understanding what this information means for them individually. Regulation In October 1994, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) was signed into law, amend- ing the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act",
    "[30]. DSHEA loosened restrictions on developers of dietary the \"representa- supplements by requiring only that tions or claims [are] substantiated by adequate evi- dence to show that they are not false or misleading.\" This means that dietary supplements are not subject to approval from the US Food and Drug Administra- tion (FDA) prior to marketing and distribution, nor are developers required to provide the FDA with evi- dence to substantiate safety or effectiveness before or after it markets its products. DSHEA places dietary supplements in a special category under the general umbrella of foods, not drugs, thus only requires that every supplement be labeled a dietary supplement.",
    "The lack of regulation was perceived as a political move purposed to bolster the economic potential of the diet- ary supplements industry: The probiotics industry is not accustomed to being regulated. There will be political agitation against it.",
    "It will probably be a bit like the vitamin supplements industry. . .maybe 10 or 15 years ago [the] FDA attempted to start regulating those, and there was furious backlash from the public. Congress passed a law, which actually prevented [the] FDA from regulating these supplements. . .The",
    "backlash was both from the public, because it turns out millions and millions of people take these things, and they don't want their access restricted, of course. It's big business, and of course big business doesn't want to be regulated, and so there was a backlash just on all fronts against that.",
    "(Investigator #113) Investigators perceived the politicization of these issues as harmful to the public's health: think you should have some guarantee that in fact there's cypress leaves in there, not arsenic. And just because it's sold by a health food store or it's a medical food or it's some other crap, you should have some assurance that it's not going to hurt you, and what's really in there is in there.",
    "And that should be across the board. (Investigator #108)",
    "An oversight committee, ideally one that does not have a vested economic interest and is charged primarily with protecting public health, should validate product asser- tions. Investigators recognized that disclosing product ingredients is important, and measures requiring full disclosure would prohibit the industry from misleading assertions.",
    "Overall, their concerns were less about use of these products, and more about how lack of regulation has the potential to negatively affect health. This could result in issues of where to draw the line: So, the science that I'm in, you can see sort of ethical implications of it when you walk through the drug store and you look at the homeopathic medicines and you see claims that are meant to look [like] scientific claims that are not supported by science. And, it turns out, that if it were a medicine, it would be regulated in one way--that you can't claim that the medicine helps unless it does, because it's medicine.",
    "But anything that's a food, you can make a different set of claims without the need for validation of these claims. The Human Microbiome Project ends up being a whole lot of science about bacteria growing in the gut as the body site that most closely ties to what we eat, and the connection between what we eat and health is potentially exploited by untold numbers of people in the sort of quack science of homeopathic medicine - the weak to nonexistent science of most probiotics - the claims that every breakfast cereal company wants to make.",
    "(Investigator #155) Taken together, investigators' insights into regulatory issues centered on the intersection of the public value and a marketable exchange value, and the implications of this to create more harm than good. Dietary supplements assert unsubstantiated health claims, and the current lack of regulation ensures the dietary supplements industry will continue to profit from these unsubstantiated claims. These issues are directly related to the public's health and wellbeing, and investigators not only recognized these issues but, overall, support stricter regulations that place the public's health over industry profits.",

    "place, Investigators' responses are less about the authority or expertise of biomedicine, and more about how biomed- ical research is co-opted by commercial entities that place profit over health. Investigators focused on the power of the industry, namely it is not about the pro- ducts themselves, but what the public is required to know about the products.",
    "For example, a product that claims \"all natural ingredients\" should be natural, not engineered in a lab. The themes we identified are intended to serve as points for discussions about the re- lationship between scientific research and the manufac- ture and distribution of over-the-counter dietary supplements. Spielmans and Parry [31] note that prior to understand- ing the utility of scientific data \"science has largely been taken captive in the name of increasing profits\" (p. 13).",
    "Investigators' responses suggest the commercialization of human microbiome research, for example the production and distribution of over-the-counter dietary supplements, is predicated on mass consumption, not health or well- being, in pursuit of potential profits. They suggest human microbiome research opens the door for what we will refer to as a commercialized intervention, or the proliferation of commercial products that claim maintenance or restor- ation of good health, and prevention of disease or sickness, with the use of good bacteria. Under the current paradigm of health that encourages individual responsibility, we need to consider why individuals begin or continue to use dietary supplements even when faced with evidence ques-",
    "tioning safety or effectiveness, as well as the ethical impli- cations of therapeutic misconception. Previous research suggests many patients use probiotics because they con- sider them to be natural or part of complementary and al- ternative medicine [6]. Additionally, marketing strategies allude to the empowering affects of dietary supplements, such as \"be proactive\" or \"nutrition possible,\" and these affects create hope of good health. This political economy of hope depends on simple and quick actions or behaviors to take responsibility for our health, and we feel empow- ered when we spend the money on dietary supplements that promise good health",
    "[32]. Investigators' primary legal concerns centered on regu- lation and policy change.",
    "Unsubstantiated claims about the effectiveness of these products have the potential to cause harm [33]. Substantive changes at the policy level constitute the most effective way to regulate the current dietary supplements industry, as well as protect the public's health. Regulations previously advanced under DSHEA",
    "[30], including preventing the dietary supple- ments industry from deceit or manipulation, being truthful about the actual health benefits of their pro- ducts, requiring manufacturers to list ingredients on each product, and how the product's dosage is or is not useful (i.e. does the product contain an adequate amount of probiotic to affect positive health?), might be insuffi- cient in the context of the current commercial market. Manufacturers are responsible for ensuring the safety of their products and consumers are responsible for report- ing adverse events; the FDA, however, is responsible only for investigating consumer claims that a product is unsafe. Given the increasing availability of over-the- counter dietary supplements, and the profit incentive to produce these supplements, future research should examine the utility of current regulations, specifically whether or not these regulations are in place to protect the public or the market.",
    "There are broader ethical, legal and social implications associated with commercialization and human micro- biome research, which should be considered in future research. Sharp and colleagues",
    "[7], for example, intro- duced the environmental impact of probiotics. They raised concerns about negative changes to the microbial ecosystem of the human host, focusing on the different ways in which people process these supplements and the potential for developing immunity to probiotic bacteria.",
    "They also discussed concerns about external environ- mental contamination, focusing on the release of genet- ically altered or engineered bacteria into the external environment. Future research should consider the long- term impact of internal and external environmental con- tamination, exploring the ways in which the commercial market has the potential to mitigate or exacerbate these concerns.",
    "Additionally, recent research highlights issues of ownership implicated in this research. Hawkins and O'Doherty",
    "[34] explore the symbiotic rela- tionship between microorganisms and the human body, particularly in the context of private or government bio- banks. While their analysis does not focus on issues of commercialization, future research should consider how this issue might play out in a commercial market.",
    "The commercialization of human microbiome research, for example, has the potential to give a marketable exchange value to an individual's microbiome or bacteria. Because the commercial market is focused on profit, there is po- tential for buying samples to access bacterial sequences for commercial research (e.g. pharmaceutical research). type of The purpose of this article was to fill a gap in the litera- ture concerning the commercialization of human micro- biome research.",

The purpose of this study was to extend these findings to test critical aspects of suicide prevention billboard messaging. Although both simulated billboard messages presented had iden- tical supporting messages, we predicted that the more personal billboard message, focused on saving one's life, would cause more favorable help-seeking attitudes than the message focused on suicide.

    "Specifically, the focus is on public awareness cam- paigns. Despite the proliferation of suicide prevention campaigns over the last three decades, many of the campaigns have not been rigorously studied and lack an empirical basis (4, 5). Some suicide prevention efforts fail to produce the desired outcomes.",
    "Some approaches may even inadvertently produce iatrogenic effects. Possible iatrogenic effects include messages that normalize suicidal behavior, reinforce biases that prevent individuals from seeking help, or heighten susceptibility for suicide contagion",
    "[e.g., Ref. (5, 6)].",
    "More research is needed to validate the effectiveness of suicide prevention campaigns, before taking them to scale. There are numerous challenges to evaluating suicide prevention programs.",
    "For example, it is difficult to show treatment effective- ness among infrequently occurring behaviors, such as deaths by suicide or even suicide attempts (7). The U.S. Surgeon General has called for researchers to develop alternative methods for evaluat- ing suicide prevention efforts beyond simply a reduction in the number of suicides (8).",
    "Intermediate measures of intervention effectiveness include assessing changes in help-seeking attitudes and behaviors (9, 10). Help-seeking is defined as the act of seeking assistance from an informal (e.g., friend) or formal (e.g., mental health profes- sional) source (11). Help-seeking is thought to be a critical step between understanding that there is a problem and seeking out the necessary services for assistance (12). Barriers to help-seeking include stigma and other maladaptive beliefs [e.g., Ref.",
    "(13, 14)]. Increased help-seeking is associated with lower suicide risk (15). If prevention programs are to succeed, help-seeking must be promoted. And yet, there is mixed evidence if suicide preven- tion efforts are effective at increasing help-seeking attitudes and behaviors, especially in those who are at high risk for suicide (9).",
    "Similarly, despite the evidence that many individuals who experience depressive symptoms or suicidal ideation use more maladaptive coping and isolative behaviors (15), there is mixed evidence if preventive interventions alter maladaptive coping strategies (16, 17). It is a priority to promote enhanced adaptive attitudes and behaviors.",
    "There is a limited understanding of what features of suicide prevention public awareness campaigns show the most impact. Some strides have been made in assessing the acceptability and impact of public service announcements (PSAs) through the media (e.g., TV ads, radio ads, websites) or printed material (e.g., billboards, flyers, posters).",
    "Often these campaigns target white, adult males, the group that accounts for the highest risk of suicide, or target significant others who may serve as sources of referral (e.g., wives, girlfriends, friends). For example, Daigle et al. (18) measured the efficacy of a multimedia-based prevention approach (via radio, television, and billboards) intended at reducing suicide rates among males in Quebec, Canada.",
    "They exclusively evaluated the results of this campaign and targeted a male audience (e.g., Pain is not gender-specific - yet 80% of suicides are committed by men). Male participants exposed to the campaigns gained more knowledge of suicide facts and resources, yet there was no evidence that the campaigns impacted the participant's intention to utilize mental health services.",
    "Given that universal prevention efforts are viewed by all ages, the impact has also been assessed in other groups, even for groups that were not the target of the campaign. That is, while the target group is rarely adolescents or young adults",
    "[for an exception, see Ref. (19)], research is needed for this age group as they are at highest risk of iatrogenic effects of suicide prevention efforts",
    "[e.g., Ref. (6)]. A series of simulation studies evaluated the benefits and risks associated with viewing a PSA.",
    "In one study, high school students were randomly assigned to a billboard, a TV ad, or a no information condition. The results revealed some concerns about the effectiveness of PSAs, particularly the billboard condition with high-risk youth (20). When this study was conducted with college students, those in the billboard condition were less likely to endorse adaptive help-seeking attitudes than those in the no information condition or in the TV ad condition (1).",
    "The results of these findings led the authors to conclude that this particular billboard was largely without benefits. The researchers also noted that it remains unclear if the modality (billboard) or message (e.g., content of the message) accounted for the unfavorable outcomes associated with viewing this billboard. The purpose of this study was to examine individual dif- ferences in help-seeking attitudes, knowledge of maladaptive coping behaviors, and reported concerns about PSA exposure among young adults in response to two different simulated billboard messages and a simulated TV ad.",
    "Here, our goal was to evaluate if subtle features of the simulated billboard message made a difference. The two messages assessed were identical in every way (e.g., the call to action was see your doctor) with the exception of the central message (either the original message - Prevent Suicide: Treat Depression or the alternative message - Stop depression from taking another life).",
    "The wording on the alternative billboard was intended to motivate the viewer by being more personal, by stressing the benefits valued by the intended audience that offset the costs of taking action (21), and by having the viewer consider the implicit directive of acting to save one's life. Additionally, the alternative billboard was intended to decrease psychiatric jargon and avoid the possible stigma associated with the word \"suicide\" (22). The hope is that this work will promote a better understanding of the utility of campaign messages so that the intended goal of saving lives can be more fully realized.",

    "Dependent Variables Help-Seeking Attitudes and Maladaptive Coping The help-seeking attitudes and endorsement of maladaptive coping behavior scales were adapted from Gould et al. (15), who reported Cronbach's alpha coefficients of 0.60 for the help-seeking and 0.54 for the maladaptive coping scale based on scales derived from factor analysis. The five-item help-seeking attitudes scale required par- ticipants to rate their response to a suicidal friend on a five-point scale (0 = \"never\" to 4 = \"always\") on a number of help-seeking behaviors (i.e., get advice from another friend, tell my friend to see a mental health professional, tell my friend to call a hotline, talk to an adult about my friend, tell my friend to talk to his or her parents).",

Three items were on the same five-point scale as the help-seeking questions that were converted to agree-disagree statements. The total number of maladaptive coping behaviors endorsed was calculated for each participant.",

    "Universal suicide prevention efforts hold great promise in reach- ing many in need. Nevertheless, the lessons learned in research conducted over the last 30 years have curtailed enthusiasm for PSAs, as these campaigns have limitations for communicating critical information and potential iatrogenic risks [e.g., Ref.",
    "(5, 25)]. Emerging evidence suggests that theory-driven develop- ment and empirical assessment of message content for suicide should be the gold standard (26), but the current state of the field is inchoate (27).",
    "Additionally, because PSA exposure may not be limited to the target population, it is also critical to determine the efficacy and safety for other potentially vulnerable popula- tions who may incidentally view PSAs. It is possible that specific formats or messages may have an important impact on the viewer. While progress in developing effective suicide prevention PSAs may be uneven, it is likely that using theoretically guided, practi- cal steps to validate the effectiveness of PSAs will ultimately prove to be beneficial for the society.",
    "The results of this study replicate and extend previous research regarding the utility of PSAs. Specifically, the findings are consist- ent with previous work showing that the original billboard was not as effective as the TV ad [e.g., Ref. (1, 20)].",
    "The TV ad conveys information about the common symptoms of depression, imbeds the topic of suicide into a broader discussion of depression, and provides more extensive information about services for treating depressive symptoms and preventing suicide. Increasing the indi- viduals' knowledge and awareness of services has been found to be a crucial factor in ensuring media messages are acted on (28).",
    "Importantly, the results of this study suggest that some bill- board messages may yield changes in attitudes that are nearly comparable to the TV ad. Specifically, in this study, we showed that attitudes toward help-seeking were favorably influenced by the alternative billboard message (\"Stop depression from taking another life\"), but not the original message (\"Prevent suicide: Treat depression\").",
    "Previously, Klimes-Dougan and Lee (1) spec- ulated that some billboards may contain an insufficient \"dose\" of information for changing attitudes. But the results of this study suggest that the amount of information conveyed in a billboard may not be a critical factor.",
    "In this study, all wording was exactly the same in both the billboards other than the central message (so, in total, there were only two words more in the alternative billboard). By contrast, the findings of this study suggest that brief messaging may be useful if the wording of the message is crafted to maximize benefits for the viewer. Some have pointed out the advantages of using a straightforward and succinct message",
    "[e.g., Ref. (29)].",
    "It will be important to better understand the features of the alternative billboard message - \"Stop depression from taking another life\" that are most useful. Not only is this message succinct",
    "but also it may be more personally relevant, more appealing, and possibly even, inspire intervention. Additionally, the less explicit reference to suicide in the alternative billboard message may be less off-putting. Nevertheless, it remains somewhat surprising that in some respects, the alternative billboard shows similarly favorable outcomes as the TA ad, especially given the depth of information that is conveyed in the TV ad.",
    "Contrary to the predictions, we failed to show that at-risk participants were more vulnerable to the negative effects of any of the simulated PSAs. Previous research with PSAs has shown that those who reported depressive symptoms and/or previous suicide attempts were the least likely to endorse positive help- seeking attitudes and the most likely to see a strong link between depression and suicide, particularly for the original billboard (20). The results of this study fail to show evidence that the responses differed across PSA conditions.",
    "However, consistent with other work that shows an association between depressive symptoms and help-seeking attitudes or behaviors (15, 30, 31), the results of this study did suggest that the most vulnerable individuals were more likely to endorse maladaptive coping strategies. Future research should continue to examine the utility of personaliza- tion for suicide prevention campaigns, for what might be useful for those at high risk may not be useful for those at low risk for suicide.",
    "There are some important contributions of this study as well as interpretational cautions that should be highlighted. The ran- domized assignment of the participants to exposure conditions (despite some variations in randomization procedures across classrooms) provides an important design that lends itself to causal implications.",
    "Research using a pretest and posttest design may further aid conclusions by showing how outcome variables change after viewing a PSA. Additionally, the relatively large, homogeneous group of young adult participants provided suf- ficient power to detect small effect sizes.",
    "There are measurement issues that need to be addressed in future research, given the moderate internal consistency of the scales (e.g., maladaptive coping), the distribution of responses, and the inconsistent find- ings across scales (despite the fact that the maladaptive coping scale is related to the help-seeking scale, r = -0.23). Additionally, this study examined endorsed attitudes after viewing a PSA, and not the actual behaviors.",
    "It would have been ideal to also know if young adults who viewed PSAs were more likely to reach out to family members, friends, or professionals to get help for themselves or others who are struggling with suicidal thoughts. Second, there are limitations regarding generalizability of the results given that the majority of the participants were white, female college students selected from behavioral science courses. In some respects, the characteristics of these participants may have been ideal.",
    "Namely, this campaign was specifically intended for females (e.g., friends, spouses etc., of those who are at high risk for suicide - white males) so it may be useful to have a greater proportion of females, particularly at-risk females. However, given that, we know suicide prevention efforts differ for males and females (32, 33) and there are robust sex differences for suicide attempts and deaths, a more equally distributed sample of males and females might have been preferable in some respects.",
    "It will be important to ask the question, how representative are PSA simulation studies of real-world conditions? While simulation designs provide well-controlled exposure (e.g., a 5 s Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org",
    "July 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 124 Effect of Billboard Messaging Klimes-Dougan et al. viewing of the simulated billboard), the exposure is likely to vary significantly under natural conditions. For example, participants viewing a billboard from a car may be focused primarily on traffic, perhaps only briefly glancing at the message or missing the message completely.",
    "Increasingly, cluttered media environ- ments make achieving adequate exposure to media campaigns more difficult, rather than making wider exposure easier (28). Also, in this study, there was only one exposure to this simulated billboard message.",
    "In real-world contexts, some people may experience repeated exposures to the messaging, potentially based on the placement of the billboards and an individual's transportation patterns or TV viewing patterns. The salience of the messaging is also important.",
    "But, while some public health topics provide provocative messaging that is readily recalled (as the recent \"Cover your Butt\" colonoscopy billboard campaign), it is incumbent upon preventionists to be cautious in suicide pre- vention messaging. Finally, continued scrutiny of the messages may be worthwhile. For example, contrary to suicide messaging guidelines (34), there may be some ways in which the imperative of the alternative billboard is not ideal.",
    "For example, \" ... taking another life\" may imply that that lives are \"taken\" with some regularity and that suicide is normative. It will be important to continue to refine messaging strategies and back these modifica- tions with empirical evidence. Given that messaging may not be uniformly effective across participants, future research should also address the important questions of which suicide prevention approaches are best, and which are best for whom.",
    "Due to the significant impact suicide continues to have on the lives around the world, further research is needed to develop and improve effective suicide prevention campaigns so that more can benefit. cOnclUsiOn Suicide remains a serious public health challenge worldwide and is among the top causes of death for young adults (2).",
    "There is great promise in media campaigns as they afford the opportunity to present well-defined messages to large audiences repeatedly, over time, at a low cost. However, this promise is rarely realized because media campaigns can fall short or even backfire (28). In an effort to do something, preventionists have often moved ahead in the absence of firm empirical grounding. The results of this study provide some optimism that carefully crafted billboard messages may favorably influence help-seeking attitudes of participants.",

    "Problem setting. Due to the rapid development of digital technologies, the issue of status settlement and the use of artificial intelligence technologies is especially relevant.",
    "This fact indicates the need and importance of finding answers to the question and aims to intensify and unite the efforts of the scientific community to address relevant issues. One of the areas of scientific research is the doctrinal development of new phenomena and ISSN 2075-7190.",
    "No. 2 (49) processes that have arisen and are taking place in the state and legal sphere under the influence of digitalization of economics, management and law. The tasks of scientific research are to comprehend the impact of the digitization process on the state and legal sphere of society; law as such; assessment of the transformations that are taking place and identification of trends in their dynamics; forecasting the state of these phenomena in the future; formulation of fundamental and applied problems of legal science in terms of doctrinal development of the laws of development and functioning of law, state and legal sphere of society in the conditions of digital reality, determination of approaches to their solution.",
    "Recent research and publications analysis. An analysis of recent research and publications shows that scientific research on this issue is carried out mainly within the economic, political, computer, legal sciences, although the problems and prospects of digitization of law require a deep and thorough philosophical, including philosophical and legal understanding. The rapid development of new technologies, in particular artificial intelligence technologies, the Internet of Things, cloud technologies, etc., is contributing to changes in current legislation. Today, advanced economies are already pondering the question of regulating the status and use of AI technologies.",
    "While these are only the first bold steps, in the future, all of these can affect global changes in the legal system - perhaps full-fledged comprehensive institutions of law, even the branches of law. Paper objective. The purpose of this article is a philosophical and legal understanding of the impact of digitalization on the state and legal sphere of society and law as such.",
    "Paper main body. One of the practical aspects of digitalization is the manifestation of the state's ability to provide various services.",
    "If necessary, citizens receive certificates, records, statements, responses to electronic inquiries, electronic payments. Other practical aspects, provided that these technologies are used wisely, can improve welfare in education, public safety, and health. In addition, digital imaging can also help address common global issues, such as climate change and greater access to health care and mobility.",
    "At the same time, according to many researchers, along with the benefits of digital technologies, including artificial intelligence, new types of ethical issues are being raised, namely compliance with legal ethics standards by artificial intelligence systems and justice, the most important of which are respect for human rights and democratic values. , as well as the danger of transferring prejudices from the analog to the digital world.",
    "Researchers have linked the legal challenges of using artificial intelligence technologies in legal practice to a number of issues. In particular, with such as: ensuring data confidentiality; access to confidential law enforcement information; lack of regulatory framework for the use of artificial intelligence systems in legal practice; protection of intellectual property; risk assessment of the use of artificial intelligence systems by a lawyer when working with a client; other potential problems of lawyer's liability; dangers of unauthorized access and modification of artificial intelligence systems by attackers; damage to artificial intelligence systems by malicious virus programs; violation of the terms of providing advice from artificial intelligence systems in case of technical problems, etc.",

    "It is obvious that the transformations in society associated with these processes require new approaches to the development of national policies for the digitalization of society, which should be based on international agreements. Due to these transformations, there is a need to develop strategic documents that will regulate this area. These documents should be flexible and designed to take into account the maximum amount of data, as well as ensure the free development of innovative technologies and prevent possible risks.",
    "Issues of development of the digital economy and society of Ukraine do not fully meet today's conditions, not enough account is taken of the transformations that have emerged and are currently taking place both in law and in the field of legal regulation under the influence of digitalization. Digital technologies are able to change the image of law, to influence its regulatory potential and efficiency, to open the way or to block its action in new dimensions of social reality. Traditional rather than digital vision of law, legal technologies and certain types of legal activity by legislators is a consequence of the lack of relevant scientific developments that will identify and explain the impact of the digitization process on the law and the legal sphere of society.",
    "The practical need for this kind of research is now greater than ever. In order to satisfy it, scientists should intensify work in this direction.",
    "Conclusions of the research. The new digital reality puts forward new requirements for legal science and legal practice, including the development of effective tools and models of legal regulation of various spheres of public life. In modern conditions, law becomes not only a means, a tool that provides digitalization of the economy, government and other segments of social life, but also the object of digitalization. With the development of digital technologies, the contradiction between the need for quality both in terms of form and content of regulations, as well as the ability to meet it in a short time.",

Objective--To test the effectiveness of 3 methods to frame financial incentives to increase physical activity among overweight and obese adults.",
    "Design--Randomized, controlled trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT 02030119)",
    "Setting--University of Pennsylvania. Participants--281 adult employees (body mass index >=27 kg/m2).",
    "Intervention--13-week intervention. Participants had a goal of 7000 steps per day and were randomly assigned to a control group with daily feedback or 1 of 3 financial incentive programs with daily feedback: a gain incentive ($1.40 given each day the goal was achieved), lottery incentive (daily eligibility [expected value approximately $1.40] if goal was achieved), or loss incentive ($42 allocated monthly upfront and $1.40 removed each day the goal was not achieved). Participants were followed for another 13 weeks with daily performance feedback but no incentives.",
    "Measurements--Primary outcome was the mean proportion of participant-days that the 7000- step goal was achieved during the intervention. Secondary outcomes included the mean proportion of participant-days achieving the goal during follow-up and the mean daily steps during intervention and follow-up.",
    "Results--The mean proportion of participant-days achieving the goal was 0.30 (95% CI, 0.22 to 0.37) in the control group, 0.35 (CI, 0.28 to 0.42) in the gain-incentive group, 0.36 (CI, 0.29 to 0.43) in the lottery-incentive group, and 0.45 (CI, 0.38 to 0.52) in the loss-incentive group. In adjusted analyses, only the loss-incentive group had a significantly greater mean proportion of participant-days achieving the goal than control (adjusted difference, 0.16 [CI, 0.06 to 0.26]; P = 0.001), but the adjusted difference in mean daily steps was not significant (861 [CI, 24 to 1746]; P = 0.056). During follow-up, daily steps decreased for all incentive groups and were not different from control.",
    "Limitation--Single employer. Conclusion--Financial incentives framed as a loss were most effective for achieving physical activity goals. Primary Funding Source--National Institute on Aging.",
    "Higher levels of regular physical activity are associated with lower rates of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and all-cause mortality (1-5). However, more than half of adults in the United States do not attain the minimum recommended level of physical activity to have these health benefits (6, 7).",
    "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Ann Intern Med. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 July 03. AuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscript Patel et al.",
    "Page 3 and many state public health departments have recommended the workplace as an environment to implement interventions to increase physical activity (8-11). But evidence suggests that most workplace physical activity interventions are not effective, particularly for more sedentary persons (12-14).",
    "Workplace wellness programs are growing in popularity throughout the United States, and more than 80% of large employers now use some form of financial incentive for health promotion (15-17). Beginning in 2014, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act increased the proportion of employee health insurance premiums that can be used as outcome-based wellness incentives from 20% to 30% and as high as 50% if tobacco use is targeted (18, 19).",
    "This provides a significant opportunity to use incentive-based programs to change health behaviors, but the optimal design of financial incentives to increase physical activity has not been well-examined (20). Behavioral economics incorporates principles from psychology to help understand why persons make decisions that are not in line with longer-term health goals. Many persons know physical activity is good for their health but do not do enough of it.",
    "Instead, they often deviate from these goals in a predictable manner and from a common set of decision errors (18, 19, 21). For example, persons tend to be more motivated by immediate rather than delayed gratification (22) and by losses rather than gains (23), and they tend to avoid the feeling of regret (24).",
    "These insights reveal that the design and delivery of an incentive has an important influence on its effectiveness. The objective of this study was to test the effectiveness of 3 financial incentive designs, each with the same expected economic value.",
    "In the gain-incentive group, participants received a fixed amount of money each day the step goal was achieved. This design follows traditional economic principles in that it is largely transactional: A certain constant reward is promised for a predetermined effort. Persons in the 2 other incentive groups were offered incentives of the same expected value, but those incentives were designed to leverage the fact that persons tend to be loss averse, are more engaged by variable reinforcement than by constant reinforcement, and tend to avoid the feeling of regret.",
    "Methods Design Overview We conducted a 26-week randomized, controlled trial between 6 March and 6 September 2014, consisting of 13-week intervention and follow-up periods. A total of 281 participants gave their informed consent and were randomly assigned to a control group or to 1 of 3 groups with different financial incentive designs, each with the same expected economic value.",
    "All participants were given a goal of achieving at least 7000 steps per day, and this target reflects several deliberate design elements. First, this level of physical activity is endorsed by the American College of Sports Medicine to be approximately equivalent to meeting the federal guidelines for the minimum recommended levels of physical activity needed to achieve health benefits (25, 26).",

    "Prior studies using an even higher goal of 10 000 steps have found that more sedentary persons may be less likely to participate, and it was a priority in this study to engage as many persons as possible (12). Third, instead of simply asking participants to increase steps, a minimum threshold puts greater emphasis on encouraging more sedentary persons to be physically active and less emphasis on getting highly active persons to be even more active.",
    "Step counts were tracked using the Moves smart-phone application (ProtoGeo Oy), which uses accelerometers within the phone and has been shown by our prior work to be accurate (29). Each participant was given a unique personal identification number to enter into the smartphone application and verify permission that the study team could access step-count data.",
    "Once the application was installed on the phone, the participant never had to reopen it, although they could as often as they wished. Instead, participants had to allow the application to run passively on the phone, have the phone powered on, and carry it with them (for example, in a pocket or on a belt clip or arm band) while they were active.",
    "The University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board approved this study. Setting and Participants Eligible participants were employees of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, were aged 18 years or older, and had a body mass index (BMI) of at least 27 kg/m2 (estimated from self-reported height and weight). We chose this BMI threshold to help ensure that our sample represented overweight or obese persons.",
    "Participants were recruited by e-mail from February to March 2014 and excluded if they were already participating in another physical activity study, were not able or willing to carry an iPhone (Apple) or Android (Google) smartphone with the mobile application installed, were pregnant or lactating, intended to become pregnant within 6 months, or stated that they could not complete the study. E-mails were sent to all University of Pennsylvania staff employees (approximately 10 000 persons).",
    "All eligible participants provided electronic informed consent, completed a sociodemographic questionnaire, self-reported measures of height and weight, and reported recent physical activity using the long form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (30). Randomization and Interventions Participants enrolled online using Way to Health, an automated technology platform based at the University of Pennsylvania that integrates wireless devices, conducts clinical trial randomization and enrollment processes, delivers messaging (text message or e-mail) and surveys, automates transfers of financial incentives, and securely captures data for research purposes (31). Way to Health was used in prior behavioral intervention studies (32-34).",
    "All participants received $25 for enrolling and $75 for participating through the primary end point at 13 weeks along with completion of a survey on their experience. However, there was no participation incentive for the follow-up period. Participants were mailed a bank check at the end of each month with all accumulated earnings.",

For 26 weeks, participants in all 4 groups received daily feedback on whether they had achieved the 7000-step goal in the prior day. The control group received no other intervention aside from daily feedback.",
    "For the 13-week intervention, the intervention groups included a gain incentive in which participants received $1.40 for each day they met the goal, a loss incentive in which $1.40 was taken away from a monthly incentive ($42 allocated upfront) each time the daily goal was not met, or a daily lottery incentive. Persons in the lottery-incentive group selected a 2-digit number between 00 and 99. One winning number was randomly selected daily during the intervention period.",
    "If a participant's number had a single-digit match (an 18% chance), he or she won $5. If the participant's number had a 2-digit match (a 1% chance), he or she won $50.",
    "Participants were eligible to collect the reward only if the 7000-step goal was achieved on the prior day. Ineligible participants were informed what they would have won if they had achieved the goal, drawing on evidence that the desire to avoid regret can be motivating (23, 24, 35, 36).",
    "Incentives were offered only during the 13-week intervention, but daily performance feedback was delivered for the entire 26 weeks. Outcomes and Follow-up The primary outcome was the mean proportion of participant-days that the 7000-step goal was achieved during the 13-week intervention. We hypothesized that participants in all 3 financial-incentive groups would have a significantly greater mean proportion of participant- days achieving the goal than the control group, with participants in the loss- and lottery- incentive groups performing the best.",
    "Secondary outcomes included the number of steps per day during intervention and follow-up and the mean proportion of participant-days that the 7000-step goal was achieved during follow-up. Neither the participants nor the study coordinator could be blinded to the group assignment. All investigators, statisticians, and data analysts were blinded to group assignments until the 26-week study ended.",
    "Statistical Analysis One participant randomly assigned to the gain-incentive group was later found to be ineligible because of enrollment in another physical activity study. One participant randomly assigned to the lottery-incentive group switched to a phone that was not eligible for use before the study began and therefore did not receive the intervention.",
    "Both of these participants were excluded from the analysis. All other randomly assigned participants were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. For each participant on each day of the study (participant-day level), we obtained the number of steps achieved as a continuous variable.",
    "Data could be missing for any day if a participant turned off the smart-phone or the application, disabled the study team's permission before data were accessed, or did not carry the smartphone at all. For the main analysis, we used only collected data (a step-count value was received). This approach is based on the assumption that missing data occur at random and do not bias outcomes for Ann Intern Med.",
    "Page 6 groups with differing levels of missing data. Using the continuous steps data, we estimated the mean daily steps among participants in each group during the intervention and follow- up. We dichotomized the data at the participant-day level to create a binary variable indicating that the participant achieved the 7000-step goal (value, 1) or did not achieve it (value, 0). Using this binary variable, we estimated the mean proportion of participant-days achieving the goal for the group of participants in each group during the intervention and follow-up and for each week during the study.",
    "For adjusted analyses, we used PROC GLIMMIX in SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute), to fit a generalized linear model with participant random effects, a random intercept, time-fixed effects (at the weekly level), and treatment-fixed effects (by study group) (37-40).",
    "We assumed a normal distribution for models using the continuous outcome and obtained the difference in steps among groups using the least-squares means (LSMEANS) command. We assumed a binomial distribution with logit link for models using the binary outcome to estimate adjusted difference in the proportion of participant-days achieving the goal and used the bootstrap procedure, resampling participants, to obtain 95% confidence intervals and P values (41, 42).",
    "We used a pseudolikelihood method (38) but also performed a sensitivity analysis for the main models using the quadrature approximation with 12 nodes specified (43). Several sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of our findings. For the primary and secondary outcomes using the binary and continuous variables, respectively, the main model was further adjusted by using device-fixed effects for smartphone type (iPhone or Android).",
    "The model was also evaluated by using all data and coding missing data (when a step value was not received) as \"not achieving the goal\" (in contrast to using only collected data), which is a method used in prior work (33). Further, evidence suggests that step-count values less than 1000 are unlikely to represent accurate data capture of actual activity (27, 44, 45). Therefore, to avoid these observations from downward biasing mean daily step outcomes, we did a sensitivity analysis using the model with values less than 1000 excluded from the sample.",
    "A priori, we estimated that a sample of at least 260 participants (65 per group) would ensure 80% power to detect a 0.20 difference between each intervention group and the control group. We used a conservative Bonferroni adjustment of the type I error rate with a 2-sided a value of 0.017.",
    "This calculation assumed that the mean proportion of participant-days achieving the goal in the control group would be 0.40. We increased the participant enrollment target to 280 to account for a potential 8% dropout rate.",

    "The percentage of participant-days on which step-count data were missing during the intervention was 15% for the control group, 10% for the gain- incentive group, 18% for the lottery-incentive group, and 13% for loss-incentive group. The mean proportion of participant-days that the 7000-step goal was achieved at the weekly level peaked at about 0.48 in the loss-incentive group, 0.42 in the lottery-incentive group, and 0.41 in the gain-incentive group, but it was never greater than 0.33 in the control group (Figure 2).",

    "Adjusted differences in mean daily steps are displayed in Table 4. The loss-incentive group had greater mean daily steps than the control group, but they were not significantly different (adjusted difference, 861 steps [CI, 24 to 1746 steps]; P = 0.056).",
    "During follow-up, the mean proportion of participant-days achieving the goal decreased among all groups. The loss-incentive group had the greatest mean proportion of participant- days achieving the goal (0.30",

    "Sensitivity analyses using the quadrature approximation supported the findings of the main models using the pseudolikelihood method for both mean proportion of participant-days achieving the goal and mean daily steps (Appendix Tables 1 and 2, available at www.annals.org). No adverse events were reported during the entire study.",
    "Discussion Employers are increasingly using workplace wellness programs to target health outcomes. Although the popularity of these programs is growing, the optimal design of financial incentives to change health behaviors is uncertain. In this randomized, controlled trial using financial incentives to increase physical activity, we found that the design of the incentive Ann Intern Med.",
    "Page 8 significantly influenced outcomes. The gain incentive, in which an employee received a fixed amount each day he or she met goal, was no more effective than control.",
    "In comparison, a loss incentive, in which rewards were allocated upfront and taken away each day the goal was not achieved, resulted in a 50% relative increase in the mean proportion of time participants achieved physical activity goals. These findings expand our understanding of using financial incentives to increase physical activity.",
    "A study by Finkelstein and colleagues (46) enrolled 51 adults and randomly assigned them to a control group in which each participant received $75 to participate or an intervention group in which each participant received $50 to participate plus $10, $15, or $25 more per week depending on their level of physical activity. The intervention group achieved 1.8 more hours of physical activity per week at an average cost of $17.50, but the study duration was only 4 weeks and there was no follow-up without incentives. A meta-analysis (20) evaluated the use of financial incentives to increase exercise adherence.",
    "Seven randomized, controlled trials were included in the final analysis. Although pooled results indicated that incentives were effective, the optimal design of incentives was not well-evaluated. The weekly incentive ranged from $2.79 to $46.82, but most studies delivered incentives only at the end of the study. The authors of the meta-analysis concluded that the quality of existing evidence was poor and that they could not draw reasonable conclusions about the effect of incentive design on physical activity outcomes.",
    "In comparison, our study had an expected value of $9.80 per week and incentives were designed to be delivered daily because persons tend to prefer immediate gratification rather than delayed rewards (22). Our findings add new insight and indicate that the same magnitude of incentives can have a significantly different effect on outcomes depending on how the incentive is designed. Specifically, financial incentives might be more effective if their design moved beyond a mere transaction and instead reflected predictable opportunities to enhance behavior change (18, 19, 21).",
    "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended that the workplace may be a good environment to implement wellness programs to target changes in health outcomes, such as increasing physical activity (8). However, there is some concern that these programs are not benefiting less healthy employees and instead simply increasing their cost burden (47). For example, programs that have been shown to be effective at changing behaviors among more sedentary persons are lacking (48-50).",
    "Evidence suggests that workplace interventions tend to better engage more motivated persons with higher baseline physical activity levels (12). However, those who may benefit more from these interventions probably have less motivation and lower baseline physical activity levels. In our study, employees had a mean BMI of 33.2 kg/m2, which is one indication that these participants may be more sedentary (51).",
    "Among the 279 participants who received the intervention, 269 (96.4%) remained in the study at 13 weeks. No financial incentives were provided during follow-up, but participants continued to receive daily performance feedback. By 26 weeks, 267 participants (95.7% of those who started; 99.3% of those who reached 13 weeks) remained in the study.",
    "These high engagement rates may indicate that the methods used in this study show promise for better engaging overweight and obese persons. Ann Intern Med. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2018 July 03.",
    "AuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscript Patel et al. Page 9",
    "Many employers have become more interested in using wearable and mobile devices in wellness programs (52). Based on our findings, a smartphone-based approach to data collection resulted in high engagement probably because it required little additional effort from the participants other than carrying the device (which they may already be accustomed to doing). Because more than two thirds of adults in the United States have a smartphone (53, 54) and these devices are accurate for tracking step counts (29), smartphones may be a more scalable method to deploy interventions that track physical activity. Although our findings show promise for the role of smartphones in monitoring behaviors, they also confirm the notion that these technologies must be combined with carefully tested behavior change strategies to effectively improve health outcomes (52).",
    "Future studies might compare alternate methods of using loss aversion to design incentives and could further test the optimal magnitude and frequency. Insights from this study should be incorporated into evaluations of longer-term sustainability and may benefit from opportunities to incorporate social incentives, such as team-based designs that focus on peer support, teammate accountability, and unity toward a common goal (52).",
    "Our study has several limitations. First, participants were from a single employer in Philadelphia, which may limit generalizability because physical activity is harder in some regions with different climate, outdoor space, and culture.",
    "Second, participants needed a smartphone, which potentially makes participation less likely for those without such a device. Third, participants' physical activity was not tracked when they were not carrying their smartphones; thus, the captured physical activity levels may be lower than their actual activity. At the end of the intervention, however, about 93% of respondents stated that they carried their smart-phone most or all of the time.",
    "Fourth, we did not obtain data on baseline step counts, but randomization resulted in well-balanced study groups. Therefore, outcomes among groups may reflect the differential effectiveness of interventions. In addition, self- reported physical activity did not differ among groups; however, these data seem to reflect overestimates of baseline activity because step-count data indicate that our population may be less physically active than they initially reported.",
    "Finally, our study was not well-powered to detect smaller differences or do comparisons among the intervention groups. In addition, the continuous outcome measure had a wider distribution than anticipated and we did not have enough statistical power to adequately detect differences among study groups.",
    "In summary, more than half of adults in the United States do not attain the minimum recommended level of physical activity to achieve health benefits. Although the popularity of wellness programs and the use of mobile technologies to monitor health outcomes are rising, there has been a lack of rigorous study evaluating their effectiveness and the optimal design of financial incentives had not been well-examined.",
    "Our findings suggest that the design of financial incentives is important and that incorporating insights from behavioral economics may significantly improve their effectiveness. Acknowledgments Grant Support: By the National Institute on Aging (grant RC4 AG039114; Drs.",

    "The article is devoted to the analysis of the content of the institute of legal restrictions imposed on a woman who is in the civil service and performs tasks in the field of public administration. On the basis of the provisions of acts of international law and the laws of Ukraine on Civil Service, found that for women - civil servants subject to special legal restrictions, which are provided by law bans involvement of women in certain forms of their professional duties and tasks for narrowing their total workload to preserve their health and create conditions for full implementation of the social function of the mother. The main results of the study.",
    "It is proved that the relevant legislation on public service both Ukraine imposed restrictions on female civil servant to attract her to the tasks of public administration and, at the same time, it focused on social protection. This approach is contributes to the establishment of a regime of \"normal living conditions for civil servants.",
    "In particular, under the law relating to limiting women's participation in official missions, limiting working hours for women, limitations associated with the transfer of female civil servant to another location and so on. Particular attention is paid to the specifics of women's performance in the field of public administration of defense and national security. It is established that many legal restrictions for women in these areas are not always observed. In particular, attention is focused on unequal age conditions for concluding a contract for military service for women, the established age limit for female conscripts, regardless of service, and the ability of men to serve in the army for 15 years longer than women.",
    "The latest changes in the legislation to correct this situation are also disclosed. Conclusions.",
    "It is noted that the legal restrictions provided for in the legislation, which are provided for women involved in public administration, despite their positive impact, narrow in some way the scope of their professional opportunities, as well as limit the actual ability to exercise power. However, their inherent social nature and the state must provide adequate compensatory mechanisms stimulating professional activity of women civil servants and minimize the impact on female civil servant consequences relevant restrictions. In its turn, optimal administration of such measures is intended to increase not only the professional performance of women as public administrators, but also enhance the social effectiveness of public administration in general.

    "Cooperative biological engagement programs act to build partnerships and collaborations between scientists and health professionals to strengthen capabilities in biosurveillance. Biosurveillance is the systematic process of detecting, reporting, and responding to especially dangerous pathogens and pathogens of pandemic potential before they become outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics. One important tool in biosurveillance is next generation sequencing.",
    "Expensive sequencing machines, reagents, and supplies make it difficult for countries to adopt this technology. Cooperative engagement programs help by providing funding for technical assistance to strengthen sequencing capabilities. Through workshops and training, countries are able to learn sequencing and bioinformatics, and implement these tools in their biosurveillance programs.",
    "Cooperative programs have an important role in building and sustaining collaborations among institutions and countries. One of the most important pieces in fostering these collaborations is trust. Trust provides the confidence that a successful collaboration will benefit all parties involved.",
    "With sequencing, this enables the sharing of pathogen samples and sequences. Obtaining global sequencing data helps to identify unknown etiological agents, track pathogen evolution and infer transmission networks throughout the duration of a pandemic. Having sequencing technology in place for biosurveillance generates the capacity to provide real-time data to understand and respond to pandemics.",
    "We highlight the need for these programs to continue to strengthen sequencing in biosurveillance. By working together to strengthen sequencing capabilities, trust can be formed, benefitting global health in the face of biological threats.",

    "Strengthening Sequencing Through Cooperative Engagement (1-4). Preventing and dealing with the consequences of these diseases requires a global effort.",
    "Cooperative engagement programs are designed to build and strengthen capabilities and capacities in biosurveillance, biosecurity, and biosafety around the world. These programs aim to create, foster, and sustain international collaborations among health professionals, disease diagnostic laboratories, and infectious disease scientists (5, 6).",
    "They primarily focus on especially dangerous pathogens and pathogens of pandemic potential, and include those that may be used in bioterrorism. These programs have been implemented in the United States, Canada, Germany, and other countries with the goal of reducing the threat of infectious diseases by promoting global health security.",
    "One aspect of cooperative engagement programs is to build, promote, and strengthen biosurveillance capabilities. Biosurveillance is \"the ongoing systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health data, essential to the planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health practice, closely integrated with the timely dissemination of these data to those who need to know and linked to prevention and control\" (7, 8).",
    "Early detection of pathogens is crucial for mitigation efforts and to limit the spread of a pathogen before it grows from a small outbreak to a larger epidemic or pandemic. One critical tool in biosurveillance and early detection has now become sequencing. Sequencing is not just a critical toolit can also play a major role in pandemic response.",
    "Here, we discuss the importance of cooperative engagement programs in strengthening sequencing capabilities in countries around the world. in biosurveillance, COOPERATIVE ENGAGEMENT PROGRAMS STRENGTHEN BIOSURVEILLANCE AND RESEARCH CAPABILITIES training and support these programs is trust. Trust Cooperative engagement programs bring together researchers, scientists, and health professionals from all over the world with the shared goal of reducing the threat of infectious diseases (5, 6).",
    "These programs help to establish and strengthen both biosurveillance efforts and research capabilities to answer important questions regarding infectious diseases (Figure 1). A vital consequence ofis formed in the initial capacity building for sequencing and biosurveillance through reachback efforts.",
    "Reachback is the technical institutions. Participating countries and institutions can also help each other to perform sequencing and to analyze sequence data, which further enhances relationships. Once the sequencing capability is built, sustaining this capability is challenging; sequencing technology and bioinformatics tools are constantly changing and labs need to keep purchasing supplies and reagents.",
    "Collaborations, research networks and projects, and reachback support are important pieces to sustainability. These allow participating countries to continue to actively use sequencing and bioinformatics tools to answer important questions regarding, for example, pathogen biology and disease distribution.",
    "Cooperative from partner engagement programs help build the initial capacity and continue to play a role in sustaining these capabilities. Every country is at a different level of readiness for sequencing and genomics, from laboratory expertise to computational and bioinformatics proficiency. Various funding agencies assess if sequencing is appropriate and is able to be sustained in a given country. Difficulties in building a genomics capability include cost of equipment, obtaining service contracts for instruments, obtaining kits and reagents in country, sustaining a trained workforce, and having the proper infrastructure.",
    "For low-income institutions, funds from sponsors help with the initial capacity building and then through collaborative research projects. Once partnerships are formed, cooperative engagement programs foster trust by encouraging participants to work together side-by-side to solve problems and challenges. Other trust-building activities include trainings, mentoring and advising in professional development, and developing personal relationships through in-person meetings.",
    "All of these activities increase the chances that a genomics capacity will be developed and used in biosurveillance. Collaborations among researchers and institutions can lead to the creation of research networks (Figure 1). These research networks are typically centered around a common pathogen, disease, or host of interest, such as a research network on bat-borne viruses or Rickettsial pathogens (9).",
    "Often called \"threat reduction research networks,\" they increase sustainability is key to creating and and maintain relationships. Trust sustaining networks, which allows for data sharing among collaborators within the network. Threat reduction research networks encourage collaborations on specific research projects, thereby creating new connections and maintaining those already established.",
    "The expertise of each institution can be leveraged; and therefore, they can provide support to each other throughout the duration of a funded research project. With increased travel and globalization, the world is more connected than the saying \"a threat ever, highlighting the importance of anywhere is a threat everywhere\" (6). Having threat reduction research networks in place with the trust that has been formed benefits the broader scientific community, such as in the early stages of an epidemic or pandemic through data sharing (Figure 1). Cooperative engagement programs support and promote the One Health initiative (Figure 1).",
    "One Health is the integrative and multidisciplinary approach to reducing disease risk by focusing on the health of people, animals, and the environment. A One Health approach to biosurveillance and threat reduction research networks is an important framework for understanding the whole ecology of disease systems, from wildlife reservoir hosts to the role of environmental conditions and habitat disturbances (10). We need to be able to reliably identify pathogens of importance in humans and domestic animals.",
    "Wildlife and changes in biodiversity need to be understood and addressed as well, which is an often-overlooked component of the global health security agenda (11, 12). The whole ecology of a disease system leads to a better understanding of the disease and provides information to enhance the effectiveness of biosurveillance efforts.",

    "Strengthening Sequencing Through Cooperative Engagement FIGURE 1 | Timeline of how cooperative engagement programs strengthen sequencing efforts in biosurveillance and promote trust in outbreak response. Before an outbreak occurs (pre-outbreak), cooperative engagement programs form relationships and build collaborations among institutions in various countries (green box).",
    "Research networks can be created, offering the ability to engage in collaborative research on a particular disease system. Strengthening sequencing capabilities allows countries to use sequencing and bioinformatics in a biosurveillance capacity (blue box). Cooperative engagement programs build trust, which benefits the wider scientific community after an outbreak (post-outbreak; purple box), such as sharing research and pathogen sequences.",
    "Having sequencing technology in place for biosurveillance allows for operational agility in the event of an outbreak; knowledge and resources can be co-opted for epidemic and pandemic response, such as providing data to infer transmission networks and create global phylogenies. researchers to target specific hosts and environments important to the pathogen in question (13).",
    "SEQUENCING IN BIOSURVEILLANCE Sequencing is an essential and critical tool in biosurveillance (14). In biosurveillance, early detection is crucial. Identifying pathogens in human, animal, and environmental samples cannot be completed without next generation sequencing.",
    "Sequencing is being introduced to and adopted by countries all over the world. Democratization of sequencing is a crucial aspect of threat reduction by making sure all countries can afford to adopt this technology and by making the process of sequencing and the analysis of genomic data more feasible (15). Next generation sequencing is still challenging to adopt because of the high learning curve associated with understanding the theory and techniques and gaining practical experience.",
    "In an effort to build sequencing capabilities in partner countries, trainings and workshops led by partner institutions include storage, collection, are needed to teach both \"wetlab\" techniques and bioinformatics. Wetlab topicsand sample preparation; DNA and/or RNA extraction; and performing in these wetlab a sequencing run. Along with trainings techniques, cooperative engagement programs promote training in applying bioinformatics tools to genomic data.",
    "Bioinformatics tools are essential to analyzing sequence data. Quality control, taxonomy identification tools (e.g., Kraken2, GOTTCHA2, MetaPhlAn2), phylogenetics, and reference-based analysis are all needed to identify and characterize pathogens in a particular sample and to get the most information out of genomic data as possible. Software such as Los Alamos National Laboratory's EDGE (Empowering the Development of Genomics Expertise) Bioinformatics platform (www.edgebioinformatics.org)are designed to make the analysis of genomic data relatively straightforward (16).",
    "An essential component of sequencing is the collection and inclusion of metadata. Metadata are the information that describe a given sample. Metadata are important throughout the entire life of a sample; from sample collection through sequencing Frontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org",
    "March 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 648424 Bartlow et al. Strengthening Sequencing Through Cooperative Engagement and bioinformatic analyses.",
    "When a sample is first collected, important metadata include, for example, time of collection, what kind of sample it is (e.g., throat swab, fecal sample, blood sample), where the sample was taken, from what host species it came, and location and environmental data (e.g., GPS coordinates and habitat type). Extraction methods, library preparation, and sequencing platform are also important to include as the sample is processed.",
    "Furthermore, recording bioinformatic analyses used to process data helps researchers use data that are deposited in public repositories. Integration of metadata with genomic data is key when adding it to a repository, especially linking raw data and processed data that may end up in different databases.",
    "These data are extremely important for research related to biosurveillance and sequencing pathogens during a pandemic, and help with contextualizing sequencing data and decision making. For example, without the proper metadata, conclusions regarding pathogen origin and evolution would not be possible. Metadata are especially vital for samples that are in long-term storage that may be processed at a later date.",
    "Applying sequencing and bioinformatics to biosurveillance and threat reduction research networks is key to understanding the whole ecology of disease systems in a One Health context. Knowledge of potential reservoir hosts and/or vectors, the circumstances of transmission events, and the effects of environmental conditions helps to reduce the risk of infectious disease threats and provides information to enhance biosurveillance efforts and effectiveness (17).",
    "For example, shotgun metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, and associated taxonomic ID tools, can be used to identify known and novel pathogens in human, animal, and environmental samples. By surveying the types of pathogens present in different regions, public health officials can be alerted about a potential threat and limit the severity and cost of an epidemic or pandemic (18) (Figure 1).",
    "Putting the sequencing systems in place and conducting trainings before an epidemic or pandemic occurs gives operational agility to respond to an outbreak and help with mitigation efforts (Figure 1). The technology and training need to be put in place prior to public health crises. Once in place, the technology can be co-opted to pandemic response; only the goals and questions being addressed change. Cooperative engagement programs begin establishing relationships and developing collaborations before an outbreak or a biological event occurs.",
    "Setting up sequencing machines and training local staff members how to go from sample to sequence to analysis is the first step. By investing time and effort into strengthening sequencing and bioinformatics capabilities through partnerships, trust is built, which can be leveraged both for biosurveillance (pre-outbreak) and outbreak response (post-outbreak; Figure 1). BENEFITS OF SEQUENCING THROUGHOUT A PANDEMIC A major tool in the fight against a pandemic is pathogen sequencing. Whereas, sequencing in a biosurveillance capacity deals with questions related to identifying and characterizing pathogens before outbreaks occur, sequencing throughout a pandemic provides real-time data on pathogen transmission and evolution (Figure 1).",
    "The trust gained from and promoted by cooperative engagement programs plays a major role in the sharing of sequence data among institutions and countries, as well as depositing sequences in public repositories (e.g., GISAID [https://www.gisaid.org]) (Figure 1). Having the technology and tools allows for operational agility; if the tools for biosurveillance are in place, it allows institutions to shift to pandemic response (Figure 1).",
    "In general, global sequencing efforts during an epidemic or pandemic can (1) identify unknown etiological agents, facilitating testing; (2) molecularly characterize pathogens such as inferring viral receptor usage; (3) track pathogen evolution throughout the duration of a pandemic; and 4) infer transmission networks by phylogenetic reconstruction. This information can be used to guide effective intervention strategies and track response efforts over time. is critical Early in pathogen emergence, quickly identifying the for developing diagnostic tools, etiological agent slowing transmission, guiding patient care, and designing therapeutics. For some agents, microbiological techniques such as microscopy and differential growth media can identify pathogens.",
    "These techniques likely lead to a broad understanding of the pathogen identity (i.e., bacterial genus, virus family). If genetic data are available for the pathogen group, PCR can be used to identify/confirm the pathogen identity.",
    "Using next-generation shotgun sequencing is a much faster and specific way to identify a pathogen requiring little a priori knowledge. Thus, sequencing patient samples with instruments like Oxford Nanopore's MinION or Illumina's MiSeq can identify pathogens, including those that are well-known, emerging, or completely novel, days earlier than conventional microbiological and sanger sequencing methods. For COVID-19, the pathogen genome was sequenced and compared to available sequences on public databases (19, 20).",
    "This revealed it was related to previously sequenced human pathogenic coronaviruses, such as the viruses that caused the 2003 SARS and 2012 MERS epidemics (21). However, it showed greater similarity to a coronavirus sequence obtained from bats (19). Interestingly, the spike protein, responsible for viral entry into cells, was more closely related to a separate published coronavirus sequence identified in pangolins (22).",
    "This paved the way for a more nuanced understanding of the evolutionary origins of the novel coronavirus responsible for the pandemic. Having a large amount of cataloged sequence data allowed for these conclusions to be made quickly, informing decision-making regarding mitigation efforts. The number of microorganisms in sequence databases is staggering, and the more broadly researchers sample, the more prepared the scientific community will be to respond to novel engagement emerging pathogens.",
    "Collaborative programs and threat reduction networks have the ability to generate sequencing data from understudied regions, closing a knowledge gap in sequence databases. Leveraging to understand a molecular current epidemic or pandemic pathogen is predicated on knowing its genome sequence. The genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 allowed the inference of host receptor usage.",
    "related pathogens studies of Frontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org March 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 648424 Bartlow et al.",
    "Strengthening Sequencing Through Cooperative Engagement especially Based on similarity to related coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1, it was likely the virus used the angiotensin- converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of human lung cells to gain entry (23, 24). This initial understanding, plus other homology- based insights, led to a list possible therapeutics (25), with current therapeutic options and promising candidates [reviewed in (26)].",
    "to be responding to human T-cell is responding to B-cell epitopes, With each additional country that participates in sequencing a pandemic pathogen, the power to identify loci contributing to adaptation to humans increases. Every transmission cluster that has sequences available is an independent evolution experiment.",
    "Variants emerging during a pandemic are of great concern because they can affect viral virulence, immunogenicity, and transmission, but also can impact diagnostic tests and vaccine effectiveness. For instance, 10,000 sequences deposited in GISAID (27) were used to assess that SARS-CoV-2 appears immune pressure,notbut indicating humoral selective pressure on the immunity imparts a significant virus (28). Genome sequences from all over the world being deposited in GISAID allowed Korber et al. (29) to show that the emergent variant leading to the amino acid change the coronavirus spike protein, which came to D614G of dominate SARS-CoV-2 sequences, is more transmissible. They went on to link clinical data to viral genome sequences and show that the increased transmissibility is likely due to increased viral shedding.",
    "Having many publicly available pathogen sequences can also help researchers predictthe robustness of diagnostic tools to pathogen evolution (30). All of these research directions are critical for a real-time, robust response to an ongoing pandemic, and are greatly strengthened by sequence contributions across all geographic regions, including those engaged in cooperative biological engagement programs. During a pandemic, one of the most vital contributions of collaborative sequencing efforts is to expand the number and geographic distribution of sequenced samples. Sequencing labs originally set up to address local outbreaks of endemic pathogens, can rapidly pivot to sequencing samples of a pandemic pathogen.",
    "For many countries, cross border movement of goods and workers is essential to the economy, individual livelihoods, and more importantly food distribution (31). Therefore, evidence- based decision making is critical.",
    "Identifying sources of new infections across country borders can be very difficult with tracking and tracing methods, especially where traditional infrastructure is limited. Thus, it is hard to know the efficacy of shutting down international travel for preventing pathogen spread. Phylogenetic analysis of sequences from an ongoing pandemic can identify if cases are from local transmission events or imported from other countries through human travel (32-34).",
    "These analyses are predicated on robust sequencing operations across regions including all countries with travel ties; the more sequencing across a region, the more everyone benefits. This makes collaborative efforts to stand up sequencing infrastructure an important component in decision making during an ongoing pandemic.",
    "DISCUSSION Emerging and re-emerging diseases will continue to spread to new areas and affect millions of people around the world. Even without including viruses with pandemic potential (e.g., coronaviruses and influenza viruses), zoonotic infectious diseases affect tens of millions of people per year and cause substantial economic and human health impacts (1, 4, 18, 35). These diseases often emerge with no warning, and as a result, health officials in charge of mitigation efforts begin at a disadvantage. In response to the threats of unforeseen pathogens, effective biosurveillance needs to be implemented.",
    "The goal of cooperative engagement programs is to increase the ability and capacity to detect and respond to infectious disease outbreaks, specifically those involving especially dangerous pathogens and pathogens of pandemic potential.the questions regarding infectious Sustaining collaborations together. through threat Cooperative engagement programs help to strengthen to answer both biosurveillance and research capabilities diseases. An important these programs is building trust important component of among institutions and countries by strengthening sequencing capabilitiesand capabilities reduction research networks and collaborative research projects further builds trust among researchers, institutions, and countries.",
    "This enables sample and data sharing, which is critical throughout the duration of an epidemic or pandemic. We urge the continued effort of cooperative engagement programs to strengthen sequencing capabilities for biosurveillance and research regarding emerging and re-emerging diseases. We need global unity in the fight against emerging diseases that pose significant risk to global health security, and cooperative engagement programs are leading the way.",

At the end of a natural experimental study of the health impacts of new transport infrastructure, we took the opportunity of a knowledge exchange forum to explore how stakeholders assessed, negotiated and intended to apply multisectoral evidence in policy and practice at the intersection of transport and health.",
    "We aimed to better understand the challenges they faced in knowledge exchange, as well as their everyday experiences with working in multisectoral remits. Methods: In 2015, we conducted participant observation during an interactive event with 41 stakeholders from national and local government, the third sector and academia in Cambridge, UK. Formal and informal interactions between stakeholders were recorded in observational field notes. We also conducted 18 semistructured interviews reflecting on the event and on knowledge exchange in general.",
    "Results: We found that stakeholders negotiated a variety of challenges. First, stakeholders had to negotiate relatively new formal and informal multisectoral remits; and how to reconcile the differing expectations of transport specialists, who tended to emphasise the importance of precedence in guiding action, and health specialists' concern for the rigour and synthesis of research evidence.",
    "Second, research in this field involved complex study designs, and often produced evidence with uncertain transferability to other settings. Third, health outcomes of transport schemes had political traction and were used strategically but not easily translated into cost-benefit ratios.",
    "Finally, knowledge exchange meant multiple directions of influence. Stakeholders were concerned that researchers did not always have skills to translate their findings into understandable evidence, and some stakeholders would welcome opportunities to influence research agendas. Conclusions: This case study of stakeholders' experiences indicates that multisectoral research, practice and policymaking requires the ability and capacity to locate, understand and communicate complex evidence from a variety of disciplines, and integrate different types of evidence into clear business cases beyond sectoral boundaries.

    "BMC Public Health (2017) 17:17 Page 2 of 11 Background Chronic noncommunicable diseases are the leading cause of mortality worldwide and a central public health challenge [1].",
    "For their prevention and control, a multi- sectoral \"whole-of-government\" or \"health in all policies\" approach is explicitly called for, for example as set out in the WHO Action Plan 2013-2020 [2], and should in- clude sectors beyond health such as education, employ- ment,to name a few. In England, public health was brought back from the National Health Service into local government in 2013 to facilitate cross-remit working, and policy documents such as Everybody Active, Every Day have made a case for addressing physical inactivity across society and in all domains [3].",
    "industry, environment and energy, finance, A second major current thrust in public health is that policymakers and practitioners are increasingly challenged to be guided by evidence based on research [4, 5].",
    "Health researchers, in turn, are tasked by funding bodies to dem- onstrate positive social and economic impact [6]. While \"health in all remits\" is still surprisingly under-researched, there is a large body of research within and outside the health field to investigate how evidence-based policy and practice might best be achieved.",
    "Over the years, concep- tualisations have moved from linear models of \"knowledge transfer\" to the more discursive notions of \"knowledge translation\" and \"knowledge exchange\" that assume a certain degree of dialogue and co-production of know- ledge [7, 8]. Academics have interrogated the understand- ings of individuals and institutions, and distinguished between data, information and evidence.",
    "\"Knowledge\" in knowledge exchange can be individual or collective, explicit or tacit, context-bound, socially shared, and value-laden [9]. However, what is known about knowledge exchange largely applies to indi- vidual knowledge (to inform clinical practice), and re- turned to understanding search has only collective, organisational processes [10]. It can borrow from research on the haphazard, chaotic and incidental nature, the \"social drama\"",
    "[11], of institutional decision- making [12, 13]. \"knowledge\" by disciplines, recently Despite all this research activity, there appears to be limited evidence for the effectiveness of \"evidence-based knowledge exchange\" and its underlying mechanisms, and little progress in effecting (or at least evaluating) successful knowledge exchange [10, 14].",
    "One possible explanation could be that many studies have shown little understanding of the \"realpolitik of 'getting evidence into practice'\" [9], and some academics argue that what is needed is to understand the context and complexity of evidence use in detail, as \"research is unlikely to provide context-independent evidence\" [10, 15].",
    "Multisectoral evidence - produced by a variety of disciplines with multiple methods and research designs - is discussed in similar ways. While there might be established ways of judging evidence for its rigour and strength within health and medicine, an increasingly outwardly looking field that embraces evidence from other sectors and dis- ciplines has a much more challenging task at hand. Nonetheless, it is urged to neither abandon the notion of evidence review and appraisal, nor dismiss solutions for which evidence is less easily appraised [16].",
    "On the contrary, public health strategies, which cut across sectors such as urban planning, agriculture and inter- national to grips with the type of evidence that is produced within these sectors, and with novel research methodologies such as natural experi- mental studies [17]. trade, must get This qualitative study explored knowledge exchange in the context of multisectoral public health, at the inter- section of health and transport [18].",
    "Encouraging \"active travel\" on foot or by bicycle by improving infrastructure such as cycle routes might be a \"best buy\" for increasing physical activity levels within populations [3]. We had the opportunity to investigate a natural experimental evaluation of new transport infrastructure and its poten- tial impact on active travel with a pool of stakeholders who work across both sectors. The aim of this qualita- tive case study was to understand how multisectoral evidence is assessed and negotiated by stakeholders at the intersection of the health and transport fields.",
    "We used the method of ethnography, which combines observations and interviewing to \"study social interac- tions, behaviours, and perceptions that occur within groups, teams, organisations, and communities\" [19]. Methods Study design and participants We used a case study design, aimed at exploring and capturing the complexity of a single case [20].",
    "Our case, the Commuting and Health in Cambridge study (hence- forth, the \"busway study\"), had investigated the magni- tude, nature and population distribution of changes in the travel behaviour, physical activity and related health indicators of commuters who travelled to work in Cambridge associated with the opening of a new guided busway system in 2011 [21]. The guided busway - simi- lar to a tramway - offered a new bus service on a segre- gated track along with a new off-road walking and cycle path.",
    "Data collection had finished in October 2012, pro- ducing over twenty scientific publications, using a variety of quantitative and qualitative, epidemiological and so- cial science research methods. In January 2015, the end of this multi-disciplinary, multi-method research project was marked by a stake- holder forum to present and discuss its findings, and this provided the opportunity to explore the process of knowledge exchange \"in practice\".",

    "The interactive event enabled us to record public discussions and knowledge exchange interactions be- tween researchers and their stakeholders, and in the in- terviews we could invite more in-depth reflections on this particular knowledge exchange event and people's experiences more generally. The stakeholder forum had been planned inde- this knowledge exchange case study. pendently of The format was intended to encourage dialogue, interaction and exchange in relation to the research findings, and associated research and practice topics and interests, between the study team and invited stakeholders.",
    "The forum began with an overview of the busway evaluation and its key findings. At- tendees then were able to circulate around a number of stands in an \"open day\" or \"market place\" format at which they could discuss relevant methods, find- ings and topics with members of the research team and other attendees.",
    "The forum closed with a plen- ary session to identify some key learning points from the forum and a commentary on their implications for policy and practice. The forum was attended by 41 researchers, practi- tioners and policymakers.",
    "They worked at the inter- section of transport, health and related areas such as sustainability or urban planning. Many had experience in several sectors and remits. Most were long term stakeholders of the research institution and received regular communications from it such as newsletters or invitations to events. Some were directly involved in the busway that had been evaluated.",
    "Seventeen stakeholders agreed to be interviewed in three pilot interviews and/or fifteen follow-up interviews. They belonged to a group of 21 directly contacted stake- holders who had expressed an interest during the forum or communication about it, and did not work too closely with the study team. They identified them- selves as researchers (n = 4), practitioners or policy- makers in national (n = 2) or local government (n = 9), (n = 2), and representatives working on cross-sector topics but identifying them- selves as based in the transport (9) or health (8) sec- tors.",
    "Two stakeholders were interviewed but could not attend the forum. The case study received ap- proval from the University of Cambridge Psychology Research Ethics Committee (Pre.2014.97). All partici- pants gave their informed consent, for the participant observation during the workshop by giving their consent online at the point of registration, and on separate consent forms prior to each interview.",
    "from the third sector Data collection During the forum we conducted participant observation to capture interactions, and used these as a starting point for reflections and eliciting contextual information in semistructured interviews with a subset of the at- tendees. For the participant observation, an experienced ethnographic researcher (CG) walked between the market place stands, observed the panel discussion and engaged in conversations in breaks and during lunch.",
    "She paid particular attention to discussions about the relevance and usefulness of evidence; to expressed inter- ests in or preference for different types of evidence; and to informal conversations between stakeholders, and between stakeholders and the study team, about any concerns, applications and adaptations relating to the use of evidence in their specific contexts. The participant observation of the event was known to the attendees at the outset, and the researcher was introduced at the beginning of the event; the researcher followed up on some interactions or discussions in direct conversations with particular stakeholders.",
    "Observations and conversa- tions were recorded in ethnographic field notes. Nine busway study team members and forum facilitators (including two experienced ethnographers) also wrote short reflective summary field notes, in particular about \"stand-out\" interactions, queries or contributions they experienced during the event.",
    "The participant observa- tion served as a preliminary data collection phase to inform the guide for and analysis of the semistructured interviews. Several months before the forum, we conducted three semistructured pilot interviews in preparation for the interview guide.",
    "As the event and to pilot the initial participant observations of a one-off forum could cap- ture only partial insights, we used the follow-up inter- views to investigate any emerging issues in greater depth in a one-to-one setting, and explored these within the particular context and experience of each interviewee. The forum format and discussions during the forum served as a prompt at the start of each interview (see interview guide in Additional file 1).",
    "We asked about stakeholders' assessment of the evidence presented to them, and explored their experience of using evidence and encountering resistance to this, for example regard- ing particular types of evidence and methods of commu- nication. The interviews were scheduled shortly after the forum to give the participants some time to reflect on possible plans for using the evidence.",
    "Ten of the follow- up interviews were conducted within 1 to 4 weeks after the forum, and another five within the next 4 weeks. The interviews lasted about 30 min and were mostly conducted by phone, or sometimes in person (at either the participant's workplace or the research institution) according to the convenience of each participant.",

    "We retained some flexibility for inductive analysis of emerging unanticipated issues. The field notes were analysed immediately after the stakeholder forum to inform the guide for the follow-up interviews.",
    "The transcripts were analysed to build on the initial coding and emerging themes. CG led the analysis and did most of the coding; DO independently coded three sample transcripts to challenge, complement or confirm analytical interpretations. Constant comparison between themes that emerged from coding, and between the multiple sources of field notes and the interview transcripts, also helped to triangulate our findings.",

    "Results Negotiating sector-specific evidence in new multisectoral roles The roles and remits of many of our study participants were multisectoral, either by definition (being assigned to a different sector or tasked to work across sectors) or by dedication (having interests that spanned sectors). Participants were either public health researchers, practi- tioners or policymakers who integrated travel and transport into health cases; or transport researchers, practitioners or policymakers who considered the inte- gration of health benefits into the business cases or planning of transport schemes.",
    "As explained earlier, such multisectoral roles had recently been formalised and institutionalised as the government had (re-)integrated the public health function from the National Health Service to local government in England. However, partic- ipants from public health backgrounds, who found themselves embedded in this way into existing structures of local politics and policymaking, explained that even within this new policy environment of shared priorities, individual effort was still required to breach working in silos. And existing roles in other sectors required a new (and less formal) openness to allowing health into their remit.",
    "Even shared interests required to be allocated to spe- cific budgets; designated \"shared priorities budgets\" were considered very limited. Public health policymakers ex- plained that in the absence of shared budgets, a \"health benefit\" business case was often too readily considered a clear responsibility for the health budget. At the same time, they saw a danger in considering health as a pure \"add-on\" to other priorities and benefits such as eco- nomic growth, because \"add-ons\" were vulnerable in a time of financial austerity and budget cuts. \"Because ideally what you want is the person in transport to actually have enough appreciation of public health that that gets borne in mind in the interventions they put in, whereas it's almost a bit of an add-on.",
    "[...] And [...] the add-ons are always the first things to be cut when budgets are squeezed...\" (SE12; research, health)",
    "During the forum, a heated debate focused on the challenge that sharing priorities and budgets also meant co-developing business cases, despite \"the use of different language\" in health and transport. This was not so much about sector-specific language - all were familiar with the terminology surrounding active travel, for example - but about different expectations of what was considered relevant evidence. Participants described this as a \"culture shock\" that inexperienced public health trainees, in particular, might experience when entering the world of local policymaking.",
    "The consensus was that health colleagues were very used to the notion of evidence synthesis and the status accorded to evidence from randomised controlled tri- als (RCTs), guided by the notion of an \"evidence hier- archy\". In contrast, transport colleagues were more interested in precedence - whether something had been done before and \"worked\" elsewhere.",
    "\"...this is a bit of a generalisation here, but in general public health people would love to see [...] an effectiveness study with a low p value and a good return on investment, and a high impact, [...] but transport people would like to hear a good story and know that it's [...] working\". (SE02; research, health)",
    "While this divergence between evidence synthesis and precedence was largely explained by different disciplinary and training backgrounds, the potential tension between \"hard facts\" and \"good examples\" was often reconciled in practice. To make a convincing argument when addressing and lobbying politicians and decision-makers, a third translational effort was described, connecting personalised examples with snappy cost-benefit statistics. While business cases would benefit from convincing statistics demonstrat- ing effectiveness, if a scheme \"worked\" or \"paid off\" across sectors, participants felt that elected members liked to see such numbers translated into a relatable illustration.",

    "Page 5 of 11 \"[...] there's a need for key headline quantitative stuff, so like charging for parking we reduced car use by 20% which in turn increased active travel by 60%, [...] which is all great [...]. But at the same time we need those stories as well because they come to be the ones that people really listen to and can relate to, and certainly in the political environment that we're working in, the members would much rather hear 'Barry from Fakenham [...] said [...] he's now walking five times a week and he would never have done this unless they started charging for parking'\".",
    "(SE03; local government, health) Negotiating complex evidence derived from novel research designs Participants' descriptions of priorities and preferences, which related to evidence synthesis and precedence, did not, however, map onto neat juxtapositions in their experience with research evidence. Evidence in this field is often derived from evaluating complex population this health interventions [17].",
    "entailed evaluating the effects of infrastructural changes that had the potential to encourage active travel. Struc- tural changes of this kind affect and are shaped by both the physical (built) and social environment, and are therefore inherently contextual and complex.",
    "Reflecting on the study findings presented during the stakeholder forum, participants described the different aspects of assessing this kind of evidence and their efforts to nego- tiate challenging research findings. In the busway study, Participants were very aware that the evidence pro- duced in this particular study was inherently tied to its setting, Cambridge. In this university city, cycling is rela- tively common across all ages and backgrounds and compared to the rest of the country [25], and the new guided busway is a relatively rare form of transport infrastructure around the world. Despite a general favouring of precedence, participants from the transport sector infrastructural changes were closely shaped by the local context in which they were implemented and would not necessarily work elsewhere.",
    "in particular were aware that \"...one calculation I want somebody to make is how much of the new development around the city would be able to take place in another city where there isn't a strong cycling culture [...].",
    "So you know much of the development in, as I say, that's able to take place around Cambridge, in another city possibly wouldn't be able to because they wouldn't be viable in transport terms...\" (SE08; local authority, transport) Closely related to this challenge of generalisability, participants also understood that evidence was rarely aiming large-scale to evaluate clear-cut when derived from natural experimental studies structural changes, the outcomes of which are difficult to meas- ure, let alone predict. Transport specialists were per- haps more at ease with ambiguous evidence, as they were less experienced with working with clear-cut evidence from RCTs, as described above.",
    "However, those working in the health field were not necessarily better equipped to critically appraise the quality and strength of evidence that was not produced through RCTs. During the forum discussion as much as during the interviews, there were calls for knowledge exchange to include translation of how the evidence was produced, not merely what it meant. Participants said that col- leagues often lacked the necessary skills to assess evi- dence and how it was produced; or to understand how evidence about other interesting and relevant issues, such as the monetary value of particular interventions, might be difficult to produce.",
    "\"... if you take an RCT about an intervention clearly it's incredibly important and is very, very clear, but most research is not 100% or anywhere near that to be honest\". (SE12; national, health)",
    "\"The difficulty is as soon as people have to [...] critically appraise things themselves for what's in it for them you're going to lose a lot of people because they don't have the skills or the time or the inclination to do it\". (SE11; research, health)",
    "A case for this was the presentation of evidence from the busway study about the potential effect of charging for car parking on promoting the integration of more active travel into people's commuting journeys. Under- standing of the evidence that was presented was variable, but it was received overwhelmingly positively by the participants as clear-cut evidence showing unambiguous evidence that parking fees could effectively deter people from commuting by car.",
    "This sparked much debate about the seductive simplicity, but also the political con- tentiousness, of seeking to influence behaviour in this way. The heated discussion and subsequent interview responses included references to the need for action if presented with such convincing and (technically) easily- implemented evidence, but also warnings that any such scheme could easily be derailed if it were seen to oppose the political or economic mainstream that worried more about the acceptability of the measures to the electorate. From a research perspective, however, the challenge was different.",
    "The researchers who presented the findings on parking charges considered the evidence to be relatively weak. The observational epidemiological research design Guell et al. BMC Public Health (2017) 17:17 Page 6 of 11 had indicated only evidence of associations, and there- fore of the potential to influence commuting behaviour through parking charges that warranted further inter- vention studies to establish a causal relationship - a nuance of research design that seemed less apparent, or less important, to many participants from policy and practice.",
    "Negotiating partial and strategic evidence While the transferability of research findings was a con- cern, that decision- making in policy and practice was routinely based on such partial, incomplete evidence. some participants pointed out \"...policymakers make decisions on the basis of incomplete evidence because if you waited for complete evidence you'd never make a decision; so there's this trade-off [...]. So it would be good if the debate wasn't centred on sufficiency of evidence where [...] policymakers say 'does it work or doesn't it work?' and the researcher [...] saying 'well, it's not as simple as that' because then it's a dead debate because it doesn't take us anywhere\".",
    "(SE04; third sector, transport) Participants from all sectors discussed this challenge of \"not knowing enough\" as a common, manageable experience for decision-makers but also as a weakness for lobbying them convincingly.",
    "From a research per- spective, this was debated in terms of a shift from \"evi- dence-based\" to \"evidence-informed\" practice in public health. This was echoed by suggestions that while practi- tioners and policymakers might be quite experienced and familiar with the notion of \"evidence-informed\" practice, researchers might need to be more confident in conveying the \"best available\" evidence rather than that highlighting remaining scientific uncertainties might delay action. \"I've started using 'evidence-informed' recently.",
    "[...] you want the scientific evidence but then you've also got other sorts of evidence that politicians or policymakers [...] will take into account [...], and also not all evidence agrees with each other, you do ten studies, they don't come out with a nice clear answer, [...] and actually that doesn't really matter because what you need then is someone with the judgement to pull those together, use that to inform their decision\".",
    "(SE12; research, health) Participants also described their efforts to use evidence strategically. Their comments in both the open forum discussion and individual interviews described a tension when making a case for \"health\" as a strategic and convincing piece of an argument.",
    "Epidemiological evi- dence for the health benefits of physical activity had political traction, but concrete evidence for the effects of particular interventions - that infrastructure A leads to health outcome B - was hard to come by. \"I always try to say that health",
    "[...] is a very strong lever to use when we want to talk about active travel. So if I can supply the data that says, if so many more people could cycle or walk, then we'd have so many fewer heart attacks, which means so many fewer admissions, or so many fewer sick leave days, or something. That's very powerful\".",
    "(SE05; local government, health) On the one hand, a health argument was considered to carry weight when addressing decision-makers, and epidemiological evidence could even be used as proxy cost-benefit evidence because a healthier population or workforce would surely mean lower healthcare costs or more productivity.",
    "On the other hand, policymakers and practitioners expressed their frustration that a clear monetary value could often not be attached to a specific intervention - in particular, not to the infrastructural case study at hand - and that this could weaken the argument. Public health was often seen as a \"long game\", involving health outcomes that might range from the prevention of chronic disease and early death to more immediate but less quantifiable outcomes such as re- duced absenteeism or better mental wellbeing.",
    "While they understood that a complex infrastructural change might result in health co-benefits that took a long time to emerge and were difficult to measure or convert to a monetary value, some regretted the lack of an explicit health economics element in the busway study. \"...monetising the costs to the healthcare sector of other policies, so if we make this change to the transport system it will benefits their healthcare system to the tune of X million Pounds is something that some people are really uncomfortable with doing because obviously it's quite a flawed and simplistic thing to do, but unfortunately if you want to change decision makers' minds you do need to put it in a way that they understand [...]\".",
    "(SE06; local government, health) Negotiating the production of multisectoral evidence Finally, participants were all not only receivers of know- ledge exchange exercises but - true to the notion of \"exchange\" - producers of such efforts. Many of our participants not only operated at the intersection of dif- ferent sectors, and often disciplines, but also had experi- ence in research, practice and/or policymaking, having Guell et al.",
    "BMC Public Health (2017) 17:17 Page 7 of 11 moved between different professional roles in the course of their careers.",
    "Understandings about the direction of influence were echoed by many, but also contested. Others cautioned that evidence produced by research organisations would need to be seen as independent; otherwise it would lose its power, authority and impact. Most participants agreed that it was very import- ant that research spoke effectively and relevantly to issues in policy and practice. However, they recog- nised that not all researchers might be interested in communicating their research, and that not all pol- icymakers resources, and practitioners had the capability or political will to base their advice and actions on scientific evidence.",
    "Knowledge brokers and generalists could help bridge this gap, and some participants attempted to fulfil this role themselves, based on their work across remits. \"So the difficulty is both sides, it's not just policymakers ignoring evidence or not understanding evidence, it's researchers translating evidence into usable decision, actionable things\".",
    "(SE04; third sector, transport) \"I work a lot supervising public health registrars and they have to do a lot of work to simplify their message down to a level where it will actually be engaging and compelling and easy to understand, and I have to do a lot of work with them to keep rewriting the same thing over and over until they get it simple enough that someone [understands] who was in a hurry\". (SE06; local government, health)",
    "The other direction of knowledge exchange, heatedly debated both in front of colleagues and anonymously during interviews, was the direction from policy and practice to research. Some suggested that for research to achieve impact, perhaps the policy and practice sectors should have more influence on setting research agendas. Some participants would have liked to see researchers involving policymakers and practitioners from the start of planning new research projects, and that this required effort from both sides and openness to share ideas and plans with each other.",
    "\"We've got practice going along, we've got research saying this is better, but [...] they're just not coming together. [...] I mean, research as well [...] needs to know what's coming up, so that they can start working towards it, needs to know what local priorities are. [...]",
    "But it's difficult [...], I've asked for forewarning of potential projects [...] and I just get diverted to a website that is publicly available. That's not helpful.",
    "[...] People are very scared of sharing and exchanging knowledge, and I think it's detrimental in the long term\". (SE06; local government, health)",
    "\"I'm not sure that I think, you know, practitioners should be directing the agenda of academia. That would concern me a bit I think, you know. I think academia should be a very much an independent force...\" (SE14; research, transport)",
    "This question of the level of involvement in research, and whether there might be a limit to such involvement, seemed to depend on the topic matter and context, and was perhaps most importantly felt in regard to politically charged and highly polarised topics. The importance of assumed \"stakes\" was raised in relation to contentious schemes such as car parking charges, but some partici- pants felt that any infrastructural \"anti- or non-car\" scheme would be better supported by independent aca- demic evidence than by third sector advocacy.",
    "Others pointed out that evidence was never neutral, and re- search was certainly not ideology-free. \"[...] ideology informing the research that's done and [...] it always has and always will. I think the best that we can do is be open about it and clear about the drivers behind it and understand that this is going to govern the research questions that we ask [...]. So I don't subscribe to the idea that there's, you know, we're building an objective body of knowledge and evidence which policymakers should adopt...\" (SE04; third sector, transport)",
    "Discussion Summary of findings In this ethnographic case study, participants had experi- enced knowledge exchange in their daily practice as a variety of challenges, tensions and negotiations. Their new roles in the multisectoral field of transport and health varied in formality and priorities which had to be negotiated within and between sectors.",
    "Language and expectations of the type of evidence differed and created similar challenges. The most pronounced difference was that between what was described as a preference for precedence by transport specialists, and for systematic evidence synthesis by public health specialists.",
    "However, evidence was complex, sometimes conflicting and often incomplete. Complex research designs produced partial evidence, but partici- pants suggested that decision-makers were used to mak- ing decisions despite such uncertainties. That said, evidence strength could be rated in different ways, sometimes shaped by the ability to \"read\" evidence cor- rectly, and even seemingly clear-cut evidence could be experienced as contextual, Guell et al.",
    "BMC Public Health (2017) 17:17 Page 8 of 11 politically contentious. In addition, the potential health co-benefits of transport schemes were appreciated to have traction in arguments made to decision-makers, but were not necessarily easily investigated by re- searchers or translated into convincing cost-benefit ana- lyses.",
    "Finally, knowledge exchange happened within a context of multiple directions of influence and expecta- tions thereof. Participants discussed that researchers needed the skills to make their evidence understandable, and that some might not be interested or well suited to undertake this task themselves. Instead, knowledge bro- kers might be better placed to do such translational work.",
    "Finally, policymakers and practitioners considered the benefits, but also the potential disbenefits, of influ- encing research agendas more directly. Results in context The findings echo much of the knowledge exchange lit- erature, such as the necessity of translating knowledge into different sectoral and disciplinary languages and having the time and skills to do so [8, 15, 26, 27], appre- ciating different types of knowledge or a combination thereof as useful, convincing or strong [28-30], and the ways in which evidence can be used strategically to serve particular outcomes [13, 30]. While it might not be a particularly new insight that different sectors inhabit different epistemological worlds and appraise knowledge differently, the experience of practitioners and policy- makers whose remit spans several sectors has rarely been captured. Two further issues are selected here as particularly pertinent to this specific context: the role of uncertain evidence in knowledge exchange, and the political nature of evidence.",
    "This case study of evidence derived from a natural experimental evaluation represents the challenges of much public health research. Interventions of this kind outside the health sector can create a natural opportun- ity to produce new learning about how best to produce beneficial outcomes across the health and transport sectors. However, evaluating the impact of complex in- terplays of social, environmental and political-economic contexts on population health behaviour produces com- plex evidence that can rarely be distilled into simple, definite answers",
    "[17]. Rather it forms a jigsaw of partial evidence derived from a range of methods, that might gradually be built up across multiple studies over time to form an emerging, more generalisable picture [28]. Researchers who produce this evidence can accept such uncertainty in their daily practice, relying on tools such as confidence intervals and sensitivity analyses to commu- nicate levels of uncertainty, and suggesting further re- search and refinement of scientific concepts and methods.",
    "Practitioners and policymakers, however, face the dilemma of being tasked to put such partial evidence, and from sectors they might be less familiar with, into comprehen- sive action, eradicating uncertainty from business cases and policy documents in the process. Lipsky's seminal work on \"street level bureaucracy\" was one of the first that aimed to understand individuals' efforts to implement organisational decision-making with its inherent uncertainties",
    "[31]. He found that front- line public service workers had to negotiate multiple, interacting factors such as regulations, policy directives and expectations of elected officials which were not ne- cessarily aligned.",
    "This resulted in discretions and incon- sistencies in putting policy into practice. More recent work on evidence based policymaking has explored ethnographically how civil servants need to craft \"per- suasive policy stories\" from a large but inconclusive amount of evidence [32].",
    "Similarly, a study on health policy has traced how varying evidence - in this case on screening for a range of cancers - and its context re- sulted in different appraisals and use of evidence, and different policy recommendations, by different expert groups [33].",
    "Part of the uncertainty is that evidence is not always understandable and may be produced through methods that are novel, specialised or complex. Studies from the field of environmental public policy, for example, have described how practitioners and policymakers have to grapple with new research technologies such as model- ling, and those skilled to read this evidence are better placed to influence policy outcomes [34].",
    "In our study, researchers, practitioners and policymakers described that they needed to understand a range of evidence produced from multiple methods and disciplines, and negotiate what constituted relevant, reliable or relatable evidence across sectors. This varied, complex and challen- ging evidence formed part of their everyday practice - echoing research that suggests that evidence jigsaws can be helpful in making a policy case [28] - but also hindered their ability to influence decision-makers with clear advice. It has been suggested that perhaps what policymakers need is not more evidence, but more systematic \"methods for identifying, interpreting, and applying evidence in dif- ferent decision-making contexts\"",
    "[33]. Also, complex population health research does not produce evidence to influence individual clinical deci- sions, but aims to effect population-level responses in policy and practice and is therefore more exposed to political and public scrutiny [35].",
    "This is particularly pronounced in the \"more overtly politicised local gov- ernment space\" into which public health has recently moved in England [30]. Importantly, it is not just actors and spaces that are political; evidence is itself far from neutral and can be positioned in varied ways in policy and practice, thereby adding to uncertainties surround- ing evidence.",
    "Tension between the assumed objectivity Guell et al. BMC Public Health (2017) 17:17",
    "Page 9 of 11 of research and subjectivity of politics arise if decision- makers want the evidence to confirm that the chosen outcome from a decision is correct, or conversely if the evidence points to politically or socially contentious ac- tions. Our participants, for example, explained that in- frastructural schemes were highly politicised and that in the current climate of financial austerity in the public sector, any business cases were increasingly reduced to an economic bottom line. It has been suggested that evi- dence in policy should be considered as \"socially embed- ded in authority relations\"",
    "[36], and that politics is not a third pillar besides research and policy but runs through all domains [30].",
    "While much of the knowledge exchange literature has focused on the practice or policy side, it is equally im- portant to note that evidence production - research - is also not free of ideology and politics [11].",
    "Some of our participants felt strongly that research should be guided by policy agendas, and that research and practice should be developed simultaneously and iteratively for more policy-relevant evidence, better informed practice, and timely evaluation. Others were concerned that research ought to retain its public image of neutrality, and thus retain its authority or power to influence policy agendas. This sentiment, of course, also pointed to the political nature of research. Implications for practice and future research More research about the uncertain and political nature of evidence is clearly still needed as these play out in dif- ferent public health contexts in research, policy and practice.",
    "While this case study particularly focused on the context of active travel and transport as a target of population health intervention, it indicates that through the lens of a particular context of transport and health, larger barriers to knowledge exchange in multisectoral, evidence-based public health can be identified [35, 37].",
    "Most public health remits span sectors, fields, remits and disciplines, whether by interest or institutionalised [38]. We need to learn more about the realpolitik and contextual factors of multisectoral collaboration [39], which are meant to underpin current public health pol- icymaking, for example the ways in which partnerships between health, agriculture and national and global in- dustry might or might not work to ensure the accessibil- ity and affordability of healthy foods",
    "[40]. Such analysisof institutional knowledge processes could help to understand how multisectoral working can be successful, for example how to achieve integration of priorities and partners in multisectoral collaboration",
    "[38]. Moreover, multisectoral partnerships can be just as polarising and politicised as evidence, and this can affect how evidence can be used and abused strategically. In-depth policy analyses could, in fact, focus on a range of public health strategies such as the taxation of sugar sweetened bever- ages and other unhealthy foods [41], understanding the broader perspective of that hold influence and authority over decision making as well as micro- or \"street-level\" negotiation.",
    "This could inform strategies for engaging effectively with industry oppos- ition and political and public scepticism. \"actor networks\" Strengths and limitations We believe the strength of the research design was its case study approach; using a \"real life\" example of know- ledge exchange attached to a particular research project enabled us to understand the contextual factors that shaped, supported and hindered the use of evidence by our stakeholders",
    "[32, 42]. Exploring a particular, poign- ant context helped to focus our debate with them and encourage reflection. The case also helped to highlight particular topics, such as polarising evidence and evi- dence from complex research designs.",
    "Moreover, using an ethnographic method that combined participant ob- strengthened our analysis servation with interviews through the triangulation of themes and discussion. We were able to record formal and informal exchanges be- tween stakeholders and between \"them\" and \"us\", and in follow-up interviews we could allow space for reflection on the evidence presented and on opportunities to make use of it in their daily practice. Reflecting with our stake- holders during the event and subsequent interviews, and with some of them during the analysis, we could develop \"policy points\" with them to summarise insights from this study (see Additional file 2).",
    "Our research design also had limitations. We did not include much of a researcher perspective in this case study, and mostly interviewed stakeholders in policy and practice roles. This was mainly because most of the re- searchers who attended the forum were attached to the busway study, and were asked to write field notes for this case study. However, some of our participants from policy and practice had experiences as researchers them- selves and included reflections from a research perspec- tive.",
    "National government representation was also limited at the forum, and therefore in this study. This may have reflected the limited availability of civil ser- vants shortly before a general election in particular, or for knowledge exchange events more generally.",
    "This study therefore included a self-selected pool of partici- pants with a particular interest in the multisectoral sub- ject matter and perhaps in evidence-based practice and policy and knowledge exchange more generally. Simi- larly, this may have limited the responses in the inter- views, as those agreeing to be interviewed may have been particularly interested in the topic. While qualita- tive purposive samples aim for knowledgeable, \"informa- tion-rich\" participants [22], discussions and interviews",
    "Guell et al. BMC Public Health (2017) 17:17 Page 10 of 11 with less informed practitioners and policymakers in the field may have yielded different or additional insights.",
    "Finally, elected representatives and members ofthe general public were not represented at the forum or in this case study, and this was highlighted as part of crit- ical feedback from participants. It was also suggested that for future events the organisers could encourage in- vitees to \"bring a friend\", or indeed to \"bring an enemy\", to broaden the range of perspectives reflected in discus- sion and the interviews.",
    "Conclusion Studies of multisectoral population health interventions, such as those aiming to encourage physical activity by changing the built environment, produce complex evi- dence and aim to inform practitioners and policymakers across a variety of sectors. Knowledge exchange in multi- sectoral public health requires people who can locate and interpret evidence from a variety of disciplines, and can find a common language to integrate such evidence clearly into business cases. Practitioners and policymakers would welcome help from researchers to translate complex, chal- lenging and often incomplete evidence into clear recom- mendations, and clearer mandates from politicians for health as a priority in all remits. These would strengthen their efforts to integrate health benefits in business cases and promote multisectoral cooperation. Additional files Additional file 1: Interview Guide.",

Recovery Colleges are opening internationally.",
    "The evaluation focus has been on out- comes for Recovery College students who use mental health services. However, benefits may also arise for: staff who attend or co-deliver courses; the mental health and social care service hosting the Recovery College; and wider society.",
    "A theory-based change model characterising how Recovery Colleges impact at these higher levels is needed for formal evaluation of their impact, and to inform future Recovery College development. The aim of this study was to develop a stratified theory identifying candidate mechanisms of action and outcomes (impact) for Recovery Colleges at staff, services and societal levels.",
    "Methods. Inductive thematic analysis of 44 publications identified in a systematised review was supplemented by collaborative analysis involving a lived experience advisory panel to develop a preliminary theoretical framework.",
    "This was refined through semi-structured inter- views with 33 Recovery College stakeholders (service user students, peer/non-peer trainers, managers, community partners, clinicians) in three sites in England. Results. Candidate mechanisms of action and outcomes were identified at staff, services and societal levels.",
    "At the staff level, experiencing new relationships may change attitudes and associated professional practice. Identified outcomes for staff included: experiencing and valuing co-production; changed perceptions of service users; and increased passion and job motivation.",
    "At the services level, Recovery Colleges often develop somewhat separately from their host system, reducing the reach of the college into the host organisation but allow- ing development of an alternative culture giving experiential learning opportunities to staff around co-production and the role of a peer workforce. At the societal level, partnering with community-based agencies gave other members of the public opportunities for learning alongside people with mental health problems and enabled community agencies to work with people they might not have otherwise. Recovery Colleges also gave opportunities to benefi- cially impact on community attitudes.",
    "Conclusions. This study is the first to characterise the mechanisms of action and impact of Recovery Colleges on mental health staff, mental health and social care services, and wider society. The findings suggest that a certain distance is needed in the relationship between the Recovery College and its host organisation if a genuine cultural alternative is to be created. Different strategies are needed depending on what level of impact is intended, and this study can inform decision-making about mechanisms to prioritise.",
    "Future research into Recovery Colleges should include contextual evaluation of these higher level impacts, and investigate effectiveness and harms. (c) Cambridge University Press 2018 Introduction Recovery Colleges are a global innovation in mental health systems.",
    "The concept of 'recovery education' - supporting recovery in relation to mental health problems through education - was developed in Boston and Phoenix in the 1990s. In the past decade, a model of Recovery Colleges has emerged, with greater emphasis on co-production and co-learning.",
    "The first Recovery College opened in England in 2009, and there are now over 80 in the UK (Anfossi, 2017). This model has spread internationally, with Recovery Colleges now open or planned in 22 countries, e.g. Australian, Bulgaria, Canada, Hong Kong, Ireland, A. Crowther et al.",
    "Italy, Japan, among others (Perkins et al., 2018). the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Uganda, Recovery Colleges involve supporting people living with mental health problems through adult education rather than through treat- ment (Perkins et al., 2012). The skills needed for living well with mental illness are relevant to anyone, so health professionals, family members and the public as well as service users attend colleges as students. Proportions vary, but, e.g. in the first Italian Recovery College, the student proportions were 63% service users, 19% fam- ily, 7% staff and 11% community members (Lucchi et al., 2018).",
    "After registration, students attend self-selected courses co-delivered by peer trainers (people with personal experience of mental ill- health and recovery) and non-peer trainers (e.g. clinicians or topic experts). Recovery Colleges typically directly employ a small team of peer and mental health practitioners, with a larger group of peer trainers and practitioner trainers from mental health ser-",
    "vices and community agencies who are used on a sessional basis. Courses offered may cover understanding different mental health issues and treatment options, rebuilding life with mental health challenges, developing life skills and confidence to either rebuild life outside services or get the most out of services, capacity building and developing the peer workforce, and helping people to provide support for family members and friends who experience mental health challenges.",
    "Courses vary from brief, 1 h, introductory ses- sions to a day per week for a term (10 weeks) (Perkins et al., 2018). A key feature of Recovery Colleges is the emphasis on co-production, i.e. people with lived experience co-produce all aspects of the college including curriculum development, quality assurance and delivering courses alongside a trainer with profes- sional or topic-specific expertise. The impact of Recovery Colleges can be stratified into four levels of social reality (Wikgren, 2005): student, staff, services and societal. The impact on students has been the primary motiv- ation for developing Recovery Colleges, and in separate papers we published a fidelity measure (Toney et al., 2018a) and a co-pro- duced model of mechanisms of action and outcomes for students (Toney et al., 2018b). Our focus in this study is on the other three levels.",
    "The staff level comprises Recovery College staff such as managers, administrators and trainers (including peer and non- peer trainers), and health professionals who attend courses. The services level comprises the mental health and social care system with which the Recovery College is usually, though not always, is the wider family, community connected. The societal and social environment in which citizenship is enacted and stigma potentially experienced.",
    "level Publications about Recovery Colleges make claims for benefits at each level, but the scientific evidence base for Recovery Colleges is developing. Evaluations of experiences and outcomes at the stu- dent level have been the main focus, as they are the priority bene- ficiary group for Recovery Colleges.",
    "Research designs primarily comprise uncontrolled cohort studies, case series with pre- and post-test outcome assessment, and expert opinion (Australian Healthcare Associates, 2018). For example, a study of psychia- trists' views about the impact of Recovery Colleges on students showed general support, with the main concerns being about the relationship with the clinical system and attitudes to medica- tion adherence (Collins et al., 2018).",
    "Although the overall weight of preliminary evidence is strongly positive (Meddings et al., 2015b; Slade et al., 2017; Australian Healthcare Associates, 2018), no randomised controlled trials have been conducted. use experimental methodologies.",
    "For example, a survey of 94 i.e. mental health workers attending Recovery staff students, Colleges as students, found 93% would recommend attendance to colleagues, with 54% self-identifying attitudinal change, 63% a positive impact on personal wellbeing and 88% benefits for practice (Perkins et al., 2017). Staff identify benefits from learning about the expertise of lived experience (Sommer et al., 2018) and increasing their hopefulness about recovery (Newman-Taylor et al., 2016), resulting in a positive impact on practice (Perkins et al., 2018). For trainers, self-identified benefits include improved self-esteem and professional growth (Gill, 2014), and being inspired and transformed (Perkins et al., 2018). Staff also self- report benefits in relation to morale, job satisfaction and reduced job-related stress (Sommer et al., 2018).",
    "At the level of services, the need for mental health system transformation in order to fully support recovery has been iden- tified globally (World Health Organization, 2013; United Nations General Assembly, 2017). Recovery Colleges are proposed as a vehicle supporting this transformation towards recovery-oriented practice and co-production (Perkins et al., 2018). The evidence base for service-level impact is very limited, although there is a modest evidence of attitudinal shift in staff who are more involved in Recovery Colleges compared with those who are not (Rinaldi and Suleman, 2012), and staff identify positive impacts on organ- isational culture, e.g. in greater use of strength-based approaches (Sommer et al., 2018) and more awareness of in-system stigma (McGregor et al., 2016).",
    "Cost savings have been suggested (Slade et al., 2017), including reduced hospital use (Bourne et al., 2017) and staff sickness (Shepherd and McGregor, 2016). No evaluative research has been published at the societal level.",
    "Candidate pathways of action include course attendance by family members and by non-mental health stakeholders, involvement of community organisations in co-delivering courses, governance arrangements (e.g. some Recovery Colleges are administered by further or higher education colleges or by community organisa- tions), contributing to public mental health awareness (North Essex Research Network, 2014) and addressing community stigma (McGregor et al., 2016). Existing evaluations of Recovery Colleges do not specify or evaluate the causal mechanisms through which they are expected to operate.",
    "This creates challenges for implementation, fidelity and cross-cultural modification. The development of a theory- based change model specifying causal connections between mechanisms of action and outcomes in the related area of peer worker interventions (Gillard et al., 2015) has substantially advanced peer worker-related research.",
    "The aim of this study was to develop a stratified theory identifying mechanisms of action and outcomes for Recovery Colleges at each of the staff, services and societal levels. Methods The research reported here was part of the Recovery Colleges Characterisation and Testing (RECOLLECT) Study (researchin- torecovery.com/recollect).",

    "Inductive thematic analysis on key papers was conducted by one coder, and then refined through discussion with the research team (n = 5) including expert qualitative researchers. To ensure lived experience informed the analysis, we separately used a collaborative analysis methodology (Cornish et al., 2013) in a workshop with nine service users and carers to identify candi- date mechanisms of action and outcomes at any level (Jennings et al., 2018). Minutes, flipchart outputs and researcher field notes from the workshop were used to identify themes, which were integrated into the analysis of the key publications to pro- duce a preliminary framework characterising mechanisms of action and outcomes at staff, services and societal levels. To refine the framework, semi-structured interviews were then conducted with stakeholders from the three study sites, compris- ing: people directly involved with Recovery Colleges, i.e. man- agers, peer trainers with lived experience, non-peer trainers with professional or topic-specific expertise, students; commu- nity-based and mental health service-based partners; and com- missioners. The preliminary framework informed the topic guide.",
    "Each interview lasted 30-60 min, and involved open ques- tions about mechanisms and outcomes at the three levels, fol- lowed by questions about the validity and comprehensiveness of the preliminary framework. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and coded using NVivo 11 by three researchers using six pre- defined superordinate codes (mechanisms and actions for staff, services and societal levels). Themes were coded at the relevant level (staff, services, societal) independent of the participant's per- spective (e.g. student, staff, etc.).",
    "After nine transcripts were coded, researchers met to compare and merge coding frame- works. The refined framework was applied to all remaining tran- scripts, with iterative discussion and further refinementto produce the final coding framework for each level.",

Staff level The final coding framework for the staff level is shown in Table 2.",
    "The most frequently proposed mechanism of change for staff was a softening of established roles, which was linked to the envir- onment and to staff-student interactions in attending and deliver- ing courses.

Many Recovery Colleges develop in a protected and low- visibility space within the host organisation, allowing them to 'I don't think anybody particularly noticed grow un-hindered: [the college]' (Non-peer trainer #3). Positive risk-taking encour- aged in Recovery Colleges was identified as a specific difference from the risk aversion of the wider organisation, increasing the perceived distance between the college and other services.

Cost and resource savings The most frequently reported impact of Recovery Colleges was on public attitudes, by reducing negative assumptions about people with mental health problems. Increased social inclusion through more friendships and better integration into the commu- nity was proposed.",
    "Benefits for community organisations from working with Recovery Colleges were also identified, through increased public and increased to their co-production in their own work. services access development within services, with lowered discriminatory assumptions about the abilities of workers with lived experience and more willingness to make workplace adjustments. The possi- bility of workforce exploitation was noted, along with concerns about how far Recovery Colleges would spread.",
    "Everything we do is in line with peers...the cultural effect of the Recovery College on this organisation has been a proliferation of co-production. (NHS manager #1) there would be...resistance at it becoming a dominant way of delivering services...because of the tendency everywhere to fall to the status quo.",
    "(Commissioner #2) It allows people to...be involved a bit more in the community. (Community partner organisation #4) Because if they [community partner] see how well it [co-production] works...they're more likely to go back and think 'Oh OK that's how we should do things again' really.",
    "(Recovery College Manager #2) Discussion This is the first study to use mixed-methods research to identify candidate mechanisms of action and outcomes for Recovery Colleges at staff, services and societal levels. Inductive document analysis and interviews with a wide range of Recovery College stake holders identified candidate mechanisms of action and out- come at each level.",
    "Societal level The final coding framework for the societal level is shown in Table 4. The most frequently coded mechanism was working with community organisations to co-produce courses. This was nearly always described as positive, though adapting courses to Recovery College requirements was sometimes challenging for the commu- nity partner.",
    "This enabled community organisations to engage with students they might not otherwise have worked with: So it's really helpful to be able to do what we do with a different group of people. (Community partner organisation #3) Change at the staff level The richest data were elicited for changes in staff.",
    "Staff involve- ment in a Recovery College, including attending and co-running courses, has the potential to impact on staff attitude and behav- iour, e.g. towards co-production and shared decision-making (Slade, 2017). Specific examples were positive interactions with peer trainers and experiencing co-production.",
    "This may be viewed as an approach to reducing in-system stigma, i.e. stigmatising beliefs held by health professionals in relation to people with mental ill-health (Henderson et al., 2014). Clinicians meeting ser- vice users in traditional clinical contexts do not improve attitudes A. Crowther et al. (Thornicroft et al., 2016).",
    "It is plausible that the intergroup con- tacts between staff and service user in a Recovery College context have more prejudice-reducing features: participants have equal status; co-operation around common goals is encouraged; contact is normative, i.e. has institutional support; and meaningful repeated contacts support friendship development (Al Ramiah and Hewstone, 2013). Peer work is an important global innovation in the mental health system (Puschner, 2018). A change model for peer workers has been developed (Gillard et al., 2015), but not yet specifically for peer trai- ners.",
    "Similarly, co-production is a new way of transforming systems, but recent evaluations indicate it is complex to implement (Parker et al., 2018). A primary impact of Recovery Colleges on staff arises from seeing these two innovations in practice. Change at the service level Recovery Colleges in England have emerged without central com- missioning and in the context of economic austerity when many mental health and social care systems are under considerable finan- cial pressure.",
    "Two mechanisms emerged as influential at the system level: organisational separation and organisational image. The separation of Recovery Colleges from its host institution has potential negative impacts, such as low staff awareness about the Recovery College and reduced opportunity to impact on mainstream services (Zabel et al., 2016).",
    "However, participants mainly identified positive benefits from separation, in allowing the creation and sustaining of a different organisational culture, based on educational rather than clinical concepts, and using co-production rather than solely professional views to lead the service. Insufficient separation has been shown to reduce fidelity in other alternative systems, such as consumer-run services (Segal and Hayes, 2016).",
    "The emergence of organisational image as an influence on uptake may explain the success of Recovery Colleges in opening in England during a period of austerity - Recovery Colleges meet both the goal of having a demonstrable service focused on recovery in alignment with national policy (HM Government, 2011) and the group-level process of social desirability (neigh- bouring organisations have one so we should have one). Both these mechanisms can be seen as arising from the Recovery College features of being a discrete new approach which need not disrupt existing service culture.",
    "However, it has been argued that viewing recovery as something 'done' in one part of an organisation fails to engage with the need for cross- organisation transformation (Slade et al., 2014). Recent challenges to traditional mental health systems (United Nations General Assembly, 2017) indicate that this separation may be a short-term approach to allow Recovery Colleges to flourish, but in longer term, the wider system culture needs to be transformed before col- leges can both flourish and be fully integrated.",
    "Change at the societal level Mechanisms and outcomes at the societal level were least consid- ered, perhaps indicating that the focus of most participants was identified mechanisms involved in-system transformation. All increased interaction between mental health stakeholders and wider community stakeholders, and the most identified beneficial outcome related to stigma.",
    "The experience of discrimination by people with mental health problems is widespread (Webber et al., 2014) (Corker et al., 2016), and anti-stigma initiatives to impact on service users' responses to have the potential discrimination (Sampogna et al., 2017).",
    "Recovery Colleges and anti-stigma programmes share the aim of increased community participation as a result of reduced discrimination and reduced self-stigma. The extent to which Recovery Colleges can improve community attitudes towards mental ill-health merits further investigation.",
    "The study has several strengths. It is the first study to address the multiple levels at which Recovery Colleges have an impact.",
    "It was developed using both primary and secondary data to enhance validity, used a range of stakeholder perspectives, and included consideration both of positive and negative mechanisms and out- comes. A limitation of the study is the challenge of separating impact at different levels.",
    "Respondent attributions of change to staff v. change in the system may constitute a category error. Other limitations are the small, albeit diverse, sample who are likely to have self-selected for their positive views, the absence of family perspectives and the potential bias arising from involve- ment of some authors in Recovery Colleges. Future research This study can be extended in three ways.",
    "First, it provides a pre- liminary theory base for the future development of a testable change model at each level. Developing a change model is neces- sary for formal evaluation of the impact of Recovery Colleges at each level. The next step will involve creating a formal change model showing proposed connections between specific mechan- isms and measurable outcomes. It is likely that causal connection will emerge between different levels.",
    "For example, improved stu- dent outcomes may positively impact on staff hopefulness about recovery, on service culture by raised expectations about shared decision-making, and on societal outcomes through more visible contributions by people with mental health problems in local communities. The resulting change model will then need to be validated by feedback from stakeholders. Our study suggests that, for this specific research question, service user students should not be the main stakeholder group as their focus is on the student level.",
    "The final stage will then involve observational or experimental research to test the change model in practice. Second, we noted the absence of consideration in reviewed publications of potential harms from Recovery Colleges, presum- ably because as with any health innovation, a very positive mes- sage about the content and potential benefit of the intervention is initially needed.",
    "Stakeholder interviews highlighted a range of possible negative consequences, such as exploitation of peer work- ers. This suggests that the field is maturing and some potentially negative consequences are becoming visible.",
    "Future Recovery College evaluations should investigate and report (Ioannidis et al., 2004) unwanted effects as well as benefits. Finally, our identification of candidate mechanisms and out- comes at each level can inform the evaluation of Recovery Colleges.",
    "The key outcomes to emerge are staff perceptions about service users, service-level use of co-production and devel- opment of a peer workforce, and public attitudes. Each of these outcomes is measurable and can inform a more contextual evalu- ation in a randomised controlled trial (Moore et al., 2014).",
    "Implications This study has implications for new and existing Recovery Colleges. Investing in Recovery Colleges has the potential not Epidemiology and Psychiatric Sciences only to benefit mental health service users. A range of outcomes for mental health staff and services and wider society has been identified.",
    "The resulting framework can inform commissioning and organisational arrangements. The level of integration between the college and the host should be actively managed.",
    "Aspects to consider include shared v. separate buildings, paperwork, processes and workforce. A pro- tected space enables the college to develop a distinct counter- culture, but closer integration increases the extent to which the Recovery College will influence culture in the host organisation.",
    "If the main focus is on beneficial impacts on the mental health and social care system, then the distinct identity of the Recovery College needs to be actively managed, staff encouraged to view their Recovery College experiences as providing them with experi- ential resources to be used in the host organisation, and efforts made to invite co-production and peer workforce developments in the host organisation. Similarly, if the focus is on societal change, then courses specifically targeted at family and community mem- bers, and active engagement with community agencies are priorities.",
    "The potential benefits of Recovery College beyond mental health service users are coming into focus. This study provides a first theoretical foundation for investigating Recovery Colleges as an approach to organisational and societal transformation.",

    "An evidence-based public health training course developed in 1997 by the Prevention Research Center in St. Louis has been taught by a transdisciplinary team multiple times with positive results. In order to scale up evidence-based practices, a train-the-trainer initiative was launched in 2010.",
    "Methods: This study examines the outcomes achieved among participants of courses led by trained state-level faculty. Participants from trainee-led courses in four states (Indiana, Colorado, Nebraska, and Kansas) over three years were asked to complete an online survey.",
    "Attempts were made to contact 317 past participants. One-hundred forty-four (50.9 %) reachable participants were included in analysis.",
    "Outcomes measured include frequency of use of materials, resources, and other skills or tools from the course; reasons for not using the materials and resources; and benefits from attending the course. Survey responses were tabulated and compared using Chi-square tests. Results: Among the most commonly reported benefits, 88 % of respondents agreed that they acquired knowledge about a new subject, 85 % saw applications for the knowledge to their work, and 78 % agreed the course also improved abilities to make scientifically informed decisions at work.",
    "The most commonly reported reasons for not using course content as much as intended included not having enough time to implement evidence-based approaches (42 %); other staff/peers lack training (34 %); and not enough funding for continued training (34 %). The study findings suggest that utilization of course materials and teachings remains relatively high across practitioner groups, whether they were taught by the original trainers or by state-based trainers.",
    "Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that train-the-trainer is an effective method for broadly disseminating evidence-based public health principles. Train-the-trainer is less costly than the traditional method and allows for courses to be tailored to local issues, thus making it a viable approach to dissemination and scale up of new public health practices.

    "BMC Health Services Research (2015) 15:547 Page 2 of 10 Background Public health is a diverse field, employing people from a variety of backgrounds in a wide range of occupations [1].",
    "The occupations are as varied as the level of education, which range from high school diplomas to doctoral degrees. Data that are available suggest that less than half of the public health workforce has formal training in public health [2, 3].",
    "Further limiting the standardization of skills across roles is the lack of formal core competencies or certification criteria for most practitioners [4]. Long-term solutions for filling this gap in preparedness include on-the-job training as a way to disseminate knowledge and enhance skills of public health practitioners. Yet training opportunities vary widely by region and face myriad challenges including high staff turnover, lack of available trainers locally, and restric- tions on travel that would allow participation in continuing education [5-7]. Workforce capacity building in public health has been an area of focus for decades since attention was drawn to the inadequate public health infrastructure",
    "[3, 4, 8, 9]. Strength- ening the public health infrastructure was a driving force behind the formation of the Public Health Accreditation Board, which developed accreditation standards and mea- sures for public health agencies [10, 11].",
    "Assuring work- force competence is one of the 10 domains. Part of this domain focuses on assessing knowledge and skill gaps and providing appropriate training.",
    "The final domain specific- ally addresses contributing to and applying the evidence base of public health [11].",
    "Beginning in the 1990's and following the lead estab- lished in medicine, public health recognized the need to identify the evidence of effectiveness for different interven- tions, translate that evidence into recommendations for practice, and increase the extent to which that evidence is used [12-14]. Evidence-based public health (EBPH) has been described as the integration of science-based inter- ventions with community preferences to improve popula- tion health",
    "[15]. By its nature, EBPH is an iterative and dynamic process as it takes place in natural settings rather than in controlled experimental situations.",
    "Because EBPH is a relatively new approach to public health practice, many practitioners, regardless of educational background, have not received formal training on this topic. One of the most widely disseminated training efforts to improve evidence- based decision making in public health has been a course developed in 1997 in Missouri [12]. The EBPH course, of- fered in a 2.5 to 4-day format, includes 9 modules that cover the core principles of evidence-based public health from problem definition through program development to evaluation",
    "[7, 12, 16-18]. It is designed to provide tools and information that will improve skills for evidence-based decision making among public health practitioners.",
    "Initially, the EBPH course was taught exclusively in Missouri for state and local public health practitioners. In an attempt to broaden the reach of training, the Cen- ters for Disease Control and Prevention began its sup- port of a national course in 2002. This annual training draws 25-35 participants from state and local govern- ment, non-governmental organizations (e.g., American Cancer Society, YMCA), and other sectors. In the first long-term evaluation of EBPH, which included Missouri and national participants from 2001-2004, 90 % of re- spondents reported that the course helped them make informed decisions in the workplace and 82 % of partici- pants reported that the course content helped them communicate better with co-workers [7].",
    "While partici- pants value the course and content, its reach into the public health workforce is not complete due to a num- ber of barriers. Based on both qualitative and quantita- tive evaluations, one of the leading barriers to applying the skills taught in the course is not having co-workers who are also trained in EBPH",
    "[5, 19, 20]. To ensure a critical mass of workers with a common lan- guage and understanding of EBPH, training must be \"scaled up.\"",
    "Scalability is the process by which an interven- tion shown to be efficacious on a small scale (under controlled conditions) is expanded under real world condi- tions to reach a broader practice or policy audience [21, 22]. Scaling-up a public health innovation like the EBPH training program would improve coverage and access to the training and its intended benefits by reducing cost, util- izing in-state trainers who are knowledgeable of local is- sues, and encouraging collaboration among researchers and staff from neighboring universities and local and state public health departments.",
    "The process of scaling-up re- quires an implementation plan that considers the context, delivery mechanisms, and resource requirements of the program [23, 24].",
    "In an effort to scale up the EBPH training course, the program was expanded in 2010 to begin taking the train- ing to states with the aim of building EBPH capacity within those health departments and leveraging their ex- pertise to train co-workers and others. The approach, funded by the National Association of Chronic Disease Directors (NACDD), was a train-the-trainer program.",
    "Train-the-trainer programs are used in a wide variety of fields for workforce development, including public health preparedness [25]; occupational safety [26]; nutrition educa- tion [27], health care issues [28-32]; and a variety of clinical interventions [33, 34].",
    "Train-the-trainer approaches have been used extensively in HIV prevention and education to train clinicians and peers [35-40]. There are a number of potential advantages to train-the-trainer approaches, the most obvious being to reach larger audiences through sub- sequent training activities led by those who were trained initially. Assuming the trainees are local to the audiences they will train, they may have more direct access to those communities and better understanding of contextual issues Yarber et al. BMC Health Services Research (2015) 15:547",
    "Page 3 of 10 affecting application of training. Building capacity at the local level also has the potential for enhancing collaboration and networking among those trained and for sustaining the training [25].",
    "Despite its widespread use and potential benefits, the literature on the effectiveness of train-the-trainer ap- proaches is limited. A contributing factor is that many of those who participate in train-the-trainer programs do not replicate training sessions at the local level [41]. For example, only 20 % of those trained in disaster prepared- ness [25] conducted a replication training 6 months after they were trained.",
    "Similarly, in a study of perinatal HIV prevention and care training, only 20 % went on to con- duct training after being trained [36]. In the EBPH train-the-trainer program, state chronic dis- ease units were invited to apply for on-site training by the PRC-StL faculty; they were encouraged to involve faculty from local schools of public health in the process.",
    "A condi- tion of award was that states agree to replicate the course at least once in the subsequent year, to be taught by in- state trainers who had completed the training course. Each year, one to two states were selected to have train- ing on site.",
    "Twenty-five to forty participants, including public health practitioners from state and local govern- ment along with their partners from academic centers and community organizations, were trained in each state. Be- tween 2010 and 2015, ten states received training. To date, six states have replicated the course two or more times; three have offered it once, and two are in the planning stages for their first or second replication.",
    "Among the participants in the initial training were people who had been previously identified as potential fu- ture trainers. After the initial training, local trainers were provided support materials, including guidance on adult learning techniques and dialogue education, as well as technical assistance from a NACDD contractor, who also worked closely with a local coordinator throughout the process and served as a liaison between state-based faculty and the original training team.",
    "Several steps were taken to maximize course fidelity. All replication courses included the same nine core modules as the original training.",
    "While the objectives, framework, and essential content remained the same, the state-based trainers were encouraged to consider their state's priorities and incorporate local data and relevant program and policy examples wherever appropriate. The NACDD contractor and course developers collaborated with states on tailoring and any other proposed changes to the content or format.",
    "At the time of their first replication, new trainers were also observed and provided constructive feedback. Innovative products, programs and practices often fall short of realizing their full impact due to scaling-up chal- lenges.",
    "Fortunately, research interest in scale-up and spread is increasing [21, 42]. However, much of the literature on scaling-up of innovations to date has focused on barriers and facilitators",
    "[23, 43]. In this paper, we evaluate a train-the-trainer approach to scaling up.",
    "We describe the application of training concepts and tools by participants of courses led by trained state-level staff and the reach of training by those states. As EBPH is a com- plex, iterative approach to decision making in public health",
    "[6], assessing gains in knowledge and skills from in- dividual modules provides a limited picture. Instead, im- plementation of core concepts is measured and used as a proxy for gains in knowledge and skills.",
    "Methods This research was approved by the Saint Louis Univer- sity Institutional Review Board. In this evaluation, we surveyed public health practitioners who attended a state-sponsored EBPH course between 2011 and 2013 in Colorado, Indiana, Kansas, or Nebraska. Total replications per state ranged from one to five during that time period.",
    "In total, 317 past attendees were contacted via email and invited to take a brief (10 min on average) survey in Qualtrics [44]. To increase response rate, par- ticipants received two reminder emails, a phone call, and a final reminder email. The survey remained open for 3 months.",
    "The 34 course attendees not reachable by email, who had no working phone number and/or no longer worked at the health department, were deemed unreachable, leaving a possible 283 respondents. The final response rate was 50.9 % (144/283).",
    "Along with background characteristics, the survey in- cluded questions on the frequency of use of materials, re- sources, and other skills or tools from the course; reasons for not using the materials and resources as much as intended; and benefits from attending the course. Use of materials/skills was measured with a four-point frequency scale (seldom/never, quarterly, monthly, or weekly).",
    "Course benefits and reasons for less than intended material/skill use was measured on a 5-point Likert scale (from strongly disagree to strongly agree). The survey also included open- ended questions where participants were invited to de- scribe the most useful parts of the training and what could have been done differently to improve the course.",
    "The sur- vey instruments are available from the last author and in Additional file 1. We calculated frequencies and conducted descriptive statistics to explore participant characteristics and re- sponses. Similar to other work [7, 19, 45], we compared data across three mutually exclusive groups-state health department, local health department (county or city), and participants from an agency other than a health depart- ment such as a university or community organization.",
    "We conducted Chi-square tests to determine statistical differ- ences in proportions across the three participant groups. Statistical significance was determined at p < 0.05. No Yarber et al.",
    "BMC Health Services Research (2015) 15:547 Page 4 of 10 relationships were found in regard to clustering by state, therefore no adjustments were made in regard to state membership because the survey assessed individual-level opinions on the personal competencies.",
    "For qualitative analysis of open-ended items, responses were grouped and coded for main themes. Direct quotes were then selected to represent the main themes that emerged. Results Respondent characteristics Among respondents, most (56 %) were from local city or county health departments (Table 1).",
    "In addition, a little over a quarter (26 %) were from state health departments and another 13 % were from various other organizations such as universities (5 %), community-based organizations (5 %) and other non-profit and health-related entities (3 %). Program manager or coordinator was the most often reported type of job position (35 %), followed by health educator or community health worker (25 %). Eleven per- cent of the sample was considered upper agency manage- ment (e.g., division or bureau heads, directors, deputies).",
    "Almost half (49 %) held at least a master's degree (16 % with a Master of Public Health) as their highest degree earned with just over a fourth (26 %) with a bachelor's de- gree or less. Areas of specialization among participants var- ied widely.",
    "More than one-third (36 %) specialized in health promotion.

    "Two benefits were more often cited among train-the- trainer participants (acquire new knowledge, adapt to a community's needs) whereas one benefit was more common among traditional format respondents (imple- ment evidence-based practices in a CDC/federally funded program). Participants reporting that they used EBPH materials and skills in planning a new program at least monthly fluctuated only slightly (nonsignificantly) between the traditional and train-the-trainer formats. Barriers to EBPH, as noted in the current study, provide the context for developing and scaling up public health training programs. Although the rankings and percentages vary slightly among the studies of the EBPH program to date, three barriers have consistently been among those most commonly cited: not having enough time, not having funding, and not having co-workers who are also trained in EBPH",
    "[5, 7, 19, 20, 46]. To address the issue of ad- equate time for applying EBPH concepts, the course seeks to identify user-friendly tools that are readily available to practitioners (e.g., the Community Guide, the National Network of Libraries of Medicine) [47].",
    "The lack of co- workers trained in EBPH points to the need for a \"critical mass\" of committed staff and a social network in support of evidence-based decision making [48, 49]. Having trainers who live and work in-state provides local EBPH experts in the workplace, allowing for more rapid spread of EBPH processes through enhanced communication and ongoing collaboration among colleagues.",
    "A few limitations of the current evaluation deserve note. First, the data collected are self-reported, measur- ing respondents' perceptions of learning and impacts.

With nearly half the adult population in the United States and Canada having literacy levels below what is needed to fully engage in an information-rich society, the implications for using information technology to promote health and aid in health care, or for eHealth, are considerable.",
    "Engaging with eHealth requires a skill set, or literacy, of its own. The concept of eHealth literacy is introduced and defined as the ability to seek, find, understand, and appraise health information from electronic sources and apply the knowledge gained to addressing or solving a health problem. In this paper, a model of eHealth literacy is introduced, comprised of multiple literacy types, including an outline of a set of fundamental skills consumers require to derive direct benefits from eHealth.",
    "A profile of each literacy type with examples of the problems patient-clients might present is provided along with a resource list to aid health practitioners in supporting literacy improvement with their patient-clients across each domain. Facets of the model are illustrated through a set of clinical cases to demonstrate how health practitioners can address eHealth literacy issues in clinical or public health practice. Potential future applications of the model are discussed.",

Consumer-directed eHealth resources, from online interventions to informational websites, require the ability to read text, use information technology, and appraise the content of these tools to make health decisions.",
    "Yet, even in countries with high rates of absolute access to the Internet, such as the United States and Canada, over 40% of adults have basic (or prose) literacy levels below that which is needed to optimally participate in civil society [1,2]. A multi-country study of information technology use and literacy found that as literacy http://www.jmir.org/2006/2/e9/ XSL*FO RenderX skill levels rise, the perceived usefulness of computers, diversity and intensity of Internet use, and use of computers for task-oriented purposes rise with it, even when factors such as age, income, and education levels are taken into account [3].",
    "If eHealth is to realize its potential for improving the health of the public, the gap between what is provided and what people can access must be acknowledged and remedied. Greater emphasis on the active and informed consumer in health and health care [4] in recent years has led to the realization that ensuring the public has both access to and adequate comprehension of health information is both a problem [5] and an achievable goal for health services",

    "[6]. Health Literacy The IOM report focuses largely on health literacy, using the following definition (originally proposed by Ratzan and Parker [7]): \"the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions\" [7].",
    "This definition underscores the importance of contextual factors that mediate health information and the need to consider health literacy in relation to the medium by which health resources are presented. Within a modern health information environment, this context includes the following: interactive behavior change tools, informational websites, and telephone-assisted services, which are all being deployed globally to promote health and deliver health care (eg, [8-[11]). However, even among North American adolescents, the highest Internet-use population in the world, many teens report that they lack the skills to adequately engage online health resources effectively [12].",
    "There is a gap between the electronic health resources available and consumers' skills for using them. By identifying and understanding this skill set we can better address the context of eHealth service delivery [13].",
    "As we witness the impact that basic literacy has on health outcomes, questions arise about how literacy affects eHealth-related outcomes and experiences [14]. But unlike literacy in the context of paper-based resources, the concept of literacy and health in electronic environments is much less defined.",
    "Consumer eHealth requires basic reading and writing skills, working knowledge of computers, a basic understanding of science, and an appreciation of the social context that mediates how online health information is produced, transmitted, and received--or what can be called eHealth literacy. A definition and model of eHealth literacy is proposed below that describes the skills required to support full engagement with eHealth resources aimed at supporting population health and patient care. eHealth Literacy Model The Lily Model Eng (2001) defines eHealth as \"the use of emerging information and communication technology, especially the Internet, to improve or enable health and health care",
    "[15]; this is one of many published definitions currently in use [16].",
    "Taken in the context of the IOM's definition of health literacy stated above, the concept of eHealth literacy is proposed. Specifically, eHealth literacy is defined as the ability to seek, find, understand, and appraise health information from electronic sources and apply the knowledge gained to addressing or solving a health problem. Unlike other distinct forms of literacy, eHealth literacy combines facets of different literacy skills and applies them to eHealth promotion and care. At its heart are six core skills (or literacies): traditional literacy, scientific literacy, media literacy, and computer literacy.",
    "The relationship of these individual skills to each other is depicted in Figure 1. Using the metaphor of a lily, the petals (literacies) feed the pistil (eHealth literacy), and yet the pistil overlaps the petals, tying them together.",
    "literacy, health information literacy, Within the lily model, the six literacies are organized into two central types: analytic (traditional, media, information) and context-specific (computer, scientific, health). The analytic component involves skills that are applicable to a broad range of information sources irrespective of the topic or context (Figure 2), while the context-specific component (Figure 3) relies on more situation-specific skills. For example, analytic skills can be applied as much to shopping or researching a term paper as they can to health. Context-specific skills are just as important; however, their application is more likely to be contextualized within a specific problem domain or circumstance.",
    "Thus, computer literacy is dependent upon what type of computer is used, its operating system, as well as its intended application. Scientific literacy is applied to problems where research-related information is presented, just as health literacy is contextualized to health issues as opposed to shopping for a new television set. Yet, both analytic and context-specific skills are required to fully engage with electronic health resources.",
    "eHealth literacy is influenced by a person's presenting health issue, educational background, health status at the time of the eHealth encounter, motivation for seeking the information, and the technologies used. Like other literacies, eHealth literacy is not static; rather, it is a process-oriented skill that evolves over time as new technologies are introduced and the personal, social, and environmental contexts change. Like other literacy types, eHealth literacy is a discursive practice that endeavors to uncover the ways in which meaning is produced and inherently organizes ways of thinking and acting [17,18].",

Traditional Literacy This concept is most familiar to the public and encompasses basic (or prose) literacy skills such as the ability to read text, understand written passages, and speak and write a language coherently[19].",
    "Technologies such as the World Wide Web are still text dominant, despite the potential use of sound and visual images on websites. Basic reading and writing skills are essential in order to make meaning from text-laden resources. A related issue is language itself. Over 65% of the World Wide Web's content is in English[20], meaning that English-speakers are more likely to find an eHealth resource that is understandable and meets their needs.",
    "Information Literacy The American Library Association suggests that an information literate person knows \"how knowledge is organized, how to find information, and how to use information in such a way that others can learn from them\" [21].",
    "Like other literacies, this definition must be considered within the context of the social processes involved in information production, not just its application [19]. An information literate person knows what potential resources to consult to find information on a specific topic, can develop appropriate search strategies, and can filter results to extract relevant knowledge. If one views the Web as a library, with search tools (eg, Google) and a catalogue of over eight billion resources, the need for Web users to know how to develop and execute search strategies as well as comprehend how this knowledge is organized becomes imperative.",

    "2 | e9 | p. 5 (page number not for citation purposes) JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH Norman & Skinner Media Literacy The wide proliferation of available media sources has spawned an entire field of research in the area of media literacy and media studies.",
    "Media literacy is a means of critically thinking about media content and is defined as a process to \"develop metacognitive reflective strategies by means of study\" [22] about media content and context. Media literacy is a skill that enables people to place information in a social and political context and to consider issues such as the marketplace, audience relations, and how media forms in themselves shape the message that gets conveyed. This skill is generally viewed as a combination of cognitive processes and critical thinking skills applied to media and the messages that media deliver [23].",
    "Health Literacy As discussed earlier, health literacy pertains to the skills required to interact with the health system and engage in appropriate self-care. The American Medical Association considers a health literate person as having \"a constellation of skills, including theability to perform basic reading and numerical tasks required to function in the health care environment. Patients with adequate health literacy can read, understand, and act on health care information\"",
    "[24]. Consumers need to understand relevant health terms and place health information into the appropriate context in order to make appropriate health decisions. Without such skills, a person may have difficulty following directions or engaging appropriate self-care activities as needed.",
    "Computer Literacy Computer literacy is the ability to use computers to solve problems[25]. Given the relative ubiquity of computers in our society, it is often assumed that people know how to use them. Yet, computer literacy is nearly impossible without quality access to computers and current information technology. For example, it is not helpful to learn PC-based commands on a Mac, to learn Windows 98 if one requires Windows XP, or be trained on a laptop when a personal digital assistant (PDA) is required for a task.",
    "Computer literacy includes the ability to adapt to new technologies and software and includes both absolute and relative access to eHealth resources. To illustrate this, Skinner and colleagues found that while nearly every Canadian teenager has access to the Internet, far fewer have the quality of access or the ability to fully utilize it for health [26,27]. Scientific Literacy",
    "This is broadly conceived as an understanding of the nature, aims, methods, application, limitations, and politics of creating knowledge in a systematic manner [28]. The latter-mentioned political and sociological aspects of science are in response to earlier conceptions of science as a value-free enterprise, a position that has been vigorously challenged [28-30].",
    "For those who do not have the educational experience of exposure to scientific thought, understanding science-based online health information may present a formidable challenge. Science literacy places health research findings in appropriate context, allowing consumers to understand how science is done, the largely incremental process of discovery, and the limitations--and opportunities--that research can present.",
    "The Six Literacy Types Taken together, these six literacy types combine to form the foundational skills required to fully optimize consumers' experiences with eHealth. A profile of each literacy type with examples of the problems patient-clients might present is summarized in Table 1. Also included is a list of resources, many of them Web-based, that can be consulted to help health practitioners support patient-clients in improving their literacy skills across each domain.",
    "Although it would not be unexpected to find that older adults and those from nonindustrialized countries report greater difficulties in certain domains, particularly those that are context-specific, it is the authors' experience that few assumptions about which groups or individuals are likely to encounter difficulties can be made. As work with highly Internet-connected populations (like North American adolescents) shows, many of whom we would expect to be skilled users, there is a lack of skills, opportunity, and environments to use eHealth to its fullest potential [12,26,27]. http://www.jmir.org/2006/2/e9/ XSL*FO RenderX J Med Internet Res 2006 | vol. 8",

Many libraries offer special programs to teach patrons both computer and search skills for little or no cost.",
    "Some countries have job training centers that provide basic computer courses as part of their core mandate. Few widespread resources exist to teach people science literacy. The most common approach to learning about science is through formal education; how- ever, many science institutions such as universities and colleges have open lec- tures and educational events for the public on a regular basis. In Canada, the Royal Institute for the Advancement of Science holds monthly lectures on science topics to educate the public, as does the Royal Society in the UK.",
    "Two instruments have been developed and validated for use in assessing health literacy: The Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (TOFHLA) and the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM). Both have been widely used and are designed to assess health literacy within 30 minutes. The TOFHLA has 67 items and includes a numeracy component (the ability to read and understand numbers) and a reading comprehension component. The REALM has 66 items.",
    "Fostering health literacy is a challenge; however, attending to people's media preferences (text, video, audio) and using plain language in in- teractions is a place to begin.

Although one need not have mastery in all these areas to benefit from eHealth resources, it can be argued that without moderate skills across these literacies, effective eHealth engagement will be unlikely.",

    "Media Literacy: Teens need to know the difference between the perspectives presented on each site to make an informed decision. One site belongs to a tobacco company with a vested interest in selling cigarettes, and it advocates prevention strategies not supported by the best evidence. The other two sites are from a teen-focused research project at a public university and from a government health agency.",

The Media Awareness Network [37] has resources for working with children and youth in enhancing media literacy that can aid in fostering this dis- cussion. Traditional Literacy: A basic literacy assessment should be undertaken before recommending use of the Internet as a resource.",
    "This may be done by having the patient read a few simple text passages from consumer health materials or the newspaper or by asking the patient directly if he has difficulties reading. If basic text materials are difficult, the person is likely to require assistance in using the Web or other Internet resources even at a rudimentary level. Computer Literacy: If the man has limited experience with computers, specific training through a local library, community center, or other community program might be necessary to provide him with the means to use Web-assisted tobacco interventions.",
    "This requires that the practitioner arrange and assist the patient in connecting with one of these community resources or inquire if there are family members or friends who can assist him in getting online.

Information Literacy: A referral to the local library or on-staff librarian (if available) is the simplest strategy. A short tutorial on the use of search engines, search strategies, and health databases can provide the basics on how to navigate the Internet for health information. Once basic search strategies have been established, the patient may wish to use evidence-supported resources for evaluating consumer health information, available through tools such as the DISCERN Project websites [43,44].",

Science Literacy: This scenario presents a teachable moment to outline some of the issues that address science literacy, such as how evidence changes over time and issues of quality. In this case, it may be useful to direct the patient to reference sources outlining contrary views and encourage a dialogue around what makes good science. It is possible the research she has referred to is out of date, contested, or heavily biased (eg, tobacco-industry sponsored).",

It is worth ex- ploring the context around this behavior to see if it is a matter of fit between the NRT delivery method and the person or whether it is an issue of literacy. Patient instructions should be re- viewed to ensure that they are written in plain language. Practitioners may also wish to explore whether there are other media tools available from the manufacturer or local health unit that can be used to supplement the written instructions, such as visual aids or videos to reduce the amount of required reading.",
    "Discussion Literacy is as much a process as an outcome and requires constant attention and upgrading. The key is to reach a level of fluency at which one can achieve working knowledge of the particular language (or skill), enough to function at a level conducive to achieving health goals. Knowledge, information, and media forms are context-specific, and context dictates what skills and skill levels are required to access health resources.",
    "For example, technical jargon may be appropriate in academic discourse provided it allows for a more precise explanation of certain concepts. However, when directed at nontechnical consumers or those outside of a particular research or practice culture, technical language may need to undergo a translation process in order to convey a message properly[45].",

The eHealth literacy model presented here is the first step in understanding what these skills are and how they relate to the use of information technology as a tool for health. The next step is to apply this model to everyday conditions of eHealth use--patient care, preventive medicine and health promotion, population-level health communication campaigns, and aiding health professionals in their work--and evaluate its applicability to consumer health informatics in general. Using this model, evaluation tools can be created and systems designed to ensure that there is a fit between eHealth technologies and the skills of intended users.

From Caroline Wang and Mary Ann Burris's initial 1994 project, photovoice has demonstrated power to harness visual imagery and stories within a participatory empowerment process and established a new tool for the profession for understanding community members' lived experience and needs, raising the critical consciousness of communities, and advocating for actions leading to social change. Based in Freirean philosophy, feminist theory, and documentary photography, photovoice engages community members to identify, represent, and change their community by means of photography, dialogue, and action.",

Full implementations of photovoice have the capacity to illuminate complex real-world issues leading to advocacy for policy, systems, and environmental change. It is our hope that the proposed framing clarifies the language used to discuss photovoice and its outcomes, distinguishes its various uses and stated aims, and maximizes its impact in future applications.",
    "Keywords: advocacy | social determinants of health | social policy | environmental and systems change | community intervention | health promotion | health education | community-based participatory research | health research | qualitative research | community assessment | program planning and evaluation Article: Since its introduction, photovoice has been implemented in numerous fields with a wide array of outcomes of interest, but has the method been implemented in a way that is consistent with its initial aims? Caroline Wang and Mary Ann Burris, in their groundbreaking 1994 article, described the pioneering application of a form of participatory photography with rural women in the Yunnan Province of China, adopting the term photo novella. Their method, soon to be referred to as photovoice, was credited as the first application within the field of public health.",
    "The goal of photovoice was to \"use people's photographic documentation of their everyday lives as an educational tool to record and to reflect their needs, promote dialogue, encourage action, and inform policy\" (pp. 171-172) and was thus \"designed to include new voices in policy discussions by facilitating collective learning, expression, and action\" (p. 172). Their photovoice project successfully endeavored to \"cultivate people's ability to take individual and collective action for social change\" (p. 177).",
    "The participatory nature and action orientation of the photovoice method can be viewed as a manifestation of the foundational thinking and literature of people like Max Horkheimer (1937, 2002), whose \"critical theory\" focused on critiquing and changing society, and Kurt Lewin (1951), who directed our attention to the importance and need for participatory action processes where individuals and communities endeavor to gather and act on information that can address circumstances and benefit society (Reason & Bradbury, 2006). The participatory intent and power within the photovoice method to harness visual imagery and democratize community voice is in many ways predicated on this foundational literature. Photovoice, as an emerging participatory method, established a new tool for the profession with the potential to elicit community members' needs, raise critical consciousness of individuals and whole communities, and motivate actions needed for social change.",
    "As Wang and Burris (1994) described, photovoice is the \"daughter of many mothers\" as it is based in empowerment/Freirean philosophy, feminist theory, and documentary photography, which when combined, engages community members to identify, represent, and change their community through photography, dialogue, and action. Theoretical Foundations of Photovoice A fundamental tenet of the photovoice process is its potential for empowerment and moving participants through the Freirean stages of raising critical consciousness.",
    "Carlson et al. (2006) summarized the cognitive-emotional movement of individuals through four stages of critical consciousness, from passive adaptation to current community circumstances, through an emotional engagement with issues and a cognitive awakening to root causes, leading to the final stage of intentions to act. Critical consciousness \"involves people in the process that shifts their roles from learners to emerging leaders and social actors in their communities\" (Wang & Burris, 1994, p. 185). This transformation also occurs for a community-at-large, key decision- makers, or a group of influencers that may collectively move from a state of passive adaptation through emotional engagement and community introspection to a state of collective action.",
    "Using images as Freirean \"codes\" or tools to facilitate discussion, photovoice participants are invited to capture and share observations and insights from their lived experiences (decodification) and collectively arrive at a deeper understanding of a community issue (Freire, 1973). Feminist theory and thinking are embraced within photovoice and the belief that individuals should be the authorities of their own lives and advocate for productive solutions based on improved understanding of situations (Lykes & Scheib, 2015; Wang & Burris, 1994).",
    "Within photovoice, community residents are seen as experts, with shared grounded experiences worthy of representation through data collection and group reflection. The empowerment roots derived from Freirean and feminist thinking are the foundation of photovoice's use of deductive (observed) rather than inductive (hypothesis-driven/theoretical) construction of knowledge.",
    "The third and most pragmatic underpinning of photovoice lies within its use of photographic images to document lived realities (Wang & Burris, 1994). The impact of documentary photography on society can be traced from simple documentation of daily life to a critical reflection of realities enhanced or sometimes juxtaposed with social commentary; indeed, history is replete with examples of documentary images being pivotal in pricking the social conscience, shifting social awareness, and, frequently, social actions (Ewald, 1985; Riis, 1890/2012; Sontag, 1977; Stryker & Wood, 1973).",
    "Just as selected photos within journalistic messaging are intended to draw attention to ostensibly objective realities, photovoice elicits the same innate human attraction to the \"seen\" realities of others (Gubrium & Harper, 2013). Following Wang and Burris's (1994) article, researchers recognized that photovoice's theoretical grounds could be positioned within various research approaches or methodologies, including phenomenology (the discovery of contextualized truths from the perspective of participants), grounded theory (using the views of participants to explore linkages of factors to explain phenomena), and critical theory (the empowerment of participants to understand and act on issues explored) (Evans-Agnew et al., 2017; Horkheimer, 2002). Establishing a particular photovoice effort within a guiding methodological strategy can influence what is emphasized, such as uncovering lived realities of individuals and communities, exploring underlying root causes of social concerns, and/or enlisting allies for collective actions (Liebenberg, 2018).",
    "Figure 1. Social Ecological Model Separate from these and other methodological distinctions is the desired level of change within a social ecology from the individual level through larger social and structural shifts. The social ecological model (SEM; see Figure 1) communicates that an individual's health is influenced by their attitudes and behaviors, by community social structures, and by the reciprocal interplay among influences at the individual, interpersonal, organizational, community, and societal levels of the social ecology. A priori consideration of photovoice aims relative to these influences on individual and collective health is essential to the method (Strack et al., 2010) and, where possible, efforts should be taken to target causal factors at multiple levels of the social ecology (McLeroy et al., 1998; Stokols et al., 1996).",
    "While Strack et al. (2010) encouraged the use of the SEM framework to inform the planning and measurement of an individual photovoice project, here the intent is to establish a heuristic for categorizing the varied potential aims for the use of the photovoice method and to encourage those embarking on a photovoice endeavor to consider the outcomes they aspire to achieve. The methodological approach chosen, and the level of the social ecology targeted, should inform and guide our research and practice. While the photovoice method can influence individuals, its real power resides in the capacity to enable people to see root causes that might be addressed to improve the \"health of a community\" and subsequently the health of its members.",
    "Just as an X- ray depicts interior structures of a human body to diagnose a biological problem, photovoice can be a community-level diagnostic tool that looks beneath the surface to make visible social and structural challenges within a community. Photovoice participants can diagnose and advocate for policy, systems, and environmental change (PSE) at the community level, shifting its intervention focus to the \"community-as-patient\" in need of healing actions (McGavran, 1956).",
    "Photovoice's capacity to raise critical consciousness across all levels of the social ecology is the basis for Wang and Burris's (1994) aim for photovoice to be \"an educational tool to record and reflect needs, promote dialogue, encourage action, and inform policy\" (p. 172). Framing the Aims of Photovoice As the photovoice method continued to grow in application and utility since 1994, the stated purpose and terminology used to describe it has varied (e.g., photovoice/PhotoVoice, photo novella, auto-driven photo-elicitation, participatory photography). Literature reviews of the method reveal growing popularity among education, public health, community development, nursing, and social work researchers with an array of applications, aims, and outcomes (Catalani & Minkler, 2010; Hergenrather et al., 2009; Lal et al., 2012; Seitz & Strack, 2016; Wang, 2006).",
    "As a research tool, photovoice is an effective method of data collection. Where photovoice is used to alter knowledge, attitudes, skills, and behaviors of individuals and whole communities, it is ostensibly an intervention. As a driver of systemic change, photovoice has provided a platform for enabling community voice and participation in co-solutions, social justice, and seeking upstream solutions that address foundational causes for our health. In their review, Catalani and Minkler (2010) highlight the wide-ranging applications of the method since Wang and Burris's initial study and also note tailoring across settings with considerable variation in reported purposes, participation, and documentation of results.",
    "This article draws on the authors' experience with photovoice, careful examination of Wang and Burris's (1994) original contribution, and previous reviews (Catalani & Minkler, 2010; Hergenrather et al., 2009; Lal et al., 2012; Seitz & Strack, 2016; Wang, 2006) to propose a classification system that encapsulates the diverse purposes and desired outcomes of photovoice. As illustrated in Table 1, we propose the following categories for framing the application of the method; specifically, photovoice for (a) photovention, (b) community assessment, (c) community capacity building, and (d) advocacy for change. While the first three applications of photovoice may not, as described by Wang and Burris, \"encourage action and inform policy\" nor be directly tied to \"collective action for social change,\" they are applications of the photovoice process to animate power within a community and set the stage for actions that may facilitate advocacy for sustainable change.",
    "Our intent for revisiting the roots and aims of photovoice is to not only celebrate the adaptability and flexibility of the method for gathering data and engaging individuals and whole communities, but also as a referendum for encouraging the use of the method for its full potential as a tool to advocate for change. We hope that the proposed framing clarifies the language used to discuss photovoice and its outcomes, distinguishes its various uses and stated aims, and maximizes its impact in future applications.",

Proposed Photovoice Classifications Photovoice as individual-level intervention (photovention) Aims and Outcomes Example aims Photovoice as community assessment * Co-identification of problems and strengths * Baseline evaluation, needs assessment, and asset mapping * Increase of self- esteem, cultural identity, efficacy for change * Enhancement of individual knowledge, skills, attitudes, behaviors, and health Photovoice as community capacity building *",
    "Increase local voice, collective efficacy, internal community network, and advocacy capacity * Expand external networks and connections to power and influence Example outcomes * Participant self- efficacy as a change agent * Prioritized list of key issues and their root causes identified as most essential for change * Emergence of new leaders on key issues and the growth of new partners enlisted to promote change efforts Photovoice as advocacy for change * Reach policy and decision-makers * Agenda setting * Sustainable changes within an organization or system * Policy, systems, environmental (PSE) change * Gain access to and add agenda items to decision-making body; persuasive messaging that results in some form of (large or small) sustainable change Photovoice as a Photovention When the primary goal of a photovoice effort is to promote change within the participants themselves and not to address community concerns or broader social conditions, it is serving as an individual-level intervention and might best be categorized as photovention (Strack et al., 2010). Wang and Burris (1994) allude to the individual capacity building of the photovoice process; however, individual growth and empowerment, in accord with Freirean principles, are described as the means to other ends.",
    "Because practitioners and researchers have an ethical duty to not exploit a community for the sake of data collection (Evans-Agnew et al., 2022; Lorenz & Bush, 2022), it is important to plan for the use of the data collected for community improvement (Israel et al., 2005; Minkler & Wallerstein, 2008; Reason & Bradbury, 2006). \"The process emphasized the use of village women's documentation of their everyday lives as an educational tool to increase their individual and collective knowledge [emphasis added] about women's health status and to empower women to mobilize for social change.\" Wang and Burris (1994, p. 178)",
    "When considering common activities and potential outcomes of the individual level, some examples might include photovoice training in the philosophy of the method and appropriate advocacy skills (activities) that might lead to increased self-efficacy for being a pro-social change agent and community advocate (outcomes). While not sufficient for community change, these traits are necessary steps (mediators) within photovoice for subsequent stages of the process, such as planning events and advocating with key decision-makers of the community (Carlson et al., 2006). Photovoice for Community Assessment Photovoice's fundamental strength is the generation and analysis of images by community participants themselves, which not only highlight the values and priorities as identified by community members but are also used to promote community change and improvement (Strack et al., 2004; Wang & Burris, 1997; Wang et al., 1998, 2000).",
    "In contrast, within some settings and professions, the use of photographic images assembled by investigators for the primary purpose of data collection is referred to as photo-elicitation or auto-driven photo- elicitation (Clark & Morriss, 2015; Keller et al., 2008). Photovoice applied as part of community assessment provides not only a systematic method for data collection but also a powerful technique for self-generation of images that reflect lived experiences (Gubrium & Harper, 2013). \"As a needs assessment tool, photo novella (aka photovoice) provided a creative and appealing method by which village women and several Women's Federation cadres could document the health issues of greatest concern . . .",
    "providing an opportunity to document creatively and to discuss the community's problems, concerns, and hopes, and communicate them with policymakers.\" Wang and Burris (1994, pp. 178-179)",
    "The role of photovoice in community assessment is to identify community strengths and weaknesses as interpreted by community members themselves. When used as a tool for assessment, the participatory nature of photovoice includes community members who may be excluded from typical surveillance activities, thereby easing participation for those who experience difficulty reading, taking a survey, responding during an interview (Wang & Pies, 2008), or who might feel disempowered by outside-directed community assessment approaches (Wang & Burris, 1997). Visual images in photovoice applications primarily concerned with community assessment are valuable for gaining an insider's perspective of salient issues; however, for full utilization of the method, further facilitation is needed to attain PSE change outcomes.",
    "Photovoice for Community Capacity Building Imagery, whether in media or as shared through photovoice, has a rich history of being a catalyst for social change (Bogre, 2012). Visual images are a powerful way to involve those individuals and communities often excluded from civic discourse and are essential for capacity building within a community (Israel et al., 2005). The use of photovoice and other photography documentation methods to engage marginalized groups in community capacity building has been well established (Strack et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2000).",
    "Involvement and ownership of the participants and residents of a community at the helm of the project are essential to the success of community capacity-building efforts (Israel et al., 2005). The documentation and sharing of voices provide a platform for citizens to recognize and address power and challenge hegemonic views within society.",
    "\"From the outset, we envisioned photo novella as a method that would not only contribute to the needs assessment, but also enable women to document, discuss, and organize around their collective health interests, with the shared aim of improving life conditions in their communities.\" Wang and Burris (1994, p. 179) Social change does not occur by happenstance. Photovoice applications should attempt to create community capacity-building conditions in which participants and the community can develop and exercise the power to accomplish things, the power to work with others toward a common goal, and the power over actions in one's community (French, 1985; Wang et al., 2000). Because forces leading to PSE changes are typically located outside of the impacted community, the aim of the community capacity-development phase of the photovoice process intends to influence the critical consciousness of key decision-makers who have power over regulatory (laws and policies) and allocation (funding) decisions leading to more healthful PSE changes (Wang et al., 2000).",
    "Deliberate and collaborative efforts by photovoice participants, facilitators, and new allies developed through a photovoice effort are typically needed to get salient issues in front of decision-makers within a community (Wang et al., 2000). The degree to which photovoice participants are successful in harnessing and growing these sources of power and building a community's capacity is proportional to their subsequent ability to effect positive changes for the health of individual lives and their communities. For photovoice applications deploying a phenomenology or grounded theory approach, the participatory generation of data for understanding may satisfy an endeavor's primary aim.",
    "However, the highest aim for Wang and Burris (1994) was the use of the photovoice method for making systemic changes that would shape healthier living conditions for women in rural China. Applying photovoice as a photovention, community assessment, or community capacity-building effort are all critical and necessary elements of the method but may not be sufficient for the planning and actions needed to evoke advocacy for change. Photovoice for Advocacy and PSE Change Photovoice as a means for producing systems and policy change, through individual voice, assessment, and empowerment, was the central aim of the method from the beginning. Photovoice by design provides a vehicle for members of a community to enter the civic dialogue needed for influencing decision and policymakers (Wang & Burris, 1994, 1997). Ideally, the photovoice process should engender empowerment, leading to opportunities for those directly affected in a community to access and influence the knowledge, decisions, networks, and resources needed to improve local conditions, organizational practices, and communities (Strack et al., 2018; Wang & Burris, 1994; Wang 2022).",
    "It is important to note that \"systems\" change can be large substantive changes such as changes within laws, but they can also be small wins, such as new organizational or local resources, changes within a local organization's procedures, or even shifting a local decision-making body's agenda. \"A central aim of photo novella was to contribute to an environment where rural women's self-defined concerns entered programmatic and policy discussions.\" Wang and Burris (1994, p. 182)",
    "Within the public health field, an increasing emphasis is placed on the importance and role of citizen advocacy that leads to positive social policy changes (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010; Huang et al., 2015). The engagement of those most impacted by unhealthful and unfavorable social determinants is essential for improving the health of communities and society at large (Freudenberg, 2007; Huang et al., 2015).",
    "Photovoice reviews have illustrated the method's utility (if unmet actualization) for being an effective vehicle for addressing social determinants (Catalani & Minkler, 2010; Hergenrather et al., 2009; Lal et al., 2012; Seitz & Strack, 2016; Wang, 2006). The photovoice method's ability to mobilize communities to action directly impacts its potential to influence policy shifts, especially for implementations with higher participation rates; however, there has been limited measurement and reporting of salient processes for influencing policy, and limited reporting of outcomes and ultimate policy change (Catalani & Minkler, 2010). This may largely be due to the complex nature of policymaking, which has resulted in theoretical claims of influence absent empirical evidence (Guthrie et al., 2005; Reisman et al., 2007; Strack et al., 2018).",
    "Photovoice is a practical and powerful tool for the community's internal generation of knowledge and empowerment. The other applications of photovoice (i.e., photovention, community assessment, and community capacity building) are essential components of the method but, without additional planning and action, are by themselves less likely to achieve sustainable change leading to healthier living conditions. Using photovoice for advocacy and PSE-level change not only embraces the initial intent advocated by Wang and Burris (1994) but also results in the long-term sustainability of effects, where benefits for the community are felt well after research or intervention efforts end.",
    "Discussion The classification system presented here clarifies the diverse purposes of photovoice in practice and suggests to researchers more specific language for discussing its varied applications. Practitioners have acknowledged various purposes or outcomes of photovoice and used different terms to describe the wide-ranging processes; however, a necessary prerequisite of any photovoice effort is the generation of data from the members of the community itself.",
    "Not all applications of photovoice are appropriately implemented to address every level of need leading to PSEs. The classification system presented in this article highlights a hierarchical but dynamic relationship between the diverse purposes of photovoice in practice and encourages practitioners to maximize the impact of their efforts at every level. With systems-level targets of a fully implemented photovoice application, measurement issues become more complex and challenging.",
    "Modifying or preserving policy is typically the result of numerous factors that play out in the short and long term. Mechanisms of influence are difficult to discern and do not always follow an amenable and distinct causal chain of influence.",
    "Whereas there are examples of cause-and-effect relationships between advocacy efforts and policy change, this direct relationship is often difficult to demonstrate and may be one of the challenges inherent in reporting outcomes for community-level processes like photovoice that also target policy and systems change. Many advocacy efforts occur in complex systems with multiple actors influencing the situation under study. Because these naturally occurring social- environmental influences are common threats to external validity when claiming outcomes within advocacy research (Guthrie et al., 2005; Reisman et al., 2007; Strack et al., 2018), strategies are needed to identify and measure the intermediating steps that may lead to PSE changes.",
    "One of the main aims of Wang and Burris's (1994) photovoice efforts was to create an environment through which the voices of impacted communities could speak directly to decision- and policymakers. Because one of the main purposes of the photovoice process is to inform and influence policy shifts within a community, it is important for those carrying out photovoice efforts to monitor the steps leading to policy change as well as the policy shifts themselves.",
    "These steps can include contacts with policymakers and changes to their awareness, knowledge, and attitudes. Measurement of these preliminary changes and their ability to influence agenda-setting and the adoption of new policies or resource allocations are important for monitoring photovoice efforts.",
    "The challenging nature of evaluating PSE change and advocacy interventions may result in avoidance of these potentially more complex and longer- term evaluation designs (Guthrie et al., 2006). Figure 2.",
    "Photovoice Classifications Within the Social Ecological Model Framework Considering the emphasis on advocacy for changes beyond the individual, the authors assert that SEM is an appropriate framework for distinguishing uses and intended outcomes of photovoice (Catalani & Minkler, 2010; Strack et al., 2010). Overlaying activities and desired outcomes of the photovoice process with levels of the SEM keeps at the forefront Wang and Burris's (1994) initially stated purpose of \"collective action for social change\" (p. 177). Figure 2 illustrates a five-level version of the SEM, from considerations of individuals through societal and public policy influences (McLeroy et al., 1998; Sallis et al., 2008). A close examination of foundational literature and previous applications of photovoice revealed a similar pattern in which the intention was to change outcomes for individuals, collect data, build community capacity, and/or promote policy and social change (Catalani & Minkler, 2010; Hergenrather et al., 2009; Lal et al., 2012; Seitz & Strack, 2016; Wang, 2006; Wang & Pies, 2008; Wang et al., 1998).",
    "Within each level of the SEM, we can expect a degree of reciprocal interaction between levels of the environment (McLeroy et al., 1998; Stokols et al., 1996). While the direction and causal influences are not always discernible (Golden et al., 2015; Sallis et al., 2008; Weiner et al., 2012), we are working with the assertion that activities and their subsequent outcomes at each level have the potential to influence other levels; namely, that changes at one level may be a prerequisite for changes at higher levels; alternatively, factors at multiple levels may serve as an amplifier of changes at various levels (Weiner et al., 2012).",
    "Within the photovoice context, this allows us to consider the salient activities and expected outcomes at each level, and the potential positive impacts at one level influencing adjacent levels within the social environment. For example, we would expect that empowered individuals would capture salient images and stories (individual-level activities and outcomes), share their concerns with the community through public exhibits (interpersonal relationships), produce a cognitive awakening within key community stakeholders (organizations and community), and strengthen community advocacy for change which, if effective, results in community improvement (societal, public policy).",
    "Along the SEM continuum, we can carefully consider and measure expected activities and subsequent outcomes at each level, as a means for examining and strengthening strategies employed with each application of photovoice (Strack et al., 2010). Conclusion Since Wang and Burris's (1994) article and Wang et al.'s (2000) article in the inaugural issue of Health Promotion Practice, the journal and the profession have embraced and employed the power of the photovoice method.",
    "The photovoice classifications proposed here are offered as an attempt to encapsulate the diverse aims of photovoice and provide a common language. Needs assessment, dialogue, empowered action, and policy change were all seen as critical components of a photovoice effort, as Wang and Burris astutely highlighted in their 1994 article. And, as beautifully stated by Caroline Wang 28 years later in her submission to this same issue of Health Promotion Practice, \"please look in your heart, and may your work be rooted in the goals and core values that underlie photovoice\" (Wang 2022). As a multipurpose tool, the photovoice method can illuminate complex real-world issues leading to advocacy for PSE.",
    "While change is hard, it is possible with careful planning and resolve. We hope that our proposed framing contributes to the language used to discuss photovoice and its outcomes, distinguishes its various uses and stated aims, and maximizes its impact in future applications.",

    "This article is published with open access Abstract Tens-of-thousands of chemicals are registered in the U.S. for use in countless processes and products. Recent evidence suggests that many of these chemicals are measureable in environmental and/or biological systems, indicating the potential for widespread exposures.",
    "Traditional public health research tools, including in vivo studies and targeted analytical chemistry methods, have been unable to meet the needs of screening programs designed to evaluate chemical safety. As such, new tools have been developed to enable rapid assessment of potentially harmful chemical exposures and their attendant biological responses. One group of tools, known as \"non-targeted analysis\" (NTA) methods, allows the rapid characterization of thousands of never-before-studied compounds in a wide variety of environmental, residential, and biological media. This article discusses current applications of NTA methods, challenges to their effective use in chemical screening studies, and ways in which shared resources (e.g., chemical standards, databases, model predictions, and media measurements) can advance their use in risk-based chemical prioritization.",

    "Toxicity testing methods that support chemical safety evaluations have evolved rapidly, ushering in an era defined by high-throughput screening (HTS) and chemical prioritization [1, 2].",
    "Two US-based testing pro- grams--the Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century (Tox21) Federal Consortium and the EPA Toxicity Forecaster (ToxCast) project--have together evaluated over 8000 chemical substances across hundreds of bioassays [3-5].",
    "Efforts are underway to map the derived bioactivity data to key events along adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) in support of 21st century risk assessments and regulatory decisions [6, 7].",
    "Risk-based decisions, however, are wea- kened without quantitative knowledge of exposure, pro- cesses that link exposure and target dose, and the impact of J. R. Sobus et al. target dose on AOPs [8-11]. Noting this challenge, the exposure science community has mirrored recent advances in toxicity testing, developing both predictive and empirical methods for rapid acquisition of chemical exposure data [8, 9, 12, 13].",
    "Many measurement-based methods are borne out of successes in the metabolomics field. For example, high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), a common metabolomics tool, now allows rapid characterization of hundreds to thousands of compounds in a given environ- mental (e.g., surface water), residential (e.g., house dust), or biological (e.g., serum) sample. Whereas metabolomics has mostly eyed endogenous compounds, the emerging field of \"exposomics\" has broadened the analytical focus to include xenobiotic compounds",
    "[14, 15]. Popular open metabo- lomics databases, in fact, are expanding to include large lists of man-made compounds, as well as known and predicted metabolites of xenobiotics and naturally-occurring com- pounds [16-19].",
    "Furthermore, software developers are adapting existing tools, and developing new tools, to better meet the needs of the growing exposomics community [20, 21]. In time, these adaptations will enable fully inte- grated research workflows that seamlessly bridge empirical knowledge of stressors and biological adaptations to those stressors [10, 18].",
    "The concept of the \"exposome\" was introduced in 2005 by Dr. Christopher Wild as a way to represent all life-course environmental exposures from the prenatal period onwards [22]. Since that time, exposomics, like any nascent field, has evolved in concept, definition, and practice.",
    "While multiple definitions now exist, it is generally agreed upon that the exposome represents the totality of exposures experienced by an individual (human or other), and that these exposures reflect exogenous and endogenous stressors originating from chemical and non-chemical sources [23, 24].",
    "By definition, chemical components of the exposome are measureable in media with which a receptor comes into these media include--but are not contact. For humans, limited to--food, air, water, consumer products (e.g., lotions), articles (e.g., clothing), house dust, and building materials. Biological media further offer a window into the exposome, and have been a focus of many analytical efforts",
    "[25-28]. In most instances, analytical chemistry-based exposome research has moved away from \"targeted\" methods and towards suspect screening analysis (SSA) and non-targeted analysis (NTA) methods.",
    "Suspect screening studies are those in which observed but unknown features (generally defined in HRMS experiments by an accurate mass, reten- tion time [RT], and mass spectrum) are compared against a database of chemical suspects to identify plausible hits [21, 29]. True NTA (also called \"untargeted\") studies are those in which chemical structures of unknown compounds are postulated without the aid of suspect lists [21, 29].",
    "While clear differences exist in the methods used for SSA and NTA, the term \"non-targeted analysis\" is commonly used to describe both SSA and NTA experiments. As such, the abbreviation \"NTA\" is used here in a general sense to describe this entire genre of research.",
    "Within this NTA realm, emphasis is generally placed on characterizing compounds that are unknown or poorly studied, and, more importantly, on examining compounds that are significantly related to an exposure source (environmental forensics), health status, or some other measure of interest. NTA stu- dies are gaining in popularity [30], but the rapid and accurate characterization of large suites of chemical unknowns remains challenging.",
    "Appropriate resources and therefore be identified to propel efficient methods must NTA methods away from a niche field and into mainstream public health laboratories. EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) has pioneered many HTS strategies for toxicity testing, expo- sure forecasting, and risk-based prioritization over the past decade. In support of these efforts, EPA's ToxCast project, administered within the National Center for Computational Toxicology (NCCT), has procured and manages a rich library of individual chemicals [5]. NCCT further develops, curates, and manages databases and dashboards that house information on these and many other compounds of rele- vance to environmental health.",
    "Whereas these collective tools are the basis for EPA's HTS activities (designed to potentially inform regulatory decisions), they have seldom been considered as resources for the exposomics research community, and remain underutilized in NTA experiments. In a recent article [31], we demonstrated the power of ORD resources for guiding novel NTA workflows.",
    "Our pilot- scale study showed that ORD tools can be effectively used to identify, prioritize, and confirm novel compounds in samples of house dust. It further indicated that certain novel compounds (i.e., those never before measured in house dust) are ubiquitous environmental contaminants and likely to activate specific biological pathways. Additional studies have reported similar findings based on analyses of house dust and other media",
    "[32-34]. Together, these studies underscore a limited understanding of the compounds pre- sent in our environments.",
    "Yet, they also highlight a need for, and clear advantage of, integrating NTA research efforts with those already established to support risk-based chemical prioritization. The purpose of this article is to provide a clear road mapfor integrating NTA research with current chemical screening initiatives. The article first discusses NTA meth- ods as tools for discovering the exposome.",
    "It then provides a brief history and synopsis of current activities within ORD, with specific emphasis on activities that relate to NTA research. A summary of an EPA-led collaborative trial is then presented, which exploits ORD resources to advance Tools for non-targeted analysis research and chemical safety NTA research efforts.",
    "A multi-step framework is finally offered, which is being used by EPA scientists to maximize data used in, and knowledge gained from, NTA experi- ments. The information provided herein will enable NTA practitioners to make greater use of valuable resources that testing programs. It will service 21st century chemical further allow scientists and decision makers to make direct use of NTA data when performing risk-based chemical prioritizations.",
    "Together these actions will enable more efficient, comprehensive, and relevant evaluations of che- mical safety. Methods, results, and discussion NTA as a tool for exposome research The concept of the exposome has been in existence for more than a decade. During this period, a number of modified definitions have been proposed to place emphasis on: 1) external vs. internal exposure sources (e.g., the \"eco-expo- some\" [8] and the \"endogenous exposome\" [35]); 2) research applications for specific media (e.g., the \"blood exposome\" [24, 36] and the \"tooth exposome\" [37]); and 3) general analytical strategies (e.g., \"top-down exposomics\" vs. \"bot- tom-up exposomics\"",
    "[23, 38]). Regardless of the definition and application, it is generally agreed that NTA methods are a key to discovering the breadth of all exposures, and more importantly, which exposures are associated with disease.",
    "Different portions of the exposome have now been char- acterized using suites of analytical tools, which range from low resolution gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/ MS) platforms, to ultra-high resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR/MS) platforms. Many recent investigations have focused on polar organic compounds, which are often readily detected using liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with high time-of-flight mass spectrometry resolution Orbitrap or [28]. Hybrid systems, such as quadrupole- (TOF/MS) Orbitrap spectrometers quadrupole-TOF massand (Q-TOF/MS), further enable compound identification using both precursor ion detection in full-scan MS mode, and product ion detection in MS/MS mode.",
    "These HRMS hybrid systems are quickly becoming the most commonly used tools in NTA laboratories [28]. High-resolution MS instruments generate data on thou- sands of molecular features, which represent unknown compounds generally described in terms of their mono- isotopic masses, retention times, and isotope distributions. In some cases, these data are accompanied by fragmentation spectra (via MS/MS analysis) and predicted molecular for- mulae.",
    "The job of the analyst is to proffer chemical struc- tures that are consistent with these observed features. Current guidance recommends binning structures based upon the certainty of assignment [39].",
    "\"Tentative candi- dates\" are proposed structures that are consistent with experimental data, but not necessarily unequivocal top hits. \"Probable structures\" are those not confirmed with standards but named as top candidates using library spectrum matches and other diagnostic evidence (e.g., RTs associated with a specific method). Finally, \"confirmed structures\" are those that have been verified using a reference standard.",
    "Multiple tentative candidates can exist for a given molecular feature. As such, it is expected that, for a given NTA experiment, the number of compounds within each tentative candidates > bin will be ordered as follows: probable structures > confirmed structures.",
    "Exact ratios across bins vary from lab-to-lab and medium-to-medium based on available resources (e.g., authentic standards), tools (e.g., MS/MS-enabled platforms), and experience/ expertise. Yet, it is clear that the number of unknowns will continue to outweigh the number of knowns for the fore- seeable future.",
    "The goal, then, is to enable knowledge-based ascension, for any feature of interest (e.g., those associated with measures of biological perturbation), from labeling as a to confirmed tentative candidate, compound. to probable structure, The rise from tentative candidate to probable structure is conditional upon the availability of sufficient diagnostic evidence. Probable structures are generally those that have high-scoring library spectrum matches, relatively large numbers of sources or references in public databases, and predicted retention behavior that is consistent with observa- tions about the unknowns [39]. A number of open access tools exist for ranking tentative candidates and naming probable structures (e.g., MetFrag [http://c-ruttkies.github.io/ MetFrag/] and STOFF-IDENT",
    "[https://www.lfu.bayern.de/ stoffident/#!home]. These tools, as well as those available from instrument vendors, often rely on large public databases (e.g., ChemSpider [http://www.chemspider.com/] and Pub- the initial Chem",
    "[https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/]) identification of tentative candidates, and subsequent ranking based on data sources/references. Some tools predict and evaluate retention behavior using logP-based or logD-based models that vary in sophistication [40].",
    "Finally, to enable spectral matching, most tools utilize existing reference spectra, which are available via vendors and open databases (e.g., mzCloud(tm) [https://www.mzcloud.org/], MassBank [http://www.massbank.jp/index.html?lang=en], and MoNA [http://mona.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/]), or theoretical spectra, which are generated from fragmentation prediction tools such as CFM-ID (http://cfmid.wishartlab.com/), MetFrag (http://c- ruttkies.github.io/MetFrag/), and MAGMa",
    "[41].for The combination of these approaches has proven suc- cessful in the characterization of unknowns in a variety of media. Yet, opportunities exist to further enhance these J. R. Sobus et al. tools for future investigations.",
    "For example, there is a growing need extend screening libraries to include not just known parent chemicals, but predicted metabolites and environmental degradants--compounds which are believed to comprise a substantial portion of the exposome [16]. Indeed, as stated in a recent review by Escher and collea- gues \"...a very small number of the thousands of com- pounds detectable in a sample can actually be identified, leaving the largest fraction of chemicals at the level of a known accurate mass (or molecular formula) and retention time. Any improvements here rely strongly on a better assignment of likely structures... based on a prediction of fragmentation, ionization, or chromatographic retention times supported by more comprehensive mass spectra databases\" [10].",
    "From these statements it is clear that significant improvements to NTA workflows are needed, as are appropriate resources (e.g., chemicals on which to training sets) that build reference databases and model can enable these improvements. The following section details projects and resources within ORD that are now being used, by EPA scientists and the broader scientific community, to enhance NTA methods and workflows. Highlights from EPA's Office of Research and Development High throughput bioactivity screening and the ToxCast project In 2007, the National Research Council (NRC) of the National Academies of Science (NAS) published \"Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century\", a report calling for greater focus on mechanistic (i.e., pathway-based) understanding of toxicity",
    "[2]. At that time, the advent of HTS had enabled the pharmaceutical industry to: 1) rapidly screen many hun- dreds or thousands of chemicals; 2) screen against targets having greater relevance to humans; and 3) make specific inferences pertaining to the biological pathways involved with toxicity [42].",
    "In many cases, the potential for bioac- tivity within human or specific ecological species could be targeted using in vitro methods, along with proteins and cells derived from tissues of the species in question. Noting these advancements, and the recommendations of the NRC, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Toxicology Program (NTP), the NIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), and EPA formed the Federal Tox21 consortium, which was soon joined by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).",
    "The goal of this consortium was to use modern HTS approaches to better assess chemical toxicity, especially for many thousands of chemicals for which little or no toxicity data were available [1]. To date, over 8000 chemical substances (including pharmaceuticals, plasticizers, pesticides, fragrances, and food additives) have been tested, robotically and uniformly at the NCATS intramural testing facility, across over 100 HTS assays (consisting of nuclear receptor target assays and cell-based viability assays)",
    "[3]. The EPA-contributed portion of Tox21 includes more than 3800 unique compounds.",
    "Many of these compounds have undergone additional HTS across more than 800 assay endpoints as part of a separate EPA testing program, known as the ToxCast project [4]. This EPA testing program has expanded in tandem with the Tox21 program, enlisting a number of contract-administered, commercially available assay systems, many of which were originally developed to service the pharmaceutical industry's drug discovery pro- grams. ToxCast assay technologies span a broad suite of high and medium-throughput screening targets and cell- based systems, and provide for more extensive biological screening of EPA's ToxCast library, effectively com- plementing the available Tox21 assays. ToxCast testing has been conducted in phases.",
    "The Phase I library included 310 compounds, which were primarily pesticides that have been well characterized by animal toxicity studies, along with small sets of high-priority environmental chemicals (e.g., bisphenol A [BPA]) and toxicologically active metabolites (e.g., mono(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate [MEHP]). Phase II test- ing examined Phase I chemicals across new assays. It fur- ther broadened the chemical library to include more than 700 industrial chemicals, known toxicants and carcinogens, alternative \"green\" chemicals, food-additives, and failed pharmaceuticals. Phase II testing also included ~800 addi- tional limited testing in that underwent endocrine-relevant assays only.",
    "A rolling \"Phase III\" is ongoing with the goals of: 1) broadening assay endpoint coverage across the nearly 1800 compounds in the Phase II library, 2) expanding upon the Phase II library with newly added priority chemicals, and 3) applying strategic testing to the larger EPA Tox21 library [5].",
    "chemicals ToxCast HTS is typically conducted in concentration- response format, with statistical analysis used to estimate the concentration of chemical needed to cause bioactivities in any given assay [4]. Many chemical-assay combinations are inactive at even the highest tested concentration",
    "[43, 44]. Those assays that show systematic response with concentration are referred to as \"hits\", with a portion of assay hits occurring at concentrations below ranges statistically-derived and of cytotoxicity.",
    "A series of biologically-derived models for predicting in vivo effects have been developed using ToxCast HTS hits as predictors, and archival in vivo animal studies as evaluation data. To date, some pathways are better covered than others due to available technologies and EPA priorities (e.g., there are 18 assays that indicate activity related to estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) activation [45]).",
    "ToxCast assay results have Tools for non-targeted analysis research and chemical safety been made publically available by multiple means at regular the conclusion of each testing phase, and at intervals [4]. Most ToxCast and Tox21 assays have focused on parent compound effects [46].",
    "There are two primary reasons for a lack of testing on metabolites, degradants, and transforma- tion products. First, some of these compounds are highly reactive and cannot be effectively assessed until metaboli- cally competent systems are created. Second, sufficient quantities of these compounds are needed to provide to multiple testing facilities-many metabolites, degradants, and transformation products are not available on the market, and have therefore not been tested [5].",
    "An extensive library of thousands of ToxCast chemicals does exist, however, allowing independent laboratories to perform experiments on matched chemical samples [5]. Nominations for new test chemicals are welcomed, with the biggest limitation being the ability to acquire sufficient quantities of the compounds of interest.",
    "We note that while most of the in vitro assays do not have metabolic competency, some assays using primary human hepatocytes or pluripotent liver cells (e.g., HepaRG) do allow the assessment of metabolic effects on the liver [47]. Additional research is ongoing to apply structure- based metabolism prediction methods and to augment other important assays with metabolic competency.",
    "High throughput exposure screening and the ExpoCast project While thousands of chemicals have been profiled for bioactivity using HTS, many of these chemicals are lacking data on exposure [48], which hinders risk-based evaluation. Many more chemicals exist without exposure or bioactivity data, and are in need of \"exposure-based prioritization\" prior to HTS and risk assessment",
    "[49]. The EPA's exposure forecaster (ExpoCast) project was therefore developed to generate the data, tools, and evaluation methods required to produce rapid and scientifically-defensible estimates of exposure [11], and to confidently relate these estimates to concentrations that exhibit bioactivity (identified via HTS)",
    "[50-52]. Since the inception of ExpoCast, EPA has orga- nized and analyzed extant data; collected new data on chemical properties, uses, and occurrence [53, 54]; and evaluated/developed mathematical models for predicting exposures across thousands of compounds [55]. With regards to mathematical modeling, a meet-in-the-middle approach has proven valuable.",
    "Using this approach, forward modeling predictions (e.g., those from mechanistic expo- sure models) have been compared against exposure esti- mates inferred from down-stream monitoring data (e.g., human biomarker measures, which cover only a small fraction of the overall chemicals of interest). Statistical comparisons of forward model predictions vs. biomarker- based estimates allows global examination of model per- formance and the impact of specific modeling assumptions on final exposure predictions [56]. The concepts and stra- tegies for this meet-in-the-middle approach have been described elsewhere and implemented at EPA as part of a Systematic Empirical Evaluation of Models (SEEM) framework [57].",
    "The SEEM framework allows for crude extrapolation from chemicals with monitoring data to chemicals without such data. To date, this approach has relied upon exposures inferred from urinary biomarker data as reported in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).",
    "Notable findings of SEEM work include: 1) fate and transport models-that can predict exposure for thousands of chemicals following industrial releases (i.e., \"far-field\" sources) and migration through the environment [58, 59]-are limited in their ability to describe urinary biomarker data [57]; 2) chemicals present in urine often reflect \"near-field\" sources in the home, such as consumer products and articles of commerce (e.g., furniture and flooring) [57]; and 3) five factors (production volume, use in consumer products, use in industrial processes, use as a pesticidal active, and use as a pesticidal inert) are able to explain roughly half of the chemical-to-chemical variance in median exposure rates inferred from NHANES urine data",
    "[60]. Consistent with these findings, new mechanistic models have been developed with a focus on near-field exposure pathways [61, 62]; the incorporation of predictions from these new models into the SEEM framework has the potential to refine consensus exposure predictions for data- poor chemicals.",
    "In order to parameterize these models, however, information is needed on product formulation-- that is, the concentration of chemicals in a product. Gold- smith and colleagues addressed this need by cataloging thousands of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for products sold by a major U.S. retailer, allowing searches for chemical presence in reviewed products [53].",
    "Dozens of similar product ingredient databases now exist from other sources and were recently aggregated into EPA's Chemical and Product Categories (CPCat) database [54]. Listings within this aggregated database include chemicals declared by the manufacturer or observed through laboratory analy- sis. It is noteworthy that certain formulated products (e.g., personal care products) have specific labeling guidelines that make ingredient information more prevalent, whereas other products (e.g., household cleaning products, and \"durable goods\" such as apparel or furniture) are governed by narrow (or non-existent) chemical reporting require- ments, and therefore have limited formulation data [49].",
    "A challenge in using product ingredient databases for mechanistic exposure modeling is the qualitative nature of J. R. Sobus et al. the formulation data.",
    "Even when chemicals are listed as being present in a product, concentration values are often not provided. National production volume data are available for many chemicals, but typically binned into category ranges that can span an order of magnitude, and not directly linked to specific releases or intended use.",
    "Further, many chemicals determined to be present in urine by NHANES (generally as metabolites) do not even appear on lists of highly produced chemicals, indicating that they are pro- duced at low levels (less than 25,000 lb/year) or do not emanate from monitored production processes. Finally, while some data exist for chemicals deliberately added to objects, many chemicals are introduced to products through packaging, and are therefore present despite not being explicitly labeled [54].",
    "Noting these limitations, machine learning models have been developed at EPA to fill knowledge gaps related to product chemistries. These models utilize physico-chemical properties [63] and/or chemical structure information [64] to predict functional uses for individual compounds.",
    "Functional use estimates are then combined with consumer product ingredient databases (described above) to develop screening-level concentration estimates (\"generic formulations\") for select products. These screening-level estimates are appropriate for some applica- tions (e.g., chemical prioritization), but may not be well- suited for rigorous quantitative analyses.",
    "Additional product composition data are therefore needed to expand coverage across additional products and non-intentional ingredients, and to support the development of exposure predictions fit for higher-tier safety assessments. Based on existing product/product-use information, along with environmental and biological monitoring data, it's clear that chemical exposures often co-occur, leading to the potential for mixture effects on biological systems. To date, limited bioactivity-based HTS has been performed on chemical mixtures, owing, in part, to the vast number of mixtures that could conceivably be tested.",
    "Exposure infor- mation, however, is now being used to address this limita- tion. In particular, knowledge of chemical co-occurrence in media [65] and formulations [54] are being used to reduce the number of permutations considered for HTS.",
    "As an example, in a chemical library of 1000 unique compounds, there are more than 10300 combinations of compounds that could be evaluated using HTS assays. The role of exposure- based priority setting is to identify known or possible (i.e., those that are likely to occur) chemical mixtures that first require screening, and to set aside mixtures that may never occur. A recent ExpoCast analysis demonstrated the value of this approach using existing measures from CDC's NHANES.",
    "Specifically, Kapraun and colleagues considered chemical co-occurrence using urine and blood measures, and ultimately identified a tractable number of chemical combinations that occurred in greater than 30% of the U.S. population [66].",
    "The techniques utilized by Kapraun and colleagues now make it possible to readily evaluate che- micals for potentially hazardous synergies. Yet, analyses to date are beholden to limited datasets of target analytes. As such, broad measurement-based datasets are now required to further examine the extent to which chemical exposures co-occur in a consistent, predictable, and biologically- relevant manner.",
    "The Distributed Structure-Searchable Toxicity (DSSTox) database Data generated from EPA's ToxCast and ExpoCast pro- grams are now stored within EPA's DSSTox database. The original DSSTox web site was launched in 2004, providing a common access point for several thousand environmental chemicals associated with four publicly available toxicity databases pertaining to carcinogenicity, aquatic toxicity, water disinfection by-products, and estrogen-receptor binding activity. This collection of DSSTox data files offered a highly-curated, standardized set of chemical structures that was well-suited for structure-activity mod- eling [67, 68].",
    "The quality of mappings between chemical identifiers (names, registry numbers, etc.) and their corre- sponding structures provided the community with a com- prehensive set of mappings to a unified DSSTox structure index. This structure index became the underpinning of the current DSSTox chemical database. DSSTox continued to expand over the next decade with additional chemical structure files of interest to the tox- icology and environmental science communities, including lists of high-production volume (HPV) chemicals, indexed lists of public microarray experiment databases, FDA drugs, lists (e.g., EPA's Integrated Risk and risk assessment Information System",
    "[https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/iris2/atoz. cfm]). From 2007 onward, the database was enlisted to serve as the cheminformatics backbone of the ToxCast and Tox21 programs, with DSSTox curators registering all chemicals entering both screening libraries [5]. This enabled the mapping of in vitro and in vivo data to chemical structures, the latter through indexing of the NTP bioassay database and EPA's Toxicity Reference Database (Tox- RefDB)",
    "[69]. By mid-2014, the manually curated DSSTox database had grown to over 20,000 chemical substances (spanning more than a dozen inventories) of high priority to EPA research programs (archived DSSTox content avail- able for download at ftp://ftp.epa.gov/dsstoxftp).",
    "Despite the growth of DSSTox from 2007-2014, cov- erage did not extend to larger EPA inventories (e.g., the Toxic Substances Control Act [TSCA] inventory, https:// www.epa.gov/tsca-inventory and the Endocrine Disruption Screening https://www.epa.gov/ endocrine-disruption), which were beginning to define a Program universe, Tools for non-targeted analysis research and chemical safety putative \"chemical exposure landscape\" [48, 70].",
    "The focused nature of DSSTox stemmed from rate-limiting manual curation efforts, which ensured high quality structure-identifier mappings, but limited opportunities for DSSTox to more broadly support EPA research and reg- large chemically-indexed ulatory efforts. A number of databases (such as PubChem, ChemSpider, ChEMBL, ChemIDPlus, and ACToR) eventually provided access points for additional chemical structures and identifiers. Curation efforts, however, demonstrated high rates of inaccuracies and mis-mapped chemical identifiers in these public domain chemical databases (e.g., a name or registry number incorrectly mapped to one or more structures), a common situation that has previously been reported [71, 72].",
    "As such, the decision was ultimately made to expand DSSTox using publicly available resources, while also recognizing the limitations of those resources, and preser- ving the aspects of quality curation upon which DSSTox was built. The product of database expansion efforts, known as DSSTox version 2 (V2), was developed using algorithmic curation techniques, both alone and in support of focused, ongoing manual curation efforts.",
    "A key constraint applied to the construction of DSSTox_V2 was the requirement for a 1:1:1 mapping among the preferred name for a chemical (chosen to be unique), the active (or current) Chemical Abstracts Services Registration Number (CAS-RN), and the chemical structure, as could be uniquely rendered in mol file format. Subject to these constraints (i.e., disallowing con- flicts) chemical structures and uniquely mapped identifiers were sequentially loaded into DSSTox_V2 from the fol- lowing public databases: the EPA Substance Registry Ser- vices (SRS) database (containing the public TSCA chemical inventory, accessed at https://iaspub.epa.gov/sor_internet/ the National Library of Medicine's registry/substreg/); (NLM) ChemIDPlus (part of the TOXNET suite of data- bases, accessed at https://chem.nlm.nih.gov/chemidplus/); and the National Center for Biotechnology Information's (NCBI) PubChem database (the portion containing registry number identifiers along with other chemical identifiers, accessed at https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).",
    "Based on the number of sources that agreed on mappings of identi- fiers to structures, these public data were loaded with a quality control annotation (qc_level) ranging from low to high. Publicly indexed substances containing structures and identifiers that conflicted with existing DSSTox information were not registered; they were either queued for manual curation if considered important to EPA research programs, or were set aside to be loaded at a later date with appropriate documentation of the conflict. In addition to the programmatic incorporation of non- conflicting portions of SRS, ChemIDPlus and PubChem into DSSTox_V2, both manual and programmatically lists, assisted curation has continued to address critical gaps in including coverage of high-interest environmental pesticides, food additives, chemicals of potential concern for endocrine disruption",
    "[73], chemicals with known func- tional use in products [54], and substances on the public EPA hydraulic fracturing chemicals list (https://cfpub.epa. gov/ncea/hfstudy/recordisplay.cfm?deid=332990). With these latest additions, the DSSTox database now has over 750,000 records, with more than 60,000 manually curated or having consistent identifier assignments in three or more public databases constituting the highest qc_level content. The clean mapping of structural identifiers (names, CAS- RN) to chemical structures provides an essential under- pinning to robust and accurate cheminformatics workflows.",
    "Elements of such workflows, designed to support quanti- tative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling as part of EPA's ToxCast and ExpoCast programs, are now being surfaced through EPA's CompTox Chemistry Dashboard. The CompTox Chemistry Dashboard The CompTox Chemistry Dashboard (hereafter, referred to as the \"Dashboard\"), developed at NCCT, is a freely accessible web-based application and data hub.",
    "Chemical substances surfaced via the Dashboard are hosted in the DSSTox database with associated identifiers (e.g., CAS- RN, systematic and trivial names). The Dashboard is used to search DSSTox using a simple alphanumeric text entry box (Fig. 1a).",
    "A successful search will result in a chemical page header (Fig. 1b) that provides: 1. a chemical structure image (with ability to download in mol file format); intrinsic properties monoisotopic mass); (e.g., molecular formula and 3. chemical identifiers (e.g., systematic name, SMILES string, InChI string, and InChIKey); related compounds (based on molecular skeleton search, molecular similarity search, and chemical presence in various mixtures and salt forms); 5. a listing of databases in which the chemical is present (e.g., ToxCast and Tox21); and 6. a record citation including a unique DSSTox substance identifier (DTXSID).",

The \"Chemical Properties\" and \"Environmental Fate and Transport\" tabs contain experimental properties assembled from various sources; presented values reflect recent efforts of NCCT to curate specific datasets in support of prediction algorithms",

The \"Toxicity\" values tab includes data gathered from multiple EPA databases and documents, and various online open data sources. The \"Literature\" tab allows a user to choose from a series of queries, and perform searches against Google Scholar and Pubmed.",
    "It further integrates PubChem widgets for articles and patents. In general, all tabular data surfaced on the Dashboard can be downloaded as either tab-separated value files or Excel files, or included into an SDF file with the chemical structure.",

    "Summary of EPA's NTA workshop and collaborative trial In August 2015, ORD's National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL) and Chemical Safety for Sustainability (CSS) research program jointly hosted an NTA-focused workshop in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. The purpose of the workshop was to bring together world experts in exposure science, toxicology, cheminformatics, and analytical chemistry to discuss opportunities for colla- boration and research integration.",
    "Invited presentations focused on research and regulatory drivers; existing data, tools, and resources that are being used to support HTS programs (as described in the previous sections); and NTA methods that are being developed and applied to char- acterize the exposome. Presentations from EPA science leaders called for engagement among research communities and highlighted how individual groups stand to benefit from shared knowledge and resources.",
    "Needs of the exposure scientists (representing the ExpoCast project), toxicologists (representing the ToxCast project), and analytical chemists (representing NTA projects) were articulated during the workshop as follows: Needs of exposure scientists (ExpoCast) to support HT exposure screening: - Measurements of chemicals in consumer products and articles of commerce - Measurements of chemicals in environmental/residential media - Measurements of chemicals in biological media Needs of toxicologists (ToxCast) to support HT bioactivity screening: - Prioritized lists of candidate parent (registered) chemicals - Prioritized lists of candidate degradants/metabolites - Prioritized lists of candidate chemical mixtures Needs of analytical chemists (NTA) to support exposome research: - Large, relevant, curated, and open chemical databases- for compound identification Informatics tools for candidate selection and prioritiza- tion - Large inventories of chemical standards and reference spectra for candidate confirmation - Laboratory networks to support comprehensive analyses and standardized methods The needs of the exposure scientists reflect the general lack of measurement data that are required to parameterize and ultimately evaluate exposure models. The needs of the toxicology community reflect the challenge of utilizing HTS methods to characterize bioactivity across tens-of-thousands of known compounds, and many more possible degradants, metabolites, and mixtures. Finally, the needs of the analy- tical chemistry community reflect the resources that are required for a holistic examination of the exposome.",
    "Two days of discussion on these needs led to the plan- ning and development of a research collaboration that will benefit all invested parties. A primary goal of the research collaboration is to answer the following questions: 1. How can resources procured for HTS research in support of chemical safety evaluations be used to advance NTA methods? 2. How can measurement data generated from NTA methods be used to direct HTS research and strengthen chemical safety evaluations? EPA's Non-Targeted Analysis Collaborative Trial (ENTACT) was developed in direct response to these questions.",
    "ENTACT makes full use of EPA's ToxCast library of approximately 4000 compounds, is designed to be conducted in three parts, and involves international participants spanning more than 25 government, academic, and private/vendor laboratories. For part I of ENTACT, approximately 1200 compounds from the ToxCast library were combined into a series of synthetic mixtures, with ~100 to ~400 compounds included in each mixture. Laboratories participating in ENTACT will perform blinded these mixtures using their state-of-the art analyses of NTA methods.",
    "Individual methods will span a variety of separation and detection techniques, instruments, software, databases, and workflows. Results will be compiled by EPA and used to determine which NTA tools are best suited for the detection of specific compounds or groups of com- pounds.",
    "They will further indicate the extent to which sample complexity affects NTA method performance. Finally, they will serve as the basis for future QSAR models that predict the likelihood of a given compound being detected by a selected analytical method.",
    "Part I of ENTACT evaluates NTA method performance using samples of fully synthetic mixtures. Part II, on the other hand, evaluates NTA method performance using extracts of true environmental and biological samples.",
    "Here, extracts of reference material house dust (National Institute of Standards and Technology [NIST] Standard Reference Material [SRM] 2585), human serum (NIST SRM 1957), and silicone passive air samplers were shared across laboratories to determine the region of chemical space that can be characterized using specific NTA methods, by sample type. To explore the extent to which the matrices affect extraction and other method performance parameters, each sample has also been fortified with a mixture of Tools for non-targeted analysis research and chemical safety Fig.",
    "3 A framework for integrating NTA methods and data with HTS tools (ToxCast, ExpoCast, and the CompTox Chemistry Dashboard [with the underlying DSSTox database]) available from EPA's Office of Research and Development ToxCast chemicals prior to extraction.",
    "As such, laboratories participating in ENTACT have received two extracts of each medium--one based on a fortified reference sample and one based on an unaltered reference sample. Results of part II analyses will identify the most suitable methods for characterizing specific chemicals within a given medium. Perhaps more importantly, they will indicate how compre- hensively a concerted effort of top laboratories can char- acterize compounds within house dust, human serum, and passive air samplers.",
    "Parts I and II of ENTACT have been open to all inter- ested laboratories, resources permitting. Part III, however, has been open only to instrument vendors, and select institutions that manage large open databases/software in support of NTA workflows.",
    "For part III, the full ToxCast chemical library, totaling ~4000 unique substances, is being shared for the purpose of generating reference mass spectra across a variety of instruments and analytical conditions (e.g., ionization source, ionization mode, collision energy, MS level). Institutions receiving these compounds will generate individual spectral records and make them avail- able to EPA for further public use. Institutions may also make spectral records available to the public, or their cus- tomers, via addition to existing databases or development of compound libraries.",
    "Collectively, these efforts will enable users of many MS and HRMS platforms to rapidly screen for the presence of ToxCast chemicals in samples of their choosing. Results from these screening-level analyses will then provide provisional measurement data (e.g., presence/ absence in a given medium) across thousands of compounds for which exposure data are currently lacking. These data will ultimately allow an improved understanding of aggre- gate exposures (i.e., one compound, multiple exposure pathways), cumulative exposures (i.e., multiple compounds, multiple exposure pathways, one biological target), and the contribution of ToxCast chemicals to the exposome. Framework for research integration A formalized framework is needed to ensure maximum benefit of ENTACT to both exposome and chemical screening research programs. The primary function of the framework, as shown in Fig. 3, is to highlight how and where existing chemical screening tools (i.e., ToxCast, ExpoCast, DSSTox, and the CompTox Chemistry Dash- board) can be leveraged to enhance NTA efforts, and ways in which NTA data can allow for more informed chemical screening.",
    "Sample analysis The first step within the framework is the physical analysis of products/articles, samples, and/or biological samples using NTA methods (Fig. 3). environmental J. R. Sobus et al. Irrespective of the medium in question, no single analysis method, no matter how refined, is able to characterize the full chemical contents of a given sample. The use of mul- tiple methods and analytical platforms, however, can greatly extend surveillance capabilities.",
    "A goal of ENTACT is to determine the chemical space applicability domain for a given method. Trial results will inform the breadth of approaches required to adequately characterize a given medium, or to address a given research, public health, or regulatory need.",
    "For example, trial results will indicate the number and types of methods required to screen for all ToxCast chemicals in a suite of consumer products. Trial results will also identify compounds that have yet to be considered as part of ToxCast/Tox21 but are present in select environmental and biological media.",
    "As described in detail below, latter steps of the framework determine which of these compounds, if any, should be prioritized for bioactivity screening. Candidate identification and evaluation therefore Within ORD, the CompTox Chemistry Dashboard, and the underlying DSSTox database, are primary NTA tools for candidate identification and evaluation (Fig. 3).",
    "Initial work has determined that the Dashboard can effectively identify \"known unknowns\" in samples using data source ranking techniques as developed by Little et al [76]. Here,the Dashboard is used to search unidentified features from HRMS experiments within a mass range, or by an exact formula, and the most likely candidate chemicals are those with the highest data source counts [77].",
    "Data source ranking alone, however, does not provide sufficient evi- dence for a \"probable\" compound classification [39]. The incorporating additional data Dashboard is streams, models, and functionality to increase certainty when assigning structures to unknown compounds. For example, chemical functional use data from EPA's CPCat database are now available through the Dashboard and can be incorporated into workflows to filter lists of tentative structures.",
    "A new and enhanced version of CPCat,the Consumer Products Database (CPDat), has been developed, made available as a beta release in the March, 2017 update to the Dashboard, and further provides predicted functional uses for chemicals with no known use data. This informa- tion can help determine the likelihood that a given com- pound would be present in a given sample (e.g., a textile dye is more likely than a drug to be found in house dust) [77]. In addition, physicochemical properties of candidate chemicals are available within the Dashboard, and can be the likelihood of environmental media used to predict occurrence, and the suitability of a selected laboratory method (e.g., extraction solvent, separation technique, ionization mode) for detection.",
    "The utilization of relevant data streams within the Dashboard can improve the confidence in structural assignments, but a true one-pass analysis requires the ability to search large lists of unidentified features exported from an HRMS instrument. Batch search capability within the Dashboard (Fig. 2b) now enables users to search thousands of instrument generated molecular formulae at once and receive back the top ten most likely candidate chemicals with associated chemical data (e.g., identifiers, properties, structures, etc.).",
    "A further enhancement to this search cap- ability is the inclusion of \"MS-ready\" structures, whereby all chemicals within the database have been desalted, des- olvated, and had stereochemistry removed to represent the forms of chemicals observed via HRMS. In addition to this feature, and the aforementioned features for data source ranking and functional use filtering, spectral matching capabilities will eventually provide supporting evidence for compound identification. Specifically, linking Dashboard records to those from open spectral libraries (e.g., Mass- Bank and MoNa) and fragmentation prediction resources (e.g., MetFrag and CFM-ID) will allow for further con- fidence in probable identifications.",
    "Finally, incorporation of empirical reference spectra from vendors participating in ENTACT will allow rapid screening for a large suite of ToxCast compounds. Candidate prioritization Once probable structures have been proposed, chemical standards are used for feature confirmation, and in some cases, quantitation. As additional standards become avail- able, incremental advances are to be expected in the per- centages of probable and confirmed structures relative to tentative candidates. By definition, however, the ability to confirm compounds will always be limited by the avail- ability of chemical standards.",
    "This limitation is likely to persist given the cost and time associated with standard synthesis. As such, focus must be given to tools for prior- itizing tentative candidates that require further study.",
    "In other words, methods should be employed that help deter- mine which tentative compounds require further study, and which are potentially of little health consequence. In a previous pilot study [31], we identified molecular features in house dust samples using LC-TOF HRMS, proposed tentative candidates by screening observed molecular features against the DSSTox database (which included, at the time, ~33 K compounds), and prioritized tentative candidates for further analysis using data from ToxCast and ExpoCast [31].",
    "Priority candidates - those predicted to have high bioactivity, exposure potential, or both - were examined to identify which candidates could be further classified as probable structures. ToxCast standards were ultimately used to confirm a manageable list of Tools for non-targeted analysis research and chemical safety the confirmed chemicals, compounds. About half of according to a review of the published literature, had never before been measured in house dust.",
    "This pilot study paved the way for a number of NTA studies now being conducted by EPA/ORD, and serves as the basis for the framework proposed here. It was further featured in the recent NRC \"Using 21st Century Science to Improve Risk- report Related Evaluations\" as an example of an \"...innovative approach for identifying and setting priorities among che- micals for additional exposure assessment, hazard testing, and risk assessment that complements the current hazard- oriented paradigm\" [9]for ToxCast and ExpoCast data exist thousands of DSSTox chemicals, and are freely available to the public via the Dashboard. The Dashboard can therefore be used to identify tentative candidates (via formula or mass-based searching), and then sort these candidates based on potential for human (or ecological) contact and biological response.",
    "Figure 3 depicts how ToxCast and ExpoCast data were used in our previous dust analysis, and are now integrated into the research framework. As shown in Fig.",
    "3, exposure and bioactivity estimates for tentative candidates are combined into a prioritization algorithm, along with estimates of feature abundance (i.e., average peak intensity across sam- ples) and detection frequency. EPA's Toxicological Prior- itization Index (ToxPi) software is then used to generate graphical displays for each tentative candidate [78].",
    "Here, each pie wedge represents a weighted and normalized value for the selected variable. The scoring algorithm and ToxPi graphical representation are completely customizable--new variables and different weighting schemes can be easily applied.",
    "To date, our internal analyses have given more weight to candidates with elevated detection frequency and evidence of bioactivity. Exposure and bioactivity evaluation While exposure and bioactivity data are available for thousands of chemicals, the majority of DSSTox com- pounds (~ 99%) are without these data. With regards to priority scoring, compounds with data are considered separately from those without data.",
    "A bifurcation of the research workflow is shown in Fig. 3 to depict this differ- entiation.",
    "Here, compounds with data are shown to undergo a series of steps to enable exposure evaluation, whereas compounds without data are further considered as part of a bioactivity evaluation. EPA's HT exposure models and ExpoCast framework make use of and predict environmental and biological limited concentrations of known compounds. Often, data are available as model inputs and for model para- meterization, which can lead to large uncertainties in media concentration or final estimates. Chemical exposure measurements are therefore needed to help parameterize, evaluate, and refine existing models.",
    "A major goal of the proposed research framework is to enable NTA data to meet these needs. Here, the initial focus is on compounds clas- sified as probable structures, and ranked as high-priority using the ToxPi approach. As a first step, to the extent that these compounds are confirmed using resources allow, existing standards - provisional concentrations may then be estimated using a variety of techniques [79].",
    "These con- centration estimates are then compared to predictions from HT exposure models. Agreement between predicted and estimated concentrations provide confidence in model per- formance.",
    "Sizable disparities between model predicted andre- laboratory estimated values, however, may prompt evaluation of model structures and parameters, and/or follow-up laboratory analyses. Specifically, targeted meth- ods may be developed and applied in instances where NTA- estimated concentrations significantly exceed model pre- dicted values and encroach on exposure thresholds that are consistent with predicted biological activity. The final pro- duct of these steps is strengthened assessments of potential risk for confirmed high-priority compounds.",
    "As DSSTox increases in size, so does the number of probable structures for which exposure and bioactivity data are unavailable. For a given experiment, it is not uncommon to have ten times as many probable structures without exposure and bioactivity data than probable structures with this data.",
    "It is critical that these compounds are not dis- regarded from further analysis based on existing data lim- these compounds must pass a cursory itations. Rather, evaluation for bioactivity before being exempted from further consideration.",
    "QSAR modeling has been applied to deter- mine which compounds are most likely to be bioactive, and the Collaborative therefore higher priority. For example, Estrogen Receptor Activity Prediction Project recently pre- dicted ER activity across a set over 32,000 chemical struc- tures",
    "[73]. Using these predictions, candidate compounds can be prioritized, and attempts made at confirmation using standards and/or additional targeted analysis procedures. Confirmed high-priority compounds are eventually nomi- nated for in vitro screening through the ToxCast program. Results of the ToxCast assays, as well as any new ExpoCast predictions, are ultimately collated within the DSSTox database and Chemistry Dashboard, and used to support Agency prioritization efforts and eventual decisions.",
    "Conclusions and outlook Studies at EPA are now being planned and executed with this integrated research framework in mind. Analyses as part of ENTACT are underway (as of January 2017) and will be a source of measurement data for thousands of J. R. Sobus et al.",
    "ToxCast compounds, and chemicals, degradants, metabo- lites, and mixtures not currently considered by ToxCast/ Tox21. The content of DSSTox and the functionality of the Dashboard are constantly expanding, including the addition of chemical datasets provided by other parties interested in NTA, thereby allowing better access to chemistry data and tools for supporting cheminformatics applications and NTA workflows.",
    "Also expanding are the exposure and bioactivity data being generated by the ExpoCast and ToxCast projects, respectively. Semi-quantitative NTA measures across a variety of media will soon enable evaluation and refinement of ExpoCast predictions. When examined using bioactivity prediction models, these NTA measures will further yield prioritized lists of compounds that can be considered for ToxCast screening.",
    "It is worth noting that measurement data from NTA studies will not parallel those from targeted studies in terms of accuracy and precision. The NTA community will surely face challenges when comparing semi-quantitative data over time, and across analytical platforms and labs. Stan- dardized approaches will therefore be needed to ensure the appropriate generation, communication, and use of NTA measurement data. Numeric results from ENTACT are expected to shed light on the severity of this issue (i.e., the amount of variability in semi-quantitative measures from one experiment to the next) and act as a large training set for future concentration prediction models.",
    "Ultimately, NTA data are intended to be fit-for-purpose--that is, to support screening-level activities. Targeted measures will always be the benchmark for risk-based decisions and actions, and therefore must be generated in tandem, as needed, with NTA measures (Fig. 3). Such a combined measurement scheme will provide a solid foundation for 21st century chemical safety evaluations, and an improved under- standing of the chemical composition of the exposome.",

    "Significant investments are made for the purchase, maintenance and repair of medical equipment. Inadequate management of these equipment will result in financial losses and deprive the public of the intended benefits. This analysis is based on the conceptual framework drawn from the WHO recommended- lifecycle of medical equipment.",
    "AIMS: (1) To identify the problems in different stages of the life cycle.",
    "(2) To assess its financial implications and effect on service delivery. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Analysis of secondary data from the latest Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) Reports for the states in India.",
    "The study variables were category of equipment, financial implications and problems in the stages of life cycle. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Calculation of proportions. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS:",
    "A total of forty instances mentioning problems in the first phase of the life cycle of medical equipment were noted in 12 state reports. The equipment from the radiology department (15), equipment in the wards (5), laboratory (3) and operation theatres (4) were the ones most frequently implicated.",
    "In a majority of cases the financial implications amounted to twenty-five lakhs. The financial implications were in the form of extra expenditure, unfruitful expenditure or locking of funds.",
    "In 25 cases the equipment could not be put to use because of non- availability of trained staff and inadequate infrastructural support. Careful procurement, incoming inspection, successful installation and synchronization of qualified trained staff and infrastructural support will ensure timely onset of use of the equipment. KEY WORDS: Medical Equipment, lifecycle, utilization INTRODUCTION Equipment is an integral part of the physical infrastructure of a health setup.",
    "It is an impor tant means of providing various diagnostic and therapeutic services to the people.

    "The additional collateral benefits achieved are it avoids unnecessary referrals, provides an opportunity to learn and train the students in the medical colleges and makes research possible. technical equipment The purchase, maintenance and repair of the medical equipment amounts to a large investment of funds. The role of the sophisticated for diagnosis and management of diseases is also rising by the day.",
    "In addition, the various external-aided programs and health system development projects have also resulted in the purchase of sophisticated equipment in large numbers. A few studies have pointed out the sub-optimal availability and utilization of equipment in the government health centers and hospitals. The ICMR survey of 1991 has reported that the availability of essential instruments was not adequate in many subcentres and the PHCs (Primary Health Centers).[1] The RCH facility survey in 1999 noted that in India, 89% of the district hospitals, 49% of the CHCs (Community Health Centers) and 56% of the PHCs have at least 60% of the required medical equipment with regional variations.[2] Conceptual framework The World health Organization has described the life cycle of the medical equipment.[3]",
    "The life cycle approach has been recommenced for a comprehensive and more effective management of the medical equipment. It is impor tant to manage each stage in the lifecycle for better results. The conceptual framework for this study is based on this life cycle approach.",
    "The life cycle of the medical equipment is divided into two phases. Phase I: Till the equipment is put into use. Phase II: After the equipment is put into use.",
    "Each of these stages is further divided into different stages (Figure 1). This study assesses some of the problems in the different stages of Phase I in this lifecycle.",
    "MATERIALS AND METHODS The latest Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) reports available for the states in India by July 2004 were reviewed carefully. The reports mentioning problems in the different stages of Phase I of the life cycle were included in the study.",

    "The statistical analysis was done using proportions. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India examines various aspects of government expenditure in different sectors and undertakings. These aspects include: Audit provision of funds, Audit against rules and regulations, Audit of sanctions to expenditure, Propriety audit and efficiency cum performance audit.",
    "Audit boards are constituted for conducting comprehensive audits. These boards associate with them experts in the relevant disciplines, discuss their findings with the institutional authorities, controlling ministries and respective departments to ascertain their findings.",
    "The results of such comprehensive appraisals are incorporated by the CAG in his reports. RESULTS A total of 27 reports were reviewed. Of these, one was a report for the year 1999,seven were for the year 2001 and 19 were reports for the year 2002.

    "Problems were noted with the cobalt therapy units in the radiotherapy department. The suppor tive equipment included steam sterilizers, incinerator and steam laundries. The or thopedic implants, imaging films, subcentre instruments and ophthalmic equipment were included in the others category.",
    "In four instances only mention of hospital equipment was made without further specification. The category of equipment according to the department/section in which it is used is given in Table 1.",
    "A majority of the equipment is from the radiology department, which includes diagnostic imaging equipment like X-rays, CT Scan, USG and Cardiovascular sector scanner. In one report 15 PHCs were reported to have idle X-ray machines.",
    "In 21 cases the equipment was purchased for Medical colleges, seven for public hospitals, eleven for PHCs and one was for subcentre. The main problems identified in the early part of the life cycle were in purchase, non- availability of trained staff and problems during installation.

    "tenders, not Problems were also noted in other phases of the life cycle. (Table 2) In one instance defective X-Ray unit was purchased because of improper incoming inspection.",
    "In one case there was no centralized store inventory. Direct allotment was made to different depar tments. This resulted into non- projection of the year-wise procurement, issues and balances lying unutilized in the store.",
    "A shortage of Imaging films in the MRI/ CT Scan unit worth 8.06 lakhs indicated the possibility of pilferage of scanning facilities in the hospital. In another case the equipment purchased for the emergency wards were Even after the purchase of the equipment like radiotherapy units, CT Scans, X-ray machines could not be installed for want of space, rooms or three phase electric connections. In 15 cases the equipment could not be put to use because of non-availability of qualified staff.",
    "This included non- appointment as well as non-creation of the required posts. In one instance, orthopedic implants could not be used, as there was no framed policy for its use.",
    "An auto-analyzer could not be put to use for lack of accessories. The category wise problems in the life-cycle of different medical equipment (Figure 2) shows that in case of the equipment used in the radiology department non-availability of qualified staff, mainly radiographers and lack of infrastructure in the form of buildings, dark rooms and three phase electric connection were responsible for sub optimal utilization of the X-ray units, CT Scans and USGs.

    "The problems in the purchase were seen for equipment in the wards, supportive equipment and unspecified hospital equipment. The implications of these problems were that in 25 instances the equipment could not be put to use and the public was deprived of the intended services (Table 3).",
    "The average period for which such equipment was lying idle was 3.91 years with a range of one and half years to fourteen years. In five instances the equipment was not purchased inspite of either paying the money of provision of funds from the government. In six cases in which the equipment was being used, there were only financial implications.",
    "Two instances of sub- optimal utilization of the equipment were noted. The non-procurement of C arm table along with the imaging system could not ensure its optimal utilization.",
    "The high level of humidity at the equipment site caused Table 3: Utilization of the equipment In nearly 50% of the instances up to Rupees 25 lakhs of funds were involved. In 17.5% cases the amount was more than one crore (Table 4). It is not only the purchase of major equipment that is costly but the bulk purchase of smaller instruments also leads to significant financial inputs e.g. the unauthorized diversion of funds for purchase of labor tables and drip stands amounted to Rupees 46 lakhs.",

    "The money/funds are released but there is delay in the purchase, installation and use of the equipment. The money is withdrawn in advance without requirement.",
    "There is purchase of equipment without requirement. This study reiterates the huge investments made by the government on medical equipment. The equipment in the radiology department, operation theatres, special wards (ICCU, NICCU) and laboratory needs to be monitored more strictly.",
    "The mismatches in procurement of equipment and available trained staff, adequate infrastructure in the form of building, electricity etc prove to be major hindrances in the timely utilization of the costly equipment. The problems in purchase of the equipment cause financial losses as well as deprive the public of the intended services.",
    "follow The administrators should the procedures for procurement strictly. Many of the sophisticated electrical and electronic equipment are highly sensitive and require specific environmental suppor t.",
    "The procurement of equipment, availability of trained staff and adequate infrastructure should be synchronized with respect to time. The trained staff can be recruited or the available staff can be trained.",
    "Each stage in the life cycle should be monitored carefully. The study by the program evaluation organization, planning commission has described the mismatches between staff, equipment and infrastructural support and its effect on the suboptimal utilization of the equipment.[4] Another study has noted the idle capacity in government hospitals. The ECG, X- ray units, Operation theatres, USG, vehicles were found to be idle for a period ranging from 2 to 25 years.[5] Another study has described the under-utilization of X-rays due to the non- availability of Surgeons in rural hospitals.[6] WHO has prescribed various criteria to be fulfilled before any technical equipment is purchased or accepted as a gift. [7] Some innovative methods have been tried to improve the purchase and utilization of medical equipment.",
    "The Tamil Nadu Medical Supply Corporation, an autonomous organization was established to supply drugs to all government facilities. [8] There was a significant improvement in quality, more efficient use of drugs and lower purchase rates.",
    "Its role was broadened to include medical supplies and medical equipment. The problems and the points to be considered at each stage are summarized in Table 5.",

    "30vi Executive Summary The purpose of this study was to examine a set of user acceptance criteria for autonomous biological detection systems for application in high-traffic, public facilities. The test case for the acceptance criteria was the Autonomous Pathogen Detection System (APDS) operating in high- traffic facilities in New York City (NYC).",
    "The goals of this document are * To serve as informal guidance for users in considering the benefits and costs of these systems. *",
    "To serve as informal guidance for developers in understanding the needs of users. Acceptance criteria were assessed as a function of two major categories of parameters: performance criteria and readiness criteria. Performance criteria include technical items such as types of biothreat agents, numbers of agents, speed to reach an actionable result, and instrument sensitivity, as well as operational items such as cost and mean time between failures. Readiness criteria include factors such as system maturity, the supply chain, and funding.",
    "A particular biological detection system will not be usable until readiness criteria are met. The performance measures can be viewed as contributing to cost or benefit for an autonomous biological detection system in the following manner: The benefit of the system is detection of biological threat agents of interest at levels and on timescales that enable effective public-health response to reduce deaths, illness, and exposure. The cost of the system is up-front acquisition and operating cost to the sponsor plus indirect cost to local authorities arising from impacts on operations.",
    "Linking performance parameters closely to cost and benefit categories results in an unusual ordering of the parameters, but all of the standard parameters should be represented here in some form. In some cases where the parameter could fit in more than one place, the best fit was chosen.",
    "The document needs to be taken as a whole. In follow-up work, this framework will be used to systematically document the APDS for appropriateness and readiness for use in NYC. The review panel had some overall recommendations that go beyond the acceptance criteria themselves: *",
    "The overall prevention-detection-response-restoration system should be laid out so the individual elements (such as a biological detector) can be understood or specified in context. This systems layout could then be used for a systems cost/benefit analysis.",
    "* Threat scenarios should be specified and translated into quantitative technical requirements.",
    "* Current capabilities should be specified and translated into quantitative technical requirements. *",
    "The detailed technical requirements noted above from the threat scenarios and the current capabilities should be compared. *",
    "These criteria and this sort of effort need to be coordinated with BioWatch guidance documents and with Public Health Actionable Assays effort. 341872-1020100.doc page 7 of 30 Introduction 1.1.",
    "Purpose of the Study The purpose of this study was to examine a set of user acceptance criteria for autonomous biological detection systems for application in high-traffic, public facilities. The test case for the acceptance criteria was the Autonomous Pathogen Detection System (APDS) operating in high- traffic facilities in New York City (NYC).",
    "However, the acceptance criteria were designed to be generally applicable to other biological detection systems in other locations. For such detection systems, \"users\" will include local authorities (e.g., facility operators, public health officials, and law enforcement personnel) and national authorities [including personnel from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the BioWatch Program, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)].",
    "The panel members brought expertise from a broad range of backgrounds to complete this picture. The goals of this document are 1.",
    "To serve as informal guidance for users in considering the benefits and costs of these systems. 2. To serve as informal guidance for developers in understanding the needs of users.",
    "In follow-up work, this framework will be used to systematically document the APDS for appropriateness and readiness for use in NYC. 1.2. Review Panel Recommendations The review panel had some overall recommendations that go beyond the acceptance criteria: *",
    "These criteria and this sort of effort need to be coordinated with BioWatch guidance documents and with Public Health Actionable Assays effort. 1.3. Concept of Operations These acceptance criteria for autonomous biological detection systems are defined in the context of the following concept of operations (ConOps): Autonomous biological detectors are assumed to be unmanned, field-deployed instruments that monitor air in high-traffic, public facilities.",
    "The detectors supply biological information to public health officials by text-message alerts and by 341872-1020100.doc page 8 of 30 detailed data feeds, when necessary. Public health officials decide when the instrument signals truly indicate the presence of a biological threat agent and then alert other stakeholders, including facility operators, national public health officials, and law enforcement officials.",
    "Stakeholders respond on the basis of pre- established protocols. Possible responses include closing a facility before manual sampling and follow-up testing are done. The above ConOps is consistent with that developed and in place for the BioWatch Program and follows from discussions carried out among a broad set of New York City agencies on the use of autonomous biological detectors.",
    "1.4. Organization of User Acceptance Criteria Acceptance criteria were assessed as a function of two major categories of parameters: performance criteria and readiness criteria.",
    "Performance criteria include technical items such as types of biothreat agents, numbers of agents, speed to reach an actionable result, and instrument sensitivity, as well as operational items such as cost and mean time between failures. Readiness criteria include factors such as system maturity, the supply chain, and funding.",
    "A particular biological detection system will not be usable until readiness criteria are met. In theory, the ideal solution for developing acceptance criteria would be to vary all of the performance measures to minimize an all-inclusive cost-benefit function. However, in practical terms, identifying performance measures and acceptable values of each for a mission is a good starting point.",
    "The measures can still be viewed as contributing to cost or benefit for an autonomous biological detection system in the following manner: The benefit of the system is detection of biological threat agents of interest at levels and on timescales that enable effective public-health response to reduce deaths, illness, and exposure.",
    "The cost of the system is up-front acquisition and operating cost to the sponsor plus indirect cost to local authorities arising from impacts on operations. The next major section of this report details a set of performance criteria. For each parameter, there is a \"Description\" section followed by a \"Specification and Justification\" section. At this stage the specifications are not complete, but the eventual goal is to set quantitative thresholds (minimum requirements) and goals (desired values).",
    "The following major section details a set of readiness criteria as a checklist of items that should be accomplished before startup. In outline form, the discussion is organized as follows: * Performance - Detect agents of interest - Detect in the required environments - Detect at effective levels - Enable public-health response - Report on an effective timescale - Direct acquisition cost is acceptable to the sponsor - Direct operating cost is acceptable to the sponsor-",
    "Indirect operating cost is acceptable to the local authorities * Readiness - Approved by local agencies - Approved by local/state/federal regulatory agencies 341872-1020100.doc page 9 of 30 - Approved by Public Health Actionable Assays process - SAFETY Act addressed - Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) completed and approved - Acceptance testing completed and approved - Supply chain established - Cost model validated - Funding secured - ConOps approved - Standard Operating Procedures established - Response protocols established - QA/QC protocols established - Training packages developed Infrastructures prepared - The high-level criteria here are either cost or benefit, but there are additional low-level factors that will be practical constraints contributing to the criteria.",
    "341872-1020100.doc page 10 of 30 Performance Criteria As explained in the previous section, the performance measures are organized by benefit (Detect agents of interest, Detect in the required environments, Detect at effective levels, Enable public- health response, and Report on an effective timescale) and cost (Direct acquisition cost is acceptable to the sponsor, Direct operating cost is acceptable to the sponsor, and Indirect operating cost is acceptable to the local authorities).",
    "Each measure has a section for description and a section for specification. 2.1.",
    "Detect Agents of Interest This section requires that the system detect the agents of interest, in terms of both its capability while functioning and that it remains functional in the field. 2.1.1. Agent Types Description Agent types are bacteria, viruses, and toxins (proteins).",
    "Some bacteria of concern form spores in addition to vegetative cells, and both forms are assumed to be included. Specification and Justification",
    "The instrument should be capable of detecting all three agent types for general applicability. 2.1.2.",
    "Agent Panel Description The agent panel is the set of agents targeted for detection in a deployment. Specification and Justification The agent panel will be taken from a DHS/DHHS threat list and must be integrated with the operating BioWatch and LRN system.",
    "This is particularly sensitive information and must be carefully controlled. 2.1.3.",
    "Number of Signatures Description The instrument must be able to correctly and reliably identify multiple agent signatures in a single sample. This can be accomplished by multiplexing (simultaneously identifying multiple signatures) or by serial analysis (running sequential tests for signatures on a sample).",
    "Either way, the results for multiple signatures must be available in the specified time (see Section 2.5.2 Time to Results). The required number of signatures will depend on the number of agents (see Section 2.1.2 Agent Panel) and the signatures per agent needed to get the required breadth and confirmation. Another measure, the desired number of signatures, will include room for additional signatures for better speciation and for emerging threats.",
    "Specification and Justification To be completed later. 341872-1020100.doc page 11 of 30 2.1.4.",
    "Time to Add an Assay Description The time to add an assay to the system is measured from when an agent is isolated to when an assay can be operational on the system. This parameter is a quantitative measure of the upgradeability of the instrument.",
    "Upgradeability provides better protection because additional speciation or emerging threats can be covered. It also delays system obsolescence.",
    "Specification and Justification To be completed later. 2.1.5.",
    "Probability of Detection Description The definition of probability of detection, pd, is the probability that an input exactly at the limit of detection (LOD) will be detected by the system. In this definition, the LOD is not a fixed value but depends on the desired pd. Thus, pd is inseparable from LOD and also quantitatively related to the probability of false positive and often the detection speed (see Section 5.1 ROC curves).",
    "At a given operating condition, increasing input concentrations would normally result in increasing the probabilities of detection. Probability of detection has a value between 0 and 1 and needs to be specified for each agent. The pd also has an associated confidence level depending on the number of experiments performed.",
    "Specification and Justification To be completed later. 2.1.6.",
    "Operational Availability Description Operational availability, AO, represents the fraction of time that a system performs as desired. For a continuously running system, this is approximately the uptime divided by the total time in the field. Although it is often viewed as a maintenance parameter, AO is closely related to pd, in that if the system is not operating, an input will not be detected.",
    "Maintenance and cost implications are addressed in Section 2.7.1 Direct Operating Cost. Operational availability has a value between 0 and 1.",
    "Specification and Justification To be completed later. 2.2.",
    "Detect in the Required Environments The system must perform to its technical requirements in the environments of interest. It is not possible to predict all of the factors that might be relevant in these environments, but some of the main criteria are given below and some of the additional possible factors are listed. 2.2.1.",
    "Environments of Interest Description 341872-1020100.doc page 12 of 30 The environments of interest for the ConOps may serve as general guidance for the developer and will be locations for field testing. Specification and Justification",
    "The current ConOps requires that the system function in indoor environments that are not fully environmentally controlled like subway platforms, commuter rail platforms, passenger concourses, and HVAC equipment rooms. The air of these environments is breathed by 10,000 to 750,000 people per day. 2.2.2.",
    "Temperature Range Description The temperature range brackets the ambient temperatures that could be experienced during a given mission.",
    "Both external effects on equipment and internal effects on an air sample must be considered. Specification and Justification The environments of interest are not fully environmentally controlled, so the temperatures are beyond normal room temperatures.",
    "MTA/Transit has a standard of -10 to 43 oC for their platforms. MTA/MNR suggested 0 to 40 oC. 2.2.3.",
    "Humidity Range Description The humidity range brackets the ambient humidity that could be experienced during a given mission.",
    "Humidity can include water vapor in terms of relative humidity (between 0 and 100 %) and condensed water as mist and rain. Both external effects on equipment and internal effects on the air sample need to be considered. Specification and Justification",
    "The environments of interest are not fully environmentally controlled, so the humidity is beyond normal room range, but there will not be direct rain. MTA/Transit has a standard of 10 to 95 % relative humidity for equipment on their platforms. 2.2.4.",
    "Particle Tolerance Description Particle tolerance specifies the upper limit of particles in the air that the system must be able to handle. The air concentration, expressed as particles/liter of air, should be considered for a given size range of dust particles.",
    "The composition of particles may also be important. Both external effects on equipment and internal effects on the air sample need to be considered.",
    "Specification and Justification Since the target particles are 1 to 10 microns, this will be the range of interest when concentrations are specified, later. 2.2.5.",
    "Battery Capability Description 341872-1020100.doc page 13 of 30 The system must have battery-backup to allow some operation if facility power is lost from either inadvertent or nefarious activities. Specification and Justification The system needs to be able to complete one full analysis panel and transmit the results on battery power.",
    "2.2.6. Additional Factors Description Additional environmental factors are listed here for consideration, but not specified.",
    "* Vibration, particularly in transport. *",
    "Electromagnetic Compatability (EMC), Electromagnetic Interference (EMI), and Electromagnetic Discharge (ESD). *",
    "Liquid and chemical splashes and spills. *",
    "Human interference. 2.3.",
    "Detect at Effective Levels This section requires that the sensitivity be high enough (limit of detection low enough) that the system covers enough space, release scenarios, or people to be of significant benefit.",
    "2.3.1. Sensitivity as Limit-of-Detection Description Sensitivity as limit-of-detection (LOD) is the input signal level that will be detected at a specified probability of detection pd (see also Sections 2.1.5 Probability of Detection and 5.1 ROC curves).",
    "The pd also has an associated confidence level depending on the number of experiments performed. The related parameter of selectivity is also discussed in Section 2.4.3. Several points need to be considered: 1.",
    "A measure of concentration in air should be the basis for sensitivity. Sensitivity in terms of absolute number of particles is not appropriate except to compare techniques using the same collector and sample size. The concentration can be related to a level of threat by considering infectious doses combined with the movements of agents and people in a facility.",
    "2. Strictly speaking, the full time-course of the concentration in air at the analysis point should be specified. It often is not, so there is some arbitrariness.",
    "Instantaneous sensors depend mostly on concentration (e.g., ac , in targets/L air), whereas integrating collectors depend on , in targets*minutes/L air). We use concentration available for collection over time (e.g., the time-integrated definition, limiting the release considered to a collection window (see Section 2.5.1 Sampling Period).",
    "tca 3. The units for targets in the biological materials vary.",
    "Possible units for bacteria include particle, colony-forming-unit (cfu), spore, DNA copy, and agent-containing particle. Full specification of the aerosol composition (live bacteria, dead bacteria, extraneous DNA, extraneous protein, particle agglomeration, particle-size distribution) is usually not given. 341872-1020100.doc page 14 of 30 Similar problems apply to virus and protein units.",
    "Because the bacterial source materials are quantified in cfu/mL, we use that unit for liquid and cfu*minutes/L air for air. Similarly, we will use pfu*minutes/L air for viruses and ng*minutes/L air for toxins. For genomic analysis it may be less ambiguous to use copy*minutes/L air for both bacteria and viruses.",
    "4. The sensitivity (LOD) for most systems is variable and depends on one or more threshold settings, which also affects probability of false positive, pf. Sensitivity also depends on the probability of detection, pd, that is desired.",
    "Thus, pf can be set independently, but LOD requires pd and pf to be specified. 5.",
    "Aerosol releases to directly determine sensitivity cannot be done in the field. Conversely, aerosol chambers do not have representative environmental influences to yield accurate pf, and aerosol release testing is time consuming for determining LOD. It is common to combine field data to determine noise levels and pf, laboratory spike data to determine pd response to known liquid concentrations, and aerosol collector testing to relate the liquid and air concentrations.",
    "6. A common medical definition of sensitivity is the number of true positives divided by the number of actual cases (true positives plus false negatives). The result of such a calculation is a type of probability of detection measured for a set of potentially unquantified inputs, not a sensitivity in terms of biothreat agent levels.",
    "Such an approach is appropriate for a side-by- side probability comparison of two methods on a fixed set. It is not appropriate for technical specification because results will vary depending on the challenges presented to the system. Specification and Justification To be completed later.",
    "2.4. Enable Public Health Response This section concerns the quality of the information made available to the decision-makers.",
    "Some of the parameters that could arguably be in this section (probability of detection, limit of detection, time to results) are addressed in other benefit sections. 2.4.1. Probability of Autonomous False Positives Description A false positive is defined as a positive signal that requires a response when there was actually no agent present.",
    "Both \"rate\" and \"probability\" can be used for false positive. \"False positive rate\" should have units of (false events)/time. \"Probability of false positive\" should have units of (false events)/(total events).",
    "Probabilities are useful because they are independent of numbers of instruments and sampling rate; however, in most cases a user wants to know how often a false alarm will occur (rate of false positives). The related parameter of false negatives is discussed as probability of detection in Section 2.1.5 and also in 5.1 ROC curves. This section specifies the autonomous false positive directly from the instrument, with the ConOps model in mind that biological signals from the instrument will need to be reviewed by a human monitor who makes a decision (\"man-in-the-loop\", see Figure 1 in Section 5.2 Program Execution).",
    "This, then, becomes the probability that the human monitor will need to review the data when there is actually no agent present. 341872-1020100.doc page 15 of 30 Specification and Justification To be completed later. 2.4.2. Probability of Actionable False Positives Description The general description of false positive given above applies here as well, but this section specifies the probability that a false positive makes it through human review.",
    "This becomes the probability that the Biological Action Committee will need act when there is actually no agent present (see Figure 1 in Section 5.2 Program Execution). Specification and Justification To be completed later.",
    "2.4.3. Selectivity Description",
    "The general definition of selectivity is a measure of how well a system can distinguish a target in the presence of near-neighbors. Selectivity can be defined quantitatively in terms of the concentrations of target and of near-neighbor that give the same signal level, resulting in values from 0 to 1 for each target/near-neighbor pair. The near-neighbor must be defined, then the selectivity can be specified or measured based on specified or actual interfering concentration.",
    "Selectivity should be distinguished from specificity, which, strictly defined, is perfect selectivity. Further, a common medical definition of specificity is the number of true negatives divided by the number of actual negatives (true negatives plus false positives). The result of such a calculation is actually a type of probability of not false positive, or 1 - (probability of false positive), not a selectivity in terms of distinguishing a target from a known near-neighbor.",
    "Specification and Justification The specification of selectivity will be part of the Public Health Actionable Assays process. 2.4.4.",
    "Data Accessibility Description Data accessibility states that the data from the instruments are available by remote connection and interpretable by the local public-health employees. They will monitor the data and determine when the biological signals are actionable (see Figure 1 in Section 5.2 Program Execution).",
    "The levels of data accessibility can be defined as \"raw data,\" \"summary data,\" or \"alarm status,\" meaning that those are the finest data resolutions available. Specification and Justification A high data accessibility level of \"raw data\" will be required due to the newness of these systems and the high impact of the monitor's decision.",
    "2.4.5. Remote System Diagnostics Description Remote system diagnostics refers to both assay controls and instrument health signals that assure the instrument is functioning properly.",
    "One example is positive internal controls for the assays to 341872-1020100.doc page 16 of 30 indicate that agent negatives are not false negatives. Another example is air flow rate measurement to indicate that sampling flow paths are not blocked.",
    "The levels of system diagnostics can be defined as \"automated\" (meaning the signals are automatically analyzed and warnings are automatically sent to the monitor), \"manual\" (meaning the signals are available for remote viewing but are not automatically analyzed), or \"unavailable\" (meaning that there is not remote access to complete system diagnostics). Specification and Justification A system diagnostics level of \"automated\" will be required to minimize the frequency and time of monitoring the instruments.",
    "2.4.6. Data Security Description Data security refers to assurance that the data is not monitored or corrupted and that the system operations cannot be influenced through unauthorized access.",
    "Specification and Justification Signals that travel through any public medium (e.g., wireless or internet) must have at least 128- bit encryption. The nodes must be fire-walled to prevent unauthorized access.",
    "2.4.7. Physical Security Description Physical security is assurance that the system cannot be readily disabled by unauthorized personnel.",
    "Specification and Justification To be completed later. 2.4.8.",
    "Biohazard Security Description Biohazard security is assurance that if the system collects hazardous material, it is contained in a manner that does not pose a threat to first responders. Specification and Justification To be completed later. 2.4.9.",
    "Data Time-Stamping Capability Description Time-stamping is the identification of the electronic data with common clock time. This time- stamping must be done to enable situational awareness and event reconstruction.",
    "Specification and Justification The instruments will time-stamp both biological and instrument-health signals and also synchronize their time within one minute of the U.S. Naval Observatory Master Clock in Washington, DC.",
    "341872-1020100.doc page 17 of 30 2.4.10.",
    "Data Archiving Duration Description Some amount of electronic data must be archived on the instrument and archived on networked servers or remote back-ups. The instrument data archiving is required in case of communication losses or for verification purposes. Off-instrument archiving is not addressed here because it is determined by the user's operations and does not affect the instrument.",
    "Specification and Justification The archiving duration on the instrument needs to be at least one month. 2.4.11.",
    "Sample Archiving Capability Description Archived samples from the system can be used for further lab-based testing of true positives or can be used to determine the cause of false positives. The sample integrity and identity must be maintained for forensics and investigations. Specification and Justification Samples identified as potentially positive must be individually archived to avoid dilution and loss of sample temporal identity. Other samples may be pooled but not contaminated by the instrument, for example not combined with assay waste.",
    "2.5. Report on an Effective Timescale One major goal of autonomous biological detection is reporting information on a shorter timescale than manual systems.",
    "This includes the sampling period and the time to results. 2.5.1.",
    "Sampling Period Description The sampling period is the time from start to end of collection and is the inverse of the sampling rate.",
    "Practically, sampling period is also the time resolution, meaning the time period to which an event may be ascribed. Time resolution allows for some identification of when a release occurred, how long a hazardous condition persisted, and who may have been exposed. Due to cost, manual sampling approaches usually operate on 24 hours at low-to-moderate threat conditions.",
    "Autonomous systems are expected to greatly reduce this time. Specification and Justification",
    "The systems should allow a sampling period between 1 and 24 hours. Changes to the sampling period should be possible through automated, semi-automated (remote), and manual control. 2.5.2.",
    "Time to Results Description Time to results is defined as the time from end of collection to when decision-makers have actionable information. Manual sampling approaches with daily pickup typically take about 8 hours for transportation and analysis.",
    "Autonomous systems are expected to greatly reduce this time. The systems will be electronically networked to allow transmission of data nearly 341872-1020100.doc page 18 of 30 instantaneously, but additional time for manual review and communication of results by public health authorities needs to be considered.",
    "Specification and Justification To be completed later. 2.6.",
    "Direct Acquisition Cost is Acceptable to the Sponsor Here, costs are divided into direct and indirect costs, and the direct costs are divided into acquisition and operating costs paid by the sponsor. The sponsor could be a local or federal organization. 2.6.1.",
    "Direct Acquisition Cost Description Direct acquisition cost is paid once by the sponsor to set up the capability. Since the largest component of this cost is likely to be the cost of the autonomous biological detectors themselves, there is reason to express the cost in dollars/instrument, even if this includes other costs and the cost varies with the number of instruments.",
    "The other costs should be itemized and include spare parts, site preparation, installation, training, and documentation. Specification and Justification Acceptable costs are between 25 and 250 k$/instrument, with the number of units deployed depending on this direct acquisition cost point, as well as operating cost and lifespan.",
    "2.7. Direct Operating Cost is Acceptable to the Sponsor The second direct cost is a recurring operating cost paid by the sponsor. 2.7.1.",
    "Direct Operating Cost Description Direct operating cost requires recurring payment for running and maintaining the system. The contributions can include reagents and other consumables, replacement parts, labor of several types, and QA/QC of the operating instruments.",
    "The bottom-line effect of reliability and maintainability parameters like Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) are in direct operating cost here. MTBF and MTTR may also be specified independently as additional constraints if desired.",
    "Similarly, the skill level of maintainers directly affects the cost but may also be specified independently. Specification and Justification To be completed later.",
    "2.8. Indirect Operating Cost is Acceptable to Local Authorities Indirect operating costs are used to represent the impact on the local stakeholders of having the system in their facilities, even if a separate sponsor is paying the direct financial costs.",
    "These costs are usually difficult to quantify, but the contributions can be identified and reasonable ranges can be established. 341872-1020100.doc",

    "At a fixed pd, the LOD increases (sensitivity decreases) if the threshold is adjusted to decrease pf. At a fixed pf, the LOD increases (sensitivity decreases) if larger pd is specified. In medical tests with a given data set, ROC curves are often presented as linear pf versus pd plots with axes from zero to unity.",
    "This representation does not work well for analyzing high-quality tests requiring very low pf, as is required for autonomous biological detection, because the only area of interest is very close to pf = 0. A better display of ROC curve is log(pf) versus LOD for a given pd.",

Indeed, Asians (person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian Subcontinent) are the ethnic group in the U.S. least likely to have a health care visit preceding a suicide attempt [6].",
    "When an at-risk person does seek profes- sional mental health referral or treatment, family and friends frequently play a key role in convincing the person to do so [7]. In Japan too, individuals with suicidal idea- tion are likely to seek advice from close members of their social network [8]. However, even with the best of inten- tions, family, friends, or other members of the community in contact with an individual at risk for suicide are not naturally adept in providing assistance and referral [9].",
    "Training concerned community members so they are equipped to provide direct, specific, and supportive as- sistance to an at-risk individual is a promising approach for which the Institute of Medicine has recommended expansion [10]. While community-based suicide preven- tion interventions have often focused on providing infor- mation and education in a lecture-style format [11], experiential educational components appear more effect- ive (W. F. [12, 13]).",
    "For instance, a randomized con- trolled trial of gatekeeper training for school teachers and parents found that behavioral rehearsal with role play practice resulted in higher total gatekeeper skill scores immediately after training and at follow-up, compared with training as usual lacking the behavioral rehearsal [12]. A number of interventions--often collectively referred to as gatekeeper training programs--have been developed to train frontline individuals, or gatekeepers, in assisting an at-risk person to identify supportive resources. The pro- grams include Mental Health First Aid, Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST), Signs of Suicide (SOS), and Question, Persuade, and Refer (QPR)",
    "[14-17]. QPR consists of a brief standardized role-play exercise and a 1 h didactic training with a short video that tea- ches three gatekeeper skills (ie, questioning, persuading, and referring).",
    "The QPR program has been reviewed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Ad- ministration's (SAMHSA) National Registry of Evidence- based Programs and Practices, and empirical evaluations have shown improvements in suicide-related knowledge and self-efficacy [17-19].",
    "Additionally, the interactive role play exercise has been empirically tested with gains in suicide-specific skills at post-training [20, 21]. Video, or film, may also be an effective educational tool because it engages the individual's senses (eg, visual and auditory), more than print media [22], and it can help shape social norms and health behaviors [23]. A Japanese study found that community residents who watched a publicly-distributed educational video on sui- cide prevention endorsed more awareness of profes- sional mental health referral resources and having a larger network of people available for help-seeking com- pared to non-watching residents [8]. While previous evaluations using QPR and role play have demonstrated gains in knowledge, self-efficacy and gatekeeper specific skill outcomes in before-and-after uncontrolled studies, few studies have utilized more rigorous study designs.",
    "Even less is known about the im- pact of cultural adaptations to high-risk ethnic minority populations. Therefore, the a priori primary aim of this controlled study was to determine if participation in a gatekeeper training intervention including components of QPR, video and active learning, and adapted to target Japanese-Americans and related stake holders popula- tion would increase intended gatekeeper behavior and self-efficacy related to suicide prevention. Our explora- tory aims were to determine if participation would change social norms or include negative experiences for participants. Methods Participants The intervention and control events were free and open to the public.",
    "This study was granted an exemption from ethics approval - by the Institutional Review Board of VA Portland Health Care System - since survey data were collected anonymously. The event targeted Japanese Americans, expatriates and related stakeholders, ie, non- Japanese descent individuals interested in Japanese culture (elsewhere abbreviated as Japanese Americans).",
    "Anyone who voluntarily came to the event was included in the study, and anyone who opted not to complete the survey was excluded. The events were entitled \"Saving 10,000\" and promoted using mailing lists, posters, flyers, and arti- cles in the local press (both English and Japanese print media) by a university center dedicated to Japanese stu- dies. The control was conducted during a single event in English, while the intervention was conducted as two events, once in English and held on a university campus, and once in Japanese and held in a community venue.",
    "The venue in English attracted roughly half Japanese and half non-Japanese participants, while the Japanese venue attracted essentially 100 % Japanese participants. The con- trol was conducted as one event in English and held on a university campus.",
    "Multi-component intervention To help develop our adaptation of the intervention we first conducted pilot testing. The pilot paralleled the current study in three critical ways: first, it targeted the same population (Japanese Americans) as the current study, second, it addressed potentially stigmatizing mental health issues, and, third, tested a three-component inter- vention (didactic lecture, film screening, and question- and-answer session). Results from a pre and post survey Teo et al.",
    "BMC Psychiatry (2016) 16:211 Page 3 of 9 with responses from 115 participants indicated that 90 % intended to get more information about, 48 % to be vigilant for, and 20 % to talk with a health care profes- sional about mental health concerns in themselves or someone they knew [24].",
    "In the present study, we maintained a multi-component format for the intervention. Our intervention, though novel, drew from the literature on gatekeeper training, which can include any combination of multimedia or video presentation, didactic training, or interactive com- ponents including behavioral rehearsal",
    "[14, 19]. The film followed immediately by an screening occurred first, experiential educational session, and finally an interactive question-and-answer session. The film screened was entitled Saving 10,000, a 50-min bilingual (English and Japanese) documentary that provides a thoughtful ex- ploration of the suicide epidemic in Japan",
    "[25]. The interactive training session was based on QPR [19].",
    "Specifically, participants listened to a 15-min lecture by psychiatrist (A.T.) that described: 1) how to directly ask a person about having thoughts of suicide, 2) how to per- suade a person to accept help, and 3) how to make a spe- cific referral to professional assistance, including provision of local and national resources. Participants then received handouts on QPR gatekeeper skills, formed dyads, and practiced the skills in a 15-min role play using a scripted scenario and skill feedback form.",
    "Finally, for the question- and-answer session, a moderator collected written ques- tions from audience members that were then directed to a panel of four bicultural and bilingual experts (a psych- iatrist, psychologist, medical interpreter, and a family physician), which lasted approximately 30 min. Attention control The control condition consisted of a lecture on the cultural context of suicide in Japan. Specifically, four university fac- ulty members provided brief presentations examining sui- cide in Japan from the viewpoint of history, anthropology, contemporary medical practice, and literature.",
    "The lecture was followed by a moderated question-and-answer session. The control event was conducted contemporaneously with the intervention, received similar publicity and promotion, and was of similar duration (1.5 h) to the intervention event. Measures A pre-post survey containing sections on background and demographic information, outcomes, and event feedback was administered to both groups.",
    "Outcome measures were largely based on similar questions used in prior stu- dies of gatekeeper training and peer recognition and re- sponse to suicidal behavior [19, 26, 27]. The survey was developed in English and a Japanese version was administered at the Japanese community event.",
    "The Japanese survey adaptation process followed a stepwise process of creating two independent translations (S.M. and R.S.), comparing and reconciling versions (S.M. and R.S.), back-translating (R.S.), and finally comparing and reconciling significant differences (S.M., R.S., A.T., and M.F.). Gatekeeper behavior We used three individuals items that assessed how likely the participant would be to do the following suicide- specific skills taught in the QPR gatekeeper training for a close person at risk for suicide: \"How likely would you be to: directly ask about suicidal thoughts; encourage to seek mental health treatment; and provide a specific phone number to get help.\"",
    "Response choices were on a five- point scale from 1 (\"very unlikely\") to 5 (\"very likely\"). Items were combined into a gatekeeper behavior scale that demonstrated adequate internal reliability (scale range: 1-5 points; a = 0.63).",
    "Self-efficacy We used four individual items that assessed how much the participant agreed with the following statements: \"I am confident in helping someone with a mental health concern\"; \"It would be easy for me to directly ask some- one close to me if he or she is thinking about suicide\"; \"If someone close to me is having a mental health problem, I can persuade him or her to get help\"; \"I know how to tell if someone close to me is at risk for suicide\". Response choices were on a five-point scale from 1 (\"strongly dis- agree\") to 5 (\"strongly agree\"). Items were also combined into a self-efficacy scale that demonstrated adequate in- ternal reliability (scale range: 1-5 points; a = 0.79).",
    "Social norms Based on prior research suggesting that social norms around mental health issues are more linked to the opinions and beliefs of close, or proximal, social con- tacts [28, 29], we constructed two items that determined agreement that most people close to them would: \"seek help from a health care provider if they were thinking about suicide\" (proximal descriptive social norm); and \"ap- prove of seeking help from a health care provider if they were thinking about suicide\" (proximal injunctive social norm). Response choices were again on the same five- point scale as for self-efficacy. The items were also com- bined into a social norms scale that demonstrated adequate internal reliability (scale range: 1-5 points; a = 0.74). Personal impact On the post-event survey only, participants were asked three items inquiring if attending the event made them un- comfortable, depressed, or anxious, with response choices on the same five-point disagree-agree scale.",
    "Page 4 of 9 Qualitative data Open-ended, written qualitative comments were soli- cited only for the intervention condition using three prompts: 1) \"What part(s) of the film really stand out in your mind? 2) \"What message in the film did you take away from watching it?; and 3) \"If you have any other comments you would like to share (including ways to improve an event like this in the future), feel free to in-",
    "clude them.\" Ten pages of single-spaced comments were collected.",
    "Data analysis The data analysis for this convergent mixed methods study involved two types of analysis. For quantitative ana- lyses, we first compared the baseline characteristics of the control and intervention groups using means with stand- ard deviations for continuous variables and frequencies with percentages for categorical variables.",
    "Similarly, we compared mean item scores between control and inter- vention groups using Fischer's exact test for categorical variables and t-tests for continuous variables. Next, we compared the within-group pre and post individual item and scale means, using t-tests. For these comparisons, we also conducted a sensitivity analysis.",
    "Because the larger size of the intervention group biases the study to find significant effects in this group, we took a randomly gen- erated subsample of intervention participants equalin number to the control group (n = 39 each). To assess the impact of the intervention on the change in scale scores from pre- to post-event for gatekeeper behavior, self-efficacy, and social norms, we constructed unadjusted and adjusted regression models.",
    "In unadjusted models, study group and pre-event scale score were inde- pendent variables. To build adjusted models, we used pur- poseful forward stepwise selection.",
    "Specifically, all baseline characteristics were examined as potential confounders by first adding each potential confounder one at a time to the unadjusted model and rating its individual impact on per- cent change in the intervention coefficient. Composite models were then created by adding in each potential con- founder in order of impact on intervention coefficient (lar- gest first) and retaining them in the composite model if the addition changed the intervention coefficient by 10 % or more.",
    "Once a variable was entered in to the model, it was not removed. Regression diagnostic procedures were per- formed to establish linearity, normality, and equal variance of the final models and to assess the models for multicolli- nearity and influential data points. Missing responses were less than 10 % for all survey items included in these ana- lyses.",
    "All statistical tests were two-tailed. Significance was considered at P < .05. Statistical analyses were performed by using Stata 13.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).",
    "Analysis of the qualitative comments was conducted as follows. First, Japanese language text was translated by a bilingual research assistant, then reviewed for ac- curacy and revised by a second bilingual research assist- ant.",
    "Next, all text along with participants' demographic information was imported into MAXQDA qualitative analysis software. Then, two research assistants inde- pendently coded text from five participants using a pre- liminary coding scheme designed for integration by using codes equivalent to key constructs in the struc- tured survey items. Differences in interpretation were few, and managed by negotiating consensus between the two raters to calibrate coding procedures.",
    "They revised the coding scheme iteratively to include emerging con- cepts as codes as well. This double-coding and revision process was repeated for another set of 10 participants, with additional attention to identification of de novo themes.",
    "To further identify patterns, we also created matrices of text organized by the question being asked and participants' race. When it was clear coding was consistent and calibrated, all remaining text was coded by a single research assistant (R.S.).",
    "The final version of the codebook included eight categories: gatekeeper behav- iors, self-efficacy, social norms, communal efforts, aware- ness and knowledge, satisfaction, personal impacts, and suggestions. Mixed methods data integration was achieved through linking of qualitative themes with the quantitative con- structs from the survey through use of joint displays. Inte- gration is a hallmark of mixed methods investigation quality [30]. Joint displays juxtapose representative quanti- tative and qualitative in a single table or figure [31]. This al- lows meta-inferences, namely, interpretations as to whether both types of data confirm, expand, or are discordant with each other [32].",
    "Results Eighty-five people attended the intervention events (56 at the English event and 29 at the Japanese event) and 48 the control event. Of these, 108 completed surveys (response rate = 81.2 %) and two were ineligible for analysis (one each for attending a prior event and for providing incom- plete responses), leaving a total sample of 106 participants. Table 1 shows that participants were generally middle- aged, highly educated, Japanese American, and members of the lay community.",
    "There were no statistically signifi- cant differences in characteristics of participants in the intervention and control groups except that control par- ticipants had on average one more year of education than intervention participants (p = 0.03). Eight-six percent of the intervention participants strongly agreed that the event was excellent, whereas only 49 % of the control group strongly agreed with the same statement (p < 0.001). This finding was confirmed by qualitative comments of 18 participants (27 %) who volunteered their satisfaction with the event (eg, \"Thank you.",

    "Second, the intervention targeted members of the lay community. Most prior studies of gatekeeper training have been conducted among individuals with some professional background and in their workplace setting, such as clinicians or school staff [37, 38].",
    "Like- wise, use of film for health education has traditionally targeted health care professional trainees [39-44]. Third, the intervention was brief.",
    "All told, it required just two hours, similar in length to standard QPR training. Other gatekeeper training programs such as Mental Health First Aid and ASIST require one to two full days of in- struction, [15, 16, 26] which we see as too long to expect significant participation levels from the general public. Several limitations of this study provide guidance for future work.",
    "First, selection bias is possible given the voluntary nature of the intervention. In an even more general community sample, it is possible that the effect size of our intervention is smaller. But it could also be even larger since our sample had high baseline levels of knowledge, experience, and confidence. Indeed, in a study of QPR gatekeeper training of staff at Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals for military veterans, results showed efficacy among clerical staff but not those with clinical backgrounds [19], which we believe may represent a ceiling effect among those with pre-existing expertise.",
    "Second, the intervention did not result in sig- nificantly more improvement than the control condition in social norms favoring help-seeking. It may be that changing such perceptions requires more repeated expo- sures or an altogether different intervention. Third, be- cause we evaluated participants immediately after the intervention, the durability of effects is unknown.",
    "Fourth, evaluation of reduction in suicidal behavior and other ob- jective behavioral indicators (eg, mental health treatment referral rates) remains for future study. Outcomes were based on self-report and blinding of research staff was not employed, which makes demand characteristics possible [45], although our active control likely reduced that risk. Finally, testing of this intervention in other settings and populations will require judicious selection of an appropri- ate film, an admittedly subjective choice for which we can- not provide empirical guidance.",
    "Appropriate film selection is not a trivial issue as studies have indicated that portrayal of suicide in film can also influence viewers' subsequent behavior in negative ways, the most extreme of which is imitative suicidal behavior [46]. Thus, we believe subse- quent work is needed to identify a list of criteria to guide film selection.",

    "The term \"co-benefits\" refers to positive outcomes accruing from a policy beyond the intended out- come, often or usually in other sectors. In the ur- ban context, policies implemented in particular sectors (such as transport, energy or waste) of- ten generate multiple co-benefits in other areas.",
    "Such benefits may be related to the reduction of local or global environmental impacts and also extend into the area of public health. A key to identifying and realising co-benefits is the adop- tion of systems approaches to understand inter- sectoral linkages and, in particular, the transla- tion of this understanding to improved sector- specific and city governance. This paper reviews a range of policies which can yield health and climate co-benefits across different urban sectors and illustrates, through a series of cases, how taking a systems approach can lead to innova- tions in urban governance which aid the devel- opment of healthy and sustainable cities.

    "The collective pressure of human activities is affecting planetary systems 1,2, in large part through the transition of human populations to urban lifestyles 3. This transition forms the backdrop for a range of imminent concerns re- lating to urban health and wellbeing and global environmental change. Some challenges, like climate change, obesity, and global biodiversity loss, are unprecedented in history and seem to increase inexorably, intractable to policy efforts at even the highest levels.",
    "Others, like urban air pollution, infectious disease outbreaks, or casu- alties from extreme events, involve phenomena for which the necessary tools for measurement, prediction and policy action have long existed, as evidenced by their effective control over long periods, yet which evade preventive efforts in the modern urban context, particularly in the devel- oping world. Policy resistance in such situations often reflects the lack of a systemic approach to the interconnected determinants of urban health, which in turn, is intrinsically linked to deficits in governance.",
    "Systems problems arise, in this setting, out of synergies between decision-making and the driving forces of modernization in complex ur- ban environments. Such problems are best ad- dressed through systems approaches designed to characterize and manage complexity while accounting for differing viewpoints and incen- tives among varied stakeholders, and acknowl- edging the distributed nature of knowledge and expertise.",
    "In particular, effective governance to improve health and wellbeing in cities requires an accurate and accessible evidence base and in- clusive decision-making processes that are both streamlined and implementable across a range of urban contexts. Although such problems are found in many domains, the focus here is on the interactions be- tween climate change, urban health and wellbe- ing, and urban planning.",
    "This paper examines the key role played by improved urban governance in facilitating the application of systems approach- es to urban health. In particular, we argue that better recognition of the climate co-benefits in health (i.e. \"win-win\" situations in which action to mitigate climate change also leads to improved health) would lead to an improvement in urban governance and allow for a more effective ap- proach to health in cities.",
    "This is a particularly relevant context in which to apply systems ap- proaches, since innovative solutions can be iden- tified and implemented locally.",
    "This is critically important at the city scale 4, where decisions at higher levels can lag or are absent altogether. In order to examine systems approaches to health/environment co-benefits in cities, this paper provides a systematic discussion of the linkages between climate change, health and wellbeing, and governance in the urban context, collecting and summarizing relevant literature in these areas.",
    "However, owing to the combined breadth of these topics, the authors acknowledge that this is neither a comprehensive literature review nor a meta-analysis with specific search criteria and keywords commonly found in the public health literature. The topics under consid- eration are very broad and may be discussed in publications that do not necessarily feature the relevant keywords (for example, many discus- sions on urban energy are in publications analyz- ing energy generation more generally).",
    "Indeed, such a review would be prohibitively long for this publication. We therefore suggest this paper be taken as a conceptual analysis rather than a sys- tematic review.",
    "We initially summarize the health impacts of climate change in cities and the general foun- dations of systems approaches. We then typify health/climate co-benefits in different urban sectors, consider the characteristics of systems thinking in the specific context of improvements in urban governance, and illustrate these con- cepts via a set of case examples. The impacts of climate change on health in cities Patterns of climate change The anticipated effects of climate change are wide-ranging, but their extent and geographic distribution depends on collective decisions made over the next few decades to curb green- house gas (GHG) emissions, limit biodiversity loss and moderate consumption.",
    "Even if mean global temperature rise is limited to 2oC, which for many now seems unlikely, certain effects such as sea-level rise have become unavoidable. Other patterns can be forecasted with some degree of confidence.",
    "For example, it is likely that storm systems will become larger and stronger, and that droughts and heatwaves will intensify 5,6,7. Climate change-induced food and water secu- rity are also major concerns in some geographic zones (e.g., as a result of accelerated desertifica- tion in Sahelian Africa) 8, as is consequent popu- lation movement on mass scales 9.",

    "Saude Publica, Rio de Janeiro, 31 Sup:S25-S38, 2015 S27 Climate impacts on health in cities In general, climate effects on health can be cate- gorized as primary - encompassing direct climat- ic environmental exposures; secondary - involv- ing disruptions to ecosystems; or tertiary - in- volving social and economic disruptions driven by climate change 10,11,12 (Table 1). At all scales, cities are at particular risk for ad- verse health outcomes from climate change 13. For one, cities concentrate people and infra- structure, leaving them more vulnerable to fo- cal extreme climate events (e.g., hurricanes, droughts) - such events can impact cities di- rectly or indirectly, through food supply chains, regional economic impacts and other pathways.",
    "Given the necessity of water for human life and livelihoods, urban settlements are often coastal, and therefore often at high risk from sea-level rise or hydrological or geological events 14. In- deed, there is concern that sea-level rise will displace significant populations in the coming century 15, many of which will migrate to cities unprepared to absorb these new residents.",
    "Moreover, because cities are where most people now live, they bear increased vulnerabil- ity in situations of local resource scarcity, such as droughts and famines, which impact their catchment areas. Issues of scarcity are to some extent offset by the greater connectivity urban areas enjoy compared to remote rural zones, but even well-connected cities can be overwhelmed by severe shortages, particularly in the develop- ing world, where economic resources are insuf- ficient to offset shortfalls. As with sea-level rise, scarcity-inducing events can also spur increases in migration 16.",
    "Attributes of the built environment in cities generate micro-environmental conditions that can generate unique risks in conjunction with climate change - for example, urban heat is- lands act synergistically with more frequent and intense heat waves to enhance health risks from thermal stress 17, and urban agriculture or green space can generate risk for vector-borne diseas- es 18,19,20, which may themselves undergo geo- graphic expansion with a warming climate 21. In a similar vein, the byproducts of urban activ- ity (e.g., air pollution) can act in synergy with climatic factors to enhance health risks (e.g., al- lergic respiratory ailments) 22,23.",
    "The relationship between urbanization, ur- ban metabolism and climate change is, more- over, bidirectional - i.e., cities also affect climate, given that they are the origin of most resource demand and the location of most consump- tion. Cities may account for over 80% of global GHG emissions 3. The impact of cities on climate change is one link in a reinforcing feedback chain that ultimately has major consequences for hu- man health and wellbeing 24.",
    "Unequal impacts Inequity in impacts and resilience is a criti- cal dimension of urban vulnerability to climate change. On a micro scale, slums and informal settlements, generally occupied by the poor, face disproportionately greater risks related to cli- mate change 25 and health 26. They are often un- planned, lacking both the infrastructure and ser- vice base of wealthier neighborhoods. They are more frequently populated by recent migrants than are other areas, and may thus lack networks for social support.",

    "techniques can represent non-linear and feed- back relationships). Such approaches explicitly incorporate feedback structures, threshold ef- fects and other nonlinearities, allowing for simu- lation, scenario testing, the identification of sys- temic leverage points, and optimization.",
    "They may also include individual-based or aggregate models, structured spatially or along network frameworks at multiple scales. Systems approaches Interdisciplinarity It is increasingly recognized that complex prob- lems of urban management and development require approaches that go beyond traditional norms in scientific inquiry and policy-making 4,24,27,28. This is particularly evident with respect to assuring urban health and wellbeing in the context of climate change. Conventional ap- proaches often fail to achieve long-term objec- tives because they (a) focus on limited, siloed or less-relevant aspects of the problem; (b) lack an effective interface between those responsible for constructing the evidence base and those that make decisions; (c) fail to account for adverse incentives on the part of either scientists or de- cision-makers in urban planning and manage- ment; or (d) fail to integrate insights and knowl- edge from these various domains 29.",
    "Systems approaches are designed to effectively address these concerns. We distinguish four main ele- ments of such approaches, relating to analytic method, interdisciplinarity, transdisciplinarity, and scaling/bounding. Analytic method Traditional methods in epidemiology and other public health sciences tend to be reductive: that is, they focus on identifying the independent ef- fects of individual variables. While there is no de- nying the historical value such work has brought to the study of health, or indeed its present utility in situations where causality is straightforward, reductive methods tend to fail in the face of complexity, such as seen in urban systems - for example, where feedback structures, dynamic decision-making processes or threshold effects produce non-linear relationships. Ever-more-intricate empirical statistical analyses of association have made substantial inroads in identifying complex causal relation- ships - e.g., through the use of latent variable approaches, multilevel and structural equation modeling. Yet such relationships are often best identified through dynamical systems modeling approaches, broadly defined (Hovmand 30 ex- plores the circumstances under which the two Beyond systems-based analytic methods, a key element of systems approaches is scientific and/ or professional interdisciplinarity. A defining characteristic of urban systems is complexity, and the more complex the system, the less likely that any one practitioner - or set of researchers from a single disciplinary field - can accurately define the scope of the problem or the system in question.",
    "Interdisciplinarity involves integrating the disciplinary knowledge (i.e., concepts, meth- ods and principles) of practitioners from differ- ent fields to develop a shared more complete un- derstanding of a problem 31. Systems approaches thus necessarily involve not only teams of scientists from substantially different disciplinary backgrounds, but also ur- ban design professionals - as well as methods for blending knowledge, identifying key common- alities and differences in understanding, har- monizing data design and collection, and rec- ognizing valid systemic relationships 32.",
    "In this regard, cognitive science can and should play a significant role, however a substantial shift in attitudes on the part of scientists, planners and ancillary communities (including funding agen- cies) is also needed. Transdisciplinarity Understanding how to resolve real-world prob- lems goes well beyond identifying causes and ef- fects in vitro or in silico.",
    "In particular, it requires understanding how incentive structures and the variable behavior of different stakeholders affect the feasibility of policy actions, and how dynamic changes in the system in response to policy can lead to new incentives for decision and policy- makers and the general population - and, no less, for the scientific community. Moreover, it involves translating new understandings of sys- tem behavior into actionable recommendations. Tackling such questions involves transdisci- plinarity - the incorporation of stakeholders be-",

    "This is necessary to provide an accurate understanding of feasibility and incentives, to sensitize scientists and urban planners to the political and policy context - and conversely, decision-makers to the evidence base - and to generate the will for sustained collective action. Effective transdisciplinary approaches also incorporate communities and citizens, and hence increase accountability among decision- making entities. Scaling/bounding One persistent issue with systems problems is the likelihood that both causes and effects will cross institutional, physical or geographic deci- sion-making boundaries. Such transboundary problems complicate effective short- and long- term control efforts in that decision-making enti- ties often lack control of the causes of problems within their jurisdictions.",
    "Conversely, many of the consequences of their decisions may be felt outside their ambit. This is particularly true for cities, which drive environmental impacts over a much broader footprint than the urbanized zone and which are vulnerable to health conse- quences from processes occurring far beyond their borders. Systems approaches address the multi-scale nature of systems problems by incorporating stakeholders from multiple geographic, disci- plinary and decision-making domains and by explicitly modeling multi-scale effects.",
    "Co-benefits in cities: linking climate change and urban health across multiple sectors The reduction of carbon emissions lies at the heart of current efforts to combat climate change, yet it also has consequences for urban health. Actions under this strategy broadly fall into two logical categories, namely shifting from carbon-intensive fuels to cleaner forms of energy and increasing energy efficiency. While such ef- forts find their broadest expression in national- level energy policy, the complexity of the systems that give rise to carbon emissions leads to a diver- sity of implementations in different sectors and across different levels of governance. Thus, in the transport sector, reduction of carbon emissions is often characterized by an improvement in vehicle efficiency and shift from private vehicles to public transit options.",
    "Yet be- cause carbon reductions have as much to do with extent of travel as they do with mode of travel, solutions supersede technical considerations to encompass those social and economic dimen- sions of urban lifestyles which generate the need to take trips 33. The way cities are laid out and the relative locations of goods and services are also clearly relevant to travel and emissions. Land use affects the amount of green space in a city, which in turn can alter urban heat island effects and consequently energy demands from build- ings - also affected by building design and the efficiency of home appliances. A range of climate mitigation benefits can also be obtained from the waste sector in terms of how waste is sorted and processed 34.",
    "It becomes clear that a range of in- terlinked planning and regulatory actions, when tackled simultaneously, can give rise to signifi- cant reductions in climate-altering pollutants 35. Each of the structural factors and policy op- tions described in the preceding paragraph also has local consequences for health.",
    "These overlapping effects allow for the identification of co-benefits between actions designed to re- duce carbon emissions and consequent health outcomes. \"Co-benefits\" is a term increasingly widely used in discussions on climate change policy - it essentially refers to the planned ancil- lary benefits of any given policy 36.",
    "In reality, most policies imply a range of outcomes (intended and unintended; positive and negative); therefore, understanding the effects of policies in sectors beyond their original scope is critical. Emerging research is now explicitly focusing on the kinds of co-benefits that can accrue from well-planned interventions in different urban sectors 35.",
    "Cli- mate co-benefits in health encompass win-win opportunities for simultaneously tackling cli- mate change and improving health. Ideally, sys- tems approaches can help identify synergies and trade-offs across sectors, yet the potential opportunities and benefits of applying such ap- proaches in health promotion remain relatively undeveloped in practice 37. This section briefly outlines potential sectors where co-benefits for health are anticipated.",
    "Transport Urban transport affects health in various inter- connected domains: respiratory and other ail- ments resulting from air pollution produced in the combustion of fuels; physical injury which may result from high speeds or traffic volumes or design characteristics of the built environment; stress and other factors affecting mental health that arise from features of transport or mobil- ity, such as time spent commuting; and cardio- vascular and other health risks arising from the increasingly sedentary nature of modern life - in part the result of planning decisions about URBAN GOVERNANCE AND APPROACHES TO HEALTH-ENVIRONMENT CO-BENEFITS IN CITIESCad.

    "There is a growing body of evidence regarding the deleterious health effects arising from these vari- ous sources. Of these, physical inactivity, which has soared over the last few decades, appears to pose the greatest health risks, as it has a direct relation with obesity, diabetes and cardiovascu- lar disease. In a study comparing London and Delhi, \"active transport\" (walking and cycling) of- fered the greatest health benefits in terms of dis- ability adjusted life years (DALYs), by an order of 5-10 over switching to cleaner fuels alone, whilst a combination of both strategies was found to be even more beneficial 38.",
    "Concern initially manifested over the relation- ship between urban transport and health in areas where widespread car use first proliferated 39. Pendola & Gen 40 reported a relationship between urban density and car use and between critically increased body-mass index (BMI) values for us- ers who reported high levels of car use. Although the US has some of the highest obesity rates in the world, Day et al. 41 also reported rapidly in- creasing levels of obesity linked to increased car use and low-density residential living in China. The complex of characteristics of modern urban organization which provide the conditions for physical inactivity in a population have been la- belled the \"obesogenic urban form\" 42,43.",
    "Despite advances in vehicle technology, many cities in the world still experience unac- ceptable levels of air pollution. For example, Doll 44 estimated that over three-quarters of a bil- lion people are exposed to PM10 levels exceeding even the least-stringent World Health Organiza- tion (WHO) pollution control guidelines in urban areas. Exposure to air pollution increases mor- bidity and mortality from respiratory illnesses and cardiovascular disease; in 2012, there were 3.7 million premature deaths related to outdoor air pollution 45.",
    "Many of these could be prevented by reducing dependence on private motor cars and shifting to clean public transport as well as active transport. Whilst necessary, such a shift is not sufficient and the integration of sustainable transport planning into the built environment is crucial. For example, the provision of walk- able and cyclable areas is essential to ensure that gains from active transport are not offset by in- creased risk of collision with motorized vehicles. Land use The health benefits of sensibly planned urban areas, and particularly so-called \"green infra- structure\" 46, are manifold.",
    "Green areas cool cit- ies, countering the urban heat island effect, and filter the air of pollutants; they also act as loca- tions where residents can exercise and engage in other outdoor activities. When sited as com- munal parks, village greens and town squares, they can also foster a sense of community, so- cial cohesion and even build an appreciation of nature and environmental responsibility. Other types of green infrastructure such as wetlands or urban forests may also provide environmental co-benefits such as water filtration and storm water regulation 46.",
    "Tzoulas et al. 47 cite a range of experimental and epidemiological studies and surveys which indicate benefits from green spaces, related to the innate need of humans for contact with nature for psychological well-being; among these are increased longevity, better self-reported health outcomes, greater relaxation levels, quicker re- covery from stressful situations, and lessened ag- gression as a result of reduced fatigue. Bowler et al. 48 systematically reviewed evidence of benefits from exposure to natural environments, finding overall improved levels of energy and decreased negative emotions such as anxiety, anger, fatigue and sadness.",

    "Urban energy The chief health impact of the urban fuel cycle derives from incomplete combustion when fuel carbon is converted to health-damaging pollut- ants. About half of the world's households (main- ly rural) use solid fuels (biomass and coal) for cooking and heating in simple devices that pro- duce large amounts of air pollution 50. Although the use of biomass is lower in cities, poor popula- tions in cities still use a range of fuels which cause adverse health effects. In developing countries, significant health co-benefits can be achieved by replacing existing inefficient indoor and outdoor cooking systems with increased-efficiency, low-emission stoves and also by improving the energy efficiency of appliances in buildings, which would result in Oliveira JAP et al.",

Impacts can also be made on the demand side of the energy equation. Improving ventila- tion performance in an attempt to reduce energy demand not only reduces air-flow from outdoor air pollution but also reduces fossil fuel con- sumption in power plants, which has an indirect effect on health protection in cities.",
    "Distributed power generation through multiple micro gener- ation facilities is expected to play an increasingly important role in cities, and such new modes, in tandem with energy generation from renew- able resources, are seen as critical for meeting GHG reduction targets - although this is not only an urban issue. Changing methods of electricity generation to reduce GHG emissions, particu- larly by reducing the use of coal, would reduce particulate air pollution (PM10 and PM2.5) that can harm health. Mitigating climate change via intervention in the urban energy system thus presents excellent opportunities for improving public health through reductions in acute respi- ratory infections, tuberculosis, chronic bronchi- tis and lung cancer 51.",
    "Poorly constructed and maintained houses are more likely to be inhabited by people with low incomes and this too has an indirect effect on health 52. Developing methods for retrofit- ting low-income apartments and single-room occupancies that achieve energy savings and simultaneous indoor air quality improvements can make residents more resilient to increasing energy prices and improve their health.

    "Improved governance as a component of systems approaches Traditional approaches to dealing with urban development and health are largely dissociated one from the other. For example, decisions about short- or long-term investments in develop- ment of water and sewage infrastructure rarely involve consultation with health specialists, departments or ministries. The same is true for transportation and land-use.",
    "Conversely, health departments rarely involve stakeholders in urban development in investment decisions for health infrastructure or services. Strengthening governance through the ap- plication of systems approaches could help real- ize the health co-benefits of a low carbon urban development path and lead to improved man- agement of both climate change and health.

It can be polycentric and comprises institutions and processes enshrined in formal rules (e.g., constitutions and laws), pri- vate actors (civil society, non-governmental or- ganizations - NGOs, communities, and business- es) and also informal activities and processes 53.",
    "Aside from efficiency in delivering specific policy results, \"good governance\", as a policy objective, denotes the ethical procedural functioning of a governance system, encompassing such values as participation, transparency, accountability, decency, sustainability or fairness 53.Thus, it in- herently incorporates the systems principles of inter- and transdisciplinarity. Beyond measures of process, effective governance yields positive outcomes - indeed, good governance provides a favorable context for sustainable development 54, and may particularly influence the social deter- minants of health 53. For example, increasing citi- zen participation in urban investments through participatory budgeting has had positive impacts on public health, including reduction in health inequalities 26.",
    "Many of the investments chosen by communities in their areas addressed the un- derlying causes of urban health problems, such as lack of sanitation. Urban areas are complex systems, dynamic in time and diverse in space.",

Moreover, there are great disparities in resources and capacity between cit- ies in higher versus middle- and low-income set- tings. Yet some commonalities also exist 55, no- tably the profusion of public and private urban actors, working at different levels of governments (national, regional, local, or even international) and at various physical scales, sometimes be- yond the legal boundaries of a city. Indeed, issues of scaling/bounding are one common feature of systems problems.",
    "Another common feature of urban governance frameworks is an evolution- ary trend from a government approach in which legitimacy relies largely on authority towards a governance approach involving more stakehold- ers in decision-making processes 56. Where this is the case, values and tools such as participation, accountability, and legitimacy have assumed greater weight in political discourses. Finally, cit- ies are highly contested places, where land ten- ure, shelter and economic development are criti- cal issues and all have important impacts on the health and wellbeing of citizens 55. Against this backdrop, three areas 57 under the broad framework of governance offer prom- ise for innovative thinking and more effective outcomes: understanding the urban context; en- gaging and organizing stakeholders; and ensur- ing effectiveness.",

We now analyze those areas and provide examples from different contexts. Understanding the context Improving governance through systems ap- proaches requires a sufficiently complete over- view of the context within which health - or lack thereof - arises.",
    "In fact, although climate change is a global phenomenon, its impacts depend to a large extent on local conditions 58. It is thus criti- cal to understand local vulnerability - \"the degree to which a system is susceptible to, and unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change\" 59 (p. 89). Vulnerability itself is determined by a sys- tem's exposure, sensitivity (\"the degree to which a system is affected, either adversely or beneficially, by climate variability or climate change\") 59 (p. 86) and adaptive capacity (\"the whole of capa- bilities, resources and institutions of a country or region to implement effective adaptation mea- sures\") 59 (p. 76).

Thorough analysis also requires mapping of urban actors and their powers and interactions, as well as influential policies and institutions. To fully comprehend vulnerability in urban settings, the knowledge of local dwellers is also key, as they experience and notice changes on the ground.",
    "Collaboration between scientists, other urban actors, and local populations - i.e. inter- and transdisciplinarity - is therefore a first step in the process of adapting and reforming systems that assure urban health and wellbeing (Figure 1). Identifying, engaging and organizing stakeholders Systems approaches to urban health issues call for participatory and inclusive decision-making processes 27, which can identify co-benefits that might otherwise be overlooked in a more sectoral, top-down approach. This requires in- volving all stakeholders in a given city, includ- ing communities and citizens, public authori- ties, businesses and even external actors, such as funding agencies.",

This community-level participatory process has improved awareness and yielded positive results in the fight against dengue 65,66.",
    "effective participatory processes: first, empower citizens through awareness-raising activities and establish common interests groups to prepare participation; second, facilitate dialogue and col- laboration between urban actors. Empowering people is especially important for the poorest segment of the population which is also often the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change on health.",
    "For instance, lack of tenure rights and access to essential services experienced by slum dwellers affects their liveli- hoods and health. Gathering people in groups of shared interests raises their profile. People are thus easier to reach and capacity-building schemes can be tailored to their needs.",
    "It is then important to design policy processes in such a way as to ensure that these different groups meet and are heard. This can ease the acceptance of norms later on and thus increase their legiti- macy 60.",
    "At the same time, a multi-stakeholder approach is also relevant within governments to overcome sectoral barriers. In fact, some sectoral activities may generate co-benefits across sectors (Figure 2).",
    "Ensuring the effectiveness of decisions, norms and governance frameworks From a systems perspective, one aspect of better governance is the implementation of the policies and enforcement of the agreements and norms adopted through participatory and other deci- sion-making processes. Decision-makers should be held accountable and citizens informed of activities undertaken to that end. In addition, mechanisms to enforce those \"negotiated\" laws and regulations, for instance judicial proceed- ings, are a key complementary tool to make sure that policy-makers and individuals' duties and rights are upheld. In this regard, the rights-based approach is a conceptual framework used by development agencies to promote the empowerment of peo- ple through their capacity to know and claim the protection of human rights.",
    "In the urban con- text, citizens demand the provision of basic ser- vices such as waste management, clean water availability and education. These then become standards that public authorities have to meet. Against this background, judges may have to protect citizens from interventions by the public and private sectors, such as land evictions, when they have an impact on health and wellbeing 61 (Figure 3).",
    "Discussion and conclusions Systems approaches are an essential element of improved governance geared toward deal- ing more effectively with the complex interac- tions between environmental change and urban health. Good governance could facilitate a co- benefits perspective and strengthen decision- making and implementation of urban develop- ment interventions.",

    "The network works directly with the local Centre for Health Promotion. This representation of the interests of diverse groups of city inhabitants to a public authority has allowed the direct presentation and prioritization of local needs. The various stakeholders slowly formed a partnership and undertook development programs, tackling health-related issues such as prevention of diseases and poor nutrition 55.

    "On this basis, several PILs were filed in the 1980s to draw attention to the high level of air pollution in Delhi and its impacts on health. The Center for Science and Environment (CSE) published a book 70 highlighting an estimated 10,000 people per year (more than one an hour) were dying prematurely due to air pollution in Delhi 71 - and a recent analysis suggests this figure continues to rise 72.",
    "As vehicular pollution accounts for 64% of the total pollution load in Delhi 68,73, the Court made decisions ordering the governments of the National Capital Territory of Delhi and the Union of India to enforce existing environmental legislation. It also supported the establishment of a permanent Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority for the National Capital Region.",
    "The Court also issued more technical orders, such as the conversion of the entire bus fleet to compressed natural gas - a clean fuel - within three years 68.

In particular the level of suspended particulate matters has decreased by 26% 68,74. traditions, which, while (usually) competent for their given remit, generally address any emer- gent urban problem using the tools most com- fortable to their practitioners.",
    "This runs the risk of creating gaps in coverage of important issues, or worse, generating internecine conflict when attempting to implement cross-cutting strategies aimed to address an emergent problem. Paralysis may ensue, with poor coordination or even com- petition between these fragmented governance frameworks. We must therefore create the insti- tutional mechanisms and incentives to enable these sectors to effectively work together.",
    "Second, we need to think about the design of service providers and reforms carried forward, particularly in recent decades, which have ag- gravated the problems described in the previous paragraph. Trends in public management, such as corporatization and privatization of certain public services, can exacerbate cross-sectoral problems, as results-based organizations are reluctant or unwilling to share resources or in- formation with other organizations, implying, as this does, higher costs or loss of competitive ad- vantage 64.",
    "Designing services in such a way that providers can be held accountable to the public and are prepared to work together would allow for a more systematic approach to issues of cli- mate change and urban health. Third, we should make greater efforts to bring together different civil society stakeholders in the decision-making process.

Broad and open con- sultations about short- and long-term develop- ment plans could help to incorporate other views and information in development pathways, lead- ing to improved decision-making and possibly to increases in co-benefits.",
    "Fourth, systems approaches are not silver bullets capable of resolving all problems with a single policy. Transport, energy and land-use planning often complement each other but their health effects can be quite different. For example, green areas, which are considered good for city ambience, exercise and mental health, must not come at the expense of an expansive urban form with increased reliance on high levels of personal transit, nor should they provide conditions for the spread of vector-borne diseases.",
    "The inherent complexity of these issues underscores the fact that no single policy is a panacea. However, there are generally too many plans, with not enough thought given to coordination and implemen- tation.",
    "We highlight the need for systems ap- proaches as a means to better integrate sectors and that seeking out co-benefits can facilitate such integration. Fifth, in moving towards systems approaches in urban health, tools that explicitly and quanti- tatively estimate health co-benefits can improve sectoral integration and decision-making 36. However, to move beyond the modelling stage, consideration needs to be given to how such measures can be implemented at the city scale. Critically, we must move beyond the siloed think- ing that exists across sectors and urban gover- nance. Training policy-makers in simple systems thinking and systems interactions will be ben- eficial, however ultimately there needs to be a change in the incentive structure in governance that rewards addressing urban issues from a sys- temic rather than a sectoral standpoint.",

Prevalences of low physical activity and high sedentary behaviour (>=8 hours per 16 waking hours) were based on self- reports among adolescents or accelerometer data among adults and the elderly from three Finnish population studies: FINFIT 2017, Health 2011 and the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study.",

INTRODUCTION Self- reported data indicate that, worldwide, around a third of adults do not reach the recommended weekly level of aerobic physical activity.1 In Finland, estimates of the proportion of adults meeting the health- enhancing- aerobic- physical- activity recommendation range from accelerometer- measured 22.5%2 to 31% from self- reporting.3 Physical activity is unquestionably relevant for public health: there is an established relationship between a physically active lifestyle and a lower risk of many non- communicable diseases, all- cause mortality4 5 and a higher quality of life.6 Additionally, high sedentary behaviour, physical- activity irrespective of meeting recommendations, has been shown to pose an independent risk of deleterious health outcomes (eg, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, all- cause mortality).6 7 However, according to Ekelund et al,8 high levels of moderate- intensity physical activity (about 60-75 min per day) seem to eliminate the increased risk of death associated with high sitting time.",

Alongside the direct costs due to non- communicable diseases and all- cause mortality, research in this area pinpoints a connection between physical activity and labour market rewards such as higher earnings10-13 and employment.11 14-16 Inversely, physical inactivity may diminish individuals' work ability or attachment to the labour market, thereby leading to higher indirect costs. We undertook this study to estimate direct and indirect costs attributable to low physical activity and high sedentary behaviour levels in Finland in 2017, thereby contributing to the discussion in three important ways. First, our study enriches understanding of costs arising from physical inac- tivity by considering not only direct costs related to healthcare but also indirect costs, including sickness- related absences, disability pension, losses in income taxes and unemployment benefits.",

Lastly, our sedentary behaviour- related estimates cover both the healthcare and productivity costs.",

Relative risks (RRs) for each non- communicable disease were mainly based on values reported in meta- analyses and were age- adjusted.",
    "However, most RRs were adjusted for several factors, such as physical activity, age, body mass index, smoking habits and education (see table 2). Total annual costs were obtained by multiplying the PAF by the total costs of the non- communicable disease of interest (see tables 1 and 2 and online supplemental table 1).",

Self- reported physical activity was assessed at the age of 15. On average, 67% of the adolescents were physically inactive while the proportion of physically active adolescents was 33% (see online supplemental table 4).",
    "To account for variables that could confound the association between physical inactivity and indi- rect labour market costs in adulthood, we adjusted the models for several family- background factors (see online supplemental table 5).

    "RESULTS Direct costs The annual direct costs of physical inactivity totalled approxi- mately EUR683 million (see table 3), or 22% of the estimated direct costs of non- communicable diseases (see online supplemental material, tables 1-2). Costs from institutional eldercare repre- sented 61% of the direct costs of physical inactivity (see table 3). The costliest non- communicable disease concerning the work- ing- age population was type 2 diabetes, constituting the highest economic burden from physical inactivity, roughly EUR153 million/ year (see online supplemental table 2).",
    "In contrast, the largest component of direct costs due to high sedentary behaviour was the use of healthcare services, accounting for 74% of the EUR469 million total sum (see table 3). As in the case of physical inactivity, type 2 diabetes constituted a considerable economic burden, representing approximately 91% of the total direct costs attributable to high sedentary behaviour (see online supplemental table 3). Indirect costs Annual indirect costs due to physical inactivity totalled approxi- mately EUR2546 million (see table 3) with EUR1844 million in income tax losses representing 72% of the costs (see table 3 and online supplemental table 5). Indirect costs of non- communicable diseases (sickness- related absences, disability pension and all- cause mortality) totalled approximately EUR681 million, with nearly half of these costs (48%) being attributable to disability pension (see table 3).",
    "All- cause mortality accounted for 44% of indirect costs of these diseases.",
    "The indirect costs due to high sedentary behaviour totalled EUR1034 million (see table 3), of which disability- pension payments accounted for 67%.IL.Protectedbycopyright. Total costs With direct and indirect costs taken together, total costs of physical inactivity in 2017 were approximately EUR3.2 billion (see table 3). The greatest economic burden related to physical inactivity was from lost income tax (EUR1.8 billion), followed by institutional eldercare (EUR419 million) and disability- pension payments related to non- communicable diseases (EUR325 million) (see table 3).",
    "When the economic burden due to physical inac- tivity was broken down by disease, type 2 diabetes was the largest component (total costs: EUR391 million), depression the second- largest (EUR89 million) and stroke the third- largest (EUR46 million) (see online supplemental table 2). The costs of high sedentary behaviour totalled roughly EUR1.5 billion (see table 3). Sensitivity analysis The first sensitivity analysis, using 85% instead of 78% as the proportion for physically inactive adults, suggests direct and productivity- related costs (excluding unemployment benefits and lost income tax revenue) of EUR1469 million instead of the EUR1363 million we obtained (not shown in table).",
    "The second analysis involved a friction- cost approach to mortality costs: with Kolu P, et al. J Epidemiol Community Health 2022;76:677-684.",
    "doi:10.1136/jech-2021-217998iJEpdemoilCommunityHealth:firstpublishedas./jech--onApril.lDownoadedfromhttp://jech.bmj.com/onJanuary,atAcqusitiionDepartment a 3-6 month friction period, direct and productivity costs were EUR1139 million and EUR1214 million, respectively. With the third analysis, the total costs, assuming a higher prevalence of non- communicable diseases in 2019, rose to EUR1351 million. Thus, the results suggest that the costs from non- communicable diseases may lie in the EUR1214-EUR1469 million range.",
    "The fourth analysis based on the 6 hours cut- off of sedentary behaviour indicated costs of EUR1.7 billion (not shown in table). Lastly, if the aggregate indirect labour market costs were based on PSM instead of OLS estimates, the approximate costs would be EUR2.3 billion in income tax losses (95% CI: EUR850 million to EUR3.7 billion) and EUR41 million in unemployment benefits paid (95% CI: EUR22 million to EUR59 million) (see online supplemental table 6). These aggregate costs are EUR490 million higher (EUR470 million from tax losses plus EUR20 million from unemployment benefits) than those obtained via OLS estimates.",
    "DISCUSSION This study used several data sets and evaluated the direct and indi- rect costs of low physical activity and high sedentary behaviour from a societal perspective. The findings extend insights into costs arising from physical inactivity and sedentary behaviour, through encompassing not only direct healthcare costs but also indirect costs from sickness- related absences, disability payments, income tax losses and unemployment benefits.",
    "The results attest to substantial costs of low physical activity (EUR3.2 billion) and high sedentary behaviour (EUR1.5 billion) in Finland in 2017, thereby showing that actions to increase phys- ical activity levels and reduce excessive sedentary behaviour would be beneficial. For example, greater physical activity would produce higher income tax revenue and reduce healthcare expen- diture--in 2017 alone, Finland's direct healthcare expenditure was EUR20.6 billion.30 Our results indicate that roughly 1.3% of the latter expenditure (excluding costs of institutional eldercare) is attributable to physical inactivity (see online supplemental table 2).",
    "This proportion is consistent with previous findings that physical inactivity represents approximately 0.3%-4.6% of the nation's healthcare costs.31 While Ding et al9 estimated the corresponding direct healthcare costs to the Finnish public sector in 2013 at 86 million euros (international dollar values from 2013 were converted to 2017 euros, with inflation considered), our figures were considerably higher. We found the healthcare costs borne by the public sector to be EUR263 million.",
    "There are several reasons for these divergent results. First, the study by Ding and colleagues used a self- reported 27%-29% prevalence for physical inactivity, which is a considerably lower proportion than our accelerometer measurements revealed (77%).",
    "Second, that study obtained total healthcare costs per disease case by dividing the total healthcare costs for the disease by the case count, whereas we based the healthcare cost values on the actual use of healthcare services as per national registries. In addition, our estimations factored in also the costs of depression, fractures and back pain in addition to coronary heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, breast cancer and colon cancer, which explains the higher costs in our study.",
    "The costs related to high sedentary behaviour, in turn, were found considerably lower in UK than in Finland (PS677 million vs EUR1.5 billion).7 There are at least three reasons. First, the UK study considered fewer diseases. Also, the direct healthcare costs found for type 2 diabetes in UK were considerably lower than those found for Finland, and only 30% of adults in UK appeared to meet the criterion on high sedentariness for weekdays (>=6 hours/day), as per a questionnaire, while 83% of Finnish Original research adults were sedentary more than 8 hours/day. Lastly, our seden- tary behaviour- related estimates cover both the healthcare and productivity costs.",
    "In calculations, physical inactivity and sedentary behaviour are treated as binary variables. However, in reality, there is a gradient between the volume of sedentary behaviour and the risk of non- communicable diseases: for example, 6 hours of daily sedentary behaviour increase risk to a certain extent, but 7 hours of sedentary behaviour increase more and 8 hours even more. Similarly, the risk of non- communicable diseases increases while the volume of weekly physical activity decreases.",
    "Underestimation of costs There are some issues that may lead to underestimation of total costs. One of these stems from missing information. Public regis- ters did not provide all the essential diagnosis- linked informa- tion on medication and disability pension for fractures, breast cancer and colon cancer.",
    "Additionally, information on inpatient care for back pain is absent because this condition was only recently added to the register data. Moreover, private- sector healthcare and occupational health costs were not included since that information was inaccessible as well. Second, most short- duration sickness- related absences (<11 days) were excluded because of missing information.",
    "The third limitation is related to the use of RRs. They were all based on self- reports, not on accelerometer data, so they may under- represent the actual risks.",
    "Also, self- reported physical activity and sitting time are over- estimated/underestimated compared with accelerometer- based data reveal.32 In addition, not all RRs had the same number of adjustments. Fourth, not every disease had an adjustment factor (see table 2) that explores differences in physical activity and sedentary behaviour between the less active cases with non- communicable diseases and more active healthy participants.",
    "Therefore, low physical activity among the cases with depres- sion, back pain, fractures, Alzheimer's disease and breast cancer may be underestimated. Consequently, physical inactivity among cases may be underestimated concerning depression, back pain, fractures, Alzheimer's disease and breast cancer. Though we used adjusted RRs, figures for the prevalence of physical inactivity in our PAF- based estimation were largely based on a healthy popu- lation, because inactivity data were not available from people with the non- communicable disease of interest.",
    "Lastly, while the costs related to type 2 diabetes were based on the year 2011, the prevalence of this disease has shown a steady increase in Finland over 2000-2017.33 Therefore, we assume that the costs found would have been higher if the current costs from type 2 diabetes had been used instead. Overestimation of costs Overestimation of the total costs is also possible, and at least four potential concerns need to be discussed in interpreting the results. First, our evaluation of lost productivity applied the commonly used human- capital approach for calculating all- cause mortality.28 This yields much higher costs compared with costs from the friction- cost method. One argument for our choice, however, is that all- cause mortality among working- age people is a substantial economic loss from the societal perspec- tive, especially in countries such as Finland where society pays for all education. Second, our estimate for institutional eldercare may be high since only stroke could be considered as a comor- bidity of dementia due to absent information34 and because the proportions for diseases in the institutional eldercare were based on capital- area data, not nationwide data, which may reduce the Kolu P, et al.",

    "Third, we could not exclude fractures caused by accidents from fractures caused by falling. Fourth, the costs connected with income taxes and unemployment benefits were based on a relatively small sample, about 2000 persons, so one should interpret the results with caution.",
    "Furthermore, the associations between adolescent physical inactivity and labour market outcomes in adulthood are not direct evidence of causality. There are many potential mediators through which childhood physical inactivity may affect labour market outcomes: health, cognitive and non- cognitive skills, networking and positive discrimination.4 9 10 16-18 The association may even be spurious, stemming from unobserved factors affecting both adolescence physical inactivity and adulthood labour market performance. Hence, the findings suggesting higher unemploy- ment benefits and lower income taxes for adolescents classified as physically inactive might have emerged irrespective of child- hood physical activity levels. Although we were able to control for many possible confounding factors, such as childhood health, education and family background (eg, parents' education and physical activity), a wide range of unobserved confounding factors may remain.",
    "Limitations of the study The major limitation of our study is that the healthcare costs obtained from the hospital- discharge register were from 2016 but the physical inactivity and sedentary behaviour data were from 2017. That said, physical inactivity has provably remained quite stable; for example, the proportion of age- standardised physical inactivity among 20-69 year- olds was 78.6% in the Health 2011 study and 77.5% in the FINFIT 2017 study.2 35 Also register- based studies have certain limitations, for example, diagnoses can be misclassified or unavailable. Neither do the register data provide all relevant background information since the data have not collected for research purposes.",
    "Moreover, the costs of sedentary behaviour were calculated assuming that there is no risk of diseases if the daily sedentary behaviour is below 8 hours during the 16 hours daily measure- ment period. However, further research is needed to explore the specific time thresholds which are associated with negative effects of sedentary behaviour.",
    "Therefore, we also conducted a sensitivity analysis using the 6 hours cut- off, which indicated costs of EUR1.7 billion, instead of EUR1.5 billion. In addition, missing RR for depression in physical activity was replaced by OR. The latter one is known to overestimate the RR when both estimates are over 1, and therefore the total annual cost of physical activity is estimated to be 1%-5% too high.36 The calculations of healthcare costs were based on some assumptions as well.",
    "First, no register is error- free but contains some misclassifications, although the healthcare registers in Nordic countries are generally regarded fairly reliable.37 Second, some non- communicable diseases (eg, type 2 diabetes) can increase the risk of another non- communicable disease (eg, coro- nary artery disease). Therefore, it is possible that some costs for healthcare visits were calculated twice. In the present study, we tried to reduce double- counting by subtracting 30% from the direct costs of type 2 diabetes.22 Third, the RRs used to calcu- late the costs were based on several international meta- analyses, whereas the actual RRs for certain diseases in the Finnish popu- lation could be somewhat different.",
    "Similar approaches have been proposed elsewhere.4 9 Another possibility could be the use of Finnish cohort studies, but the lack of statistical power would be the case in several non- communicable diseases of lower prev- alence.",
    "That directed us to use the methods that has been widely used in this type of calculations.4 9 Fourth, the prevalence of physical inactivity used to calculate the direct costs was based on accelerometer- measured data from a population sample of Finnish adults. Therefore, the prevalence of physical inactivity in our study differs from earlier estimates based on self- reports.9 Self- reported physical activity likely underestimates the actual prevalence of physical inactivity, because the accelerometer measurements, diaries or questionnaires do not provide inter- changeable results.38 Further, physically inactive persons may take part in this type of studies less likely than physically active persons. Therefore, in the sensitivity analysis, we also employed a somewhat higher proportion (85%) of physically inactive adults, while the precise prevalence of physical inactivity in the Finnish population remains unknown.35 Strengths of the study The core strength of the study lies in including several population- based data sets that enabled examining with both accelerometer- measured and self- reported information on low physical activity and high sedentariness. In addition, Finnish national registries provide reliable information on the use of healthcare services and indirect productivity and labour market costs.",
    "These factors increased the accuracy of our estimates of the direct and indi- rect costs of low physical activity and high sedentary behaviour, while our multidimensional approach can be considered a major advantage over prior studies, most of which relied only on healthcare costs. While our work supports understanding the phenomenon as a range of costs, one can clearly conclude that low physical activity and high sedentary behaviour together cost society several billion euros every year.",
    "The costs are expected to only increase, because of ageing population, coupled with increased prevalence of some non- communicable diseases, depression and type 2 diabetes among them.29 Regarding the generalisability of these results, we are persuaded to believe that the findings can be generalised to other developed European countries. This is because physical activity behaviour and labour market participation are rather similar among Europeans, and Europeans also have similar labour market institutions.39 In conclusion, the cumulative direct and indirect costs attrib- utable to low physical activity and high sedentary behaviour levels are substantial. The key finding from our novel approach was that the indirect costs were more than three times the direct costs.",
    "Hence, it is all the more likely that effective actions aimed at increasing population- wide levels of physical activity would yield considerable savings for society. For example, our results suggest that increasing the proportion of people in Finland who meet the physical activity recommendation from 23% to 50% would create annual savings of about EUR1 billion. While an activity increase of this magnitude has not yet been witnessed at the population level, in theory, this is not an overwhelming demand, since the recommended minimum of 150 min moderate- to- vigorous physical activity per week for adults is quite reasonable.",
    "It demands only 2% of one's waking hours, or about 20 minutes a day, with 8 hours still left for sleep. Furthermore, were the percentage of people who are sedentary for more than 8 waking hours a day to fall from 83% to 70%, the annual savings would be EUR235 million.

    "Page 2 Background--The U.S. Office for Human Research Protections has proposed that end points of randomized trials comparing the effectiveness of standard medical practices are risks of research that would require disclosure and written informed consent, but data are lacking on the views of potential participants. Objective--To assess attitudes of U.S. adults about risks and preferences for notification and consent for research on medical practices.",
    "Design--Cross-sectional survey conducted in August 2014. Setting--Web-based questionnaire. Patients--1095 U.S. adults sampled from an online panel (n = 805) and an online convenience river sample (n = 290).",
    "Measurements--Attitudes toward risk, informed consent, and willingness to participate in 3 research scenarios involving medical record review and randomization of usual medical practices. Results--97% of respondents agreed that health systems should evaluate standard treatments. Most wanted to be asked for permission to participate in each of 3 scenarios (range, 75.2% to 80.4%), even if it involved only medical record review, but most would accept nonwritten (oral) permission or general notification if obtaining written permission would make the research too difficult to conduct (range, 70.2% to 82.7%).",
    "Most perceived additional risk from each scenario (range, 64.0% to 81.6%). Limitation--Use of hypothetical scenarios and a nonprobability sample that was not fully representative of the U.S. population. Conclusion--Most respondents preferred to be asked for permission to participate in observational and randomized research evaluating usual medical practices, but they are willing to accept less elaborate approaches than written consent if research would otherwise be impracticable. These attitudes are not aligned with proposed regulatory guidance.",
    "Primary Funding Source--National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences at the National Institutes of Health. The emergence of studies conducted in health care settings that blur the distinction between research and clinical practice has fanned a debate (1-5) that began in March 2013 when the U.S. Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) criticized a study (6) comparing target oxygen saturation levels in premature infants (7).",
    "The debate revolves around which risks should be attributed to research that compares 2 or more commonly used clinical practices by randomly assigning participants between them. On 24 October 2014, the OHRP announced draft guidance clarifying that, for studies that compare treatments and randomly assign patients, the risks of the treatments should be considered risks of research and disclosed as such (8). But many large ongoing studies of this type, such as those conducted by the National Institutes of Health Collaboratory (9), have not required such disclosures; indeed documented informed consent for such studies may be prohibitively difficult or logistically impossible. According to OHRP, however, in observational studies that compare 2 treatments chosen by clinicians and their patients, the risks of treatment are not considered Ann Intern Med.",
    "Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 March 03. AuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscript Cho et al.",
    "Page 3 to be risks of research and thus are not currently required to be disclosed in the informed consent process (6, 10). Research on medical practices (ROMP) poses challenges for the protection of human subjects and informed consent. For such research, which is typically conducted in the context of patients receiving care from their physicians, the assessment of risk and approach to informed consent can differ from research that tests new interventions or that is conducted by researchers not providing care to the patient participants (11-14).",
    "Current regulations in the United States instruct institutional review boards (IRBs) to \"consider only those risks and benefits that may result from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies subjects would receive even if not participating in the research)\" (10). Further, the current regulatory framework uses risk categorization to drive specific approaches to informed consent (15, 16). For example, the ability to alter or waive informed consent is only possible for research that \"involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects\" (17).",
    "But the draft guidance defines the risks associated with the standard treatments being evaluated as risks of research if \"a standard of care that at least some of the individual subjects will be assigned to receive will be different from the standard of care that they would have received if they were not participating in the study;\" further, the guidance requires that these risks must be disclosed to participants (8). The draft guidance is intended to assist institutional review boards in interpreting federal regulations. It may, however, run counter to the ethical principle of respect for persons underlying the regulations to the extent that it takes a narrow view of participant preferences, values, and concerns about research, especially with how participants weigh and balance benefits of research relative to perceived risks (15).",
    "Framing the guidance more appropriately is difficult given the absence of data about the views of potential participants. Empirical data can contribute to normative and policy deliberations by examination of how the public considers the risks of randomization and how the public makes tradeoffs between preferences for notification or permission to participate and the ability of researchers to conduct ROMP.",
    "We therefore conducted a survey among a sample of U.S. adults to assess these issues in the context of hypothetical research scenarios involving observational or randomized studies of standard medical practices. Methods Overview We conducted a Web-based survey to assess attitudes about ROMP in August 2014.",
    "To explain key features of ROMP, we developed 3 narrative videos that were embedded in the survey. We developed the survey questionnaire and pilot-tested the videos using focus groups.",
    "This study was approved by the University of Washington and Stanford University Institutional Review Boards. Ann Intern Med.",
    "Sample Selection Page 4 Our sample was obtained from Research Now and derived from members of an online research panel and a \"river\" (convenience) sample of Internet users invited to participate when visiting general, social media, and loyalty Web sites. Panel members received a small incentive by a points-based reward program, and their identity was validated by detection of a unique computer ID. Multiple survey completions were avoided by use of a unique URL for each survey. Quota sampling was used to ensure inclusion of key population subgroups by geography (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West), gender, age, race, and ethnicity.",
    "Development of Narrative Videos Because this type of research is not familiar to most people, we created 3 animated narrative videos (with Alex Thomas, MD, and health communication specialist Gary Ashwal, both of Booster Shot Media), each 2 to 3 minutes long, that focused on the variability in use of approved antihypertension medications and research to learn which treatments are better. With Booster Shot Media, the research team identified key concepts about ROMP that distinguish it from other clinical research and were addressed in the survey. On the basis of these concepts, Booster Shot Media developed storyboards, scripts, and draft videos, each of which was revised in collaboration with the research team.",
    "We showed the videos as part of the focus groups and solicited feedback to inform revisions for clarity (for example, we slowed the narration in response to comments that it was too fast) and overcome common misconceptions (for example, that medical research only compares treatments with placebo, rather than with each other). The first video explains factors that influence variation in clinical practice, the second explains randomization and medical record review, and the third explains 3 approaches to notifying patients about research and obtaining their permission to participate. We used conventional terms for notification (\"general information\"), oral permission (\"verbal permission\"), and written consent (\"written agreement\").",
    "We described the spectrum of medical record review and randomization comparing usual treatments as \"research on medical practices\" because such terms as \"learning health systems,\" \"comparative effectiveness research,\" and \"pragmatic trials\" are not commonly used by the public. We believed that \"research on medical practices\" was more descriptive, which was confirmed in our focus groups.",
    "Survey Development and Administration To develop the survey, we conducted 8 focus groups of 4 to 7 participants each and 2 small- group interviews of 2 to 3 participants each; participants were recruited from clinics at 3 health care institutions. We revised the survey on the basis of review by expert consultants and through 13 cognitive interviews of participants derived from the focus group sampling frame and patrons of a public library by using the \"think aloud\" technique (18).",
    "The survey began with questions about attitudes toward research, physicians, and health systems, interspersed with the 3 videos and questions to assess understanding of ROMP concepts. The second section asked questions about preferences for notification and permission to enroll in ROMP, perceptions of risk, and willingness to participate in ROMP in the context of 3 scenarios.",
    "The first scenario described a medical record review comparing the outcomes of 3 medications in patients newly diagnosed with hypertension, Ann Intern Med. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 March 03. AuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscript Cho et al.",
    "Page 5 with the medications being described as approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and prescribed on the basis of physician judgment and patient preferences. The second scenario described a variant of the first scenario in which patients were randomly assigned to one of these medications, in an unblinded manner, with usual clinical follow-up. The scenario stated that \"the doctor will not change the [assigned] medication unless the doctor or patient has concerns.\"",
    "The third scenario described a similar randomized study comparing 3 medications for \"a more serious condition that increases your risk for stroke.\" The last section of the survey consisted of questions about demographic characteristics and prior experience with health care for serious illness and clinical research.",
    "The videos (19-21) and the survey instrument (22) are available at the ROMP Ethics Study Web site (https://rompethics.iths.org/). Readers are invited to take the online survey (http://trn.co1.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_3vISKwFfRV1LV53) from 14 April 2015 to 18 August 2015.",
    "Selected survey questions and descriptive data on responses are provided in Appendix Table 1 (available at www.annals.org). Participants from the research panel and river sample were invited to take the survey and were sent a single e-mail that contained a link to the survey Web site. Statistical Analysis Sample characteristics are shown in Table 1 alongside data from the U.S. Census Bureau (23) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Health Interview Survey (24). The survey required a response to all items, with the exception that respondents were given the option of \"prefer not to answer\" for the questions about household income and education. Estimates of sampling error could not be calculated because both samples are made up of volunteers only; therefore, the probabilities of selection and thus response rates cannot be calculated because the sampling frame is unknown (25).",

The funding source did not participate in the design, conduct, or analysis of the study or in the decision to submit the manuscript for publication.",
    "Results Respondent Characteristics Demographic characteristics of survey respondents are shown in Table 1 and Appendix Table 2 (available at www.annals.org).",
    "Of the 1095 completed survey responses we received, 805 were from the panel and 290 were from the river sample. Results are reported for the combined group of respondents from the panel and river samples, with no weighting or adjustments applied.",
    "We report the response metrics currently recommended for online surveys (25, 26). The completion rate representing all respondents who attempted to complete a survey even if they were screened out was 41.6% (1335 of 3208 respondents) for the panel survey and 90.1% (472 of 524 respondents) for the river survey.",
    "The study- specific eligibility rate is equivalent to Response Rate 6 as defined by the American Association for Public Opinion Research for a study-specific sample (27). The eligibility rate was 60.3% (805 completed surveys/[805 completed + 530 screened out]) in the panel Ann Intern Med.",
    "Page 6 survey and 61.2% (289 completed surveys/[289 completed + 183 screened out]) in the river survey. Demographic characteristics (geography, gender, age, race, and ethnicity) of respondents differed from those reported in the 2013 U.S. Census data (23) in that our sample had a lower proportion of Asian Americans, fewer respondents in the 21- to 26-year age group years but more in the 27- to 44-year age group, and respondents with higher average educational level and household income (23). Self-reported health status was somewhat poorer in our sample relative to the national average, with smaller percentages of our sample reporting excellent or very good health (24); 95.4% and 85.0% of respondents trusted their physicians and health systems, respectively, to put their well-being above all other considerations (Appendix Table 1).",
    "Respondents correctly answered a mean of 5.04 of the 6 questions about understanding of ROMP (84%) (Appendix Table 1). The percentage of respondents answering all 6 questions correctly ranged from 76.5% to 95.3%.",
    "Support for ROMP Respondents showed strong support for research to determine which standard treatments are best; 97% agreed (74.3% strongly) that health systems should conduct this type of research (Table 2), and 92.8% indicated that it was always (15.3%), usually (46.4%), or sometimes (31.1%) acceptable for health systems to use randomization to compare how well standard treatments work. However, 75.4% had not participated in a randomized clinical study (Appendix Table 1).",
    "Preferences for Notification or Permission to Participate in ROMP Most respondents preferred to have a discussion with their provider followed by either written or oral permission to participate in each of the 3 ROMP scenarios (Table 3). The proportions of respondents who indicated a preference for written permission for each of the 3 scenarios were similar: 51.0% for the medical record review scenario, 47.2% for the hypertension scenario, and 52.4% for the more serious condition scenario. The proportions of respondents who indicated a preference for written permission for the randomized scenario of the more serious condition (52.4%) and the medical record review (51.0%) or randomized hypertension (47.2%) scenarios were very similar. To assess these preferences relative to the ability to conduct research among respondents who initially indicated a preference for either discussion plus oral or written permission, we further measured their preferences if getting permission in one form or the other \"would make this research too difficult to carry out.\"",
    "One of the response options provided was, \"I would prefer that the research not be conducted\" (Table 4). For all 3 scenarios, most preferred a less demanding approach rather than the research not being conducted. Most respondents who preferred written or oral permission for each of the 3 scenarios still supported doing research if permission was too difficult to obtain, although more indicated a preference that research not be conducted for the randomized study of the more serious condition (37.2%) or hypertension (31.8%) than research using medical records (26.8%) (Table 5).",
    "Ann Intern Med. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 March 03. AuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscript Cho et al.",
    "Page 7 Of participants surveyed, 84.5% preferred that they be asked permission to participate in the medical records review study by their physician as opposed to by a researcher or research nurse not involved in their care, whereas 85.2% preferred their physician in the hypertension scenario and 86.8% in the more serious condition scenario (see survey questions 12, 21, and 35 in Appendix Table 1). Perceptions of Risk and Willingness to Participate in ROMP In general, most respondents perceived \"a little\" more risk with each scenario than with \"just having their doctor prescribe the medications\" (Table 6). A higher percentage perceived the risks of ROMP to be \"a lot\" more with randomization for hypertension or a serious condition than for medical record review, and a higher percentage perceived no additional risk from research using medical record review than from randomized studies. In addition, whereas most respondents were willing to participate in all 3 scenarios, more indicated a willingness to participate in the medical record review scenario than the randomized studies for hypertension or a more serious condition (Table 6).",
    "Discussion Almost all respondents to our survey supported ROMP, including the use of randomization, and were willing to participate in such research. Most, however, wanted to be asked for their permission to participate.",
    "Of note, the percentage preferring written permission for research using medical records was almost as high as that for scenarios involving randomization. This suggests that persons want to be asked for permission to participate in such research regardless of whether it affects treatment decisions. These findings are consistent with other studies that reveal broad support for, and willingness to participate in, research (27) but also a strong desire to be asked for permission before research using medical records (28), biospecimens (29, 30), or cluster randomization (31). These data also suggest that, unlike the OHRP's interpretation of the federal regulations, the public does not base disclosure preferences about research solely on whether the research plan determines treatment assignment.",
    "In addition, the expressed preference for permission to be obtained by physicians rather than researchers not involved in care seems contrary to the regulatory requirement that \"investigators\" obtain informed consent (32). Given the widespread preference among our sample for being asked permission to participate in both randomized and nonrandomized ROMP, we were surprised to find that, when asked to choose between less demanding approaches to consent or precluding research from being done, most respondents were willing to accept less demanding approaches.",
    "Fewer even preferred notification through the receipt of general information, without express permission, over not allowing the research to proceed. This suggests that preferences are contextual or contingent upon certain conditions being met; although persons value both research and the ability to agree to or decline participation in studies, such as those described in our scenarios, many prioritize the former over the latter. Thus, in cases in which conducting research with particular informed consent requirements may be impractical, such as written documentation, most respondents preferred that the research go forward.",
    "Ann Intern Med. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 March 03. AuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscript Cho et al. Page 8",
    "The finding that most respondents thought there was at least a little more risk from research than usual clinical care, even when the research involves only medical record review, suggests that persons do perceive research-specific risks in ROMP. Of note, there was only a small difference between the proportion of respondents who felt that medical record review posed \"a little more risk\" than usual care and the proportion who felt that way about the randomization scenarios. This suggests that a substantial portion of respondents do not regard the possibility of being randomly assigned to a treatment different from what they would otherwise have received as the source of the perceived risk. Again, this perception of risk from research involving only the review of medical records contrasts with the OHRP guidance, which does not consider the risks associated with standard care in an observational study to be risks of research (6). But we do not know the nature of the risks that respondents might have envisioned as they considered the 3 scenarios.",
    "Our study has some limitations. First, our survey asked about hypothetical scenarios, so notification and permission preferences and willingness to participate in actual situations may differ.",
    "Second, we cannot assess the effects of nonresponse bias due to our sampling method. We chose our sampling method to obtain an overall sample with diversity in geography, age, gender, race, and ethnicity. But our sample differed somewhat from the general U.S. population in terms of race, age, income, education, and self-reported health status.",
    "Although we do not know how our sample compares with potential participants in ROMP, at least 1 population-based study found that poor health and some college-level or higher education were predictors of participation in clinical trials in general (33), suggesting that our sample may be similar to persons likely to participate in ROMP. Our findings suggest strong support for research that compares usual clinical practices to determine the best ways of treating a particular condition and willingness to participate in such research.",
    "Respondents also favored being asked for permission to participate in this research, regardless of whether it affects treatment decisions; thus our results indicate that respondents might not attribute and categorize risks in the same way as the federal regulatory draft guidance. These findings may indicate, on one hand, that federal regulations do not go far enough to ensure that research participants are informed about and asked for permission to participate in observational research, including studies of de-identified data that are currently not considered human subjects research.",
    "If requiring written permission would preclude the conduct of research, however, most persons would rather accept less elaborate notification or approaches to consent than see the research not be done; they thus seem willing to make tradeoffs between imposing full consent requirements and allowing research to proceed. If the proposed OHRP guidance is adopted, it would define potential differences in outcome as risks of research, and therefore randomized comparative effectiveness research will nearly always need to be classified as greater-than-minimal risk. Thus, the OHRP proposal seems to rule out options that many potential research participants would want to have available, such as a waiver of documentation or a waiver or alteration of consent.",
    "Although the OHRP approach could address the concerns of a consent-requiring minority, it may do so at the expense of a research-supporting majority. Fulfilling the ethical principle of respect for persons in the conduct of ROMP requires finding the appropriate balance between the Ann Intern Med.",

    "The topic is vast because it covers nanodrugs, but also excipients (that includes varying proportions of NMs) and medical devices (with intended or not-intended (by-products of wear) nanoparticles). Although researchers in the field of nanomedicines in clinical research and industry push for clearer definitions and relevant regulations, the endeavor is challenging due to the enormous diversity of NMs in use and their specific properties.",
    "In addition, regulatory hurdles and discrepancies are often cited as obstacles to the clinical development of these innovative products. The scientific council of the Agence Nationale de Securite du Medicament et des produits de sante (ANSM) undertook a multidisciplinary analysis encompassing fundamental, environmental and societal dimensions with the aim of identifying topics of interest for regulatory assessment and surveillance.",
    "This analysis allowed for proposing some recommendations for approximation and harmonization of international regulatory practices for the assessment of the risk/benefit balance of these products, considering as well the public expectations as regards efficacy and safety of nanomaterials used in Health products, in terms of human and environmental health. KEYWORDS nanomaterials, public health, regulatory science, nanomedicines, medical devices, medicines, excipients innovative drugs, Frontiers in Public Health frontiersin.org Oualikene-Gonin et al. 10.3389/fpubh.2023.1125577 Introduction A wide variety of manufactured nanomaterials (NMs) are present in a considerable number of health products (1, 2).",
    "Because of their nanometric size, they have particular properties that are exploited for maximizing efficacy and reducing dose and toxicity. This can be done along different lines such as drug targeting, controlled and site-specific release, preferential distribution in the body (e.g., in areas with cancerous lesions), or improved transport across biological barriers (1).",
    "They may also have specific risks and toxicity (2). As complex and innovative products, they pose public health challenges to the whole society and to regulatory agencies in charge of clinical trial or marketing authorizations (3, 4).",
    "Indeed, in addition to nanomedicine products, nanotechnology may be involved in medical devices (MDs), and conventional excipients. Because of the impact on regulatory assessment and surveillance, and its public health importance, the scientific board of ANSM decided to tackle the topic of nanotechnologies in health products from fundamental to environmental and societal dimensions. In general, for medicines, the main questions are those related to pharmaceutical quality, efficacy and non-clinical and clinical safety, in order to establish the risk-benefit balance for marketing authorization.",
    "Subsequently, it is necessary to use relevant vigilance tools for a continuous risk-benefit assessment approach. These steps should be adapted to all health products enabled with nanotechnology also because NMs are a concern to the general public (5).",
    "The use of NMs in many fields (clothing, food, cosmetics), has undeniably led to questions from the public about these technologies (6). The regulatory landscape is sketchy with very few guidance and consensus definitions (7), although a new guidance was recently issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (8). Outlining the main challenging points and unknowns for regulatory assessment and surveillance, taking also into account societal and environmental questions in the larger context of public health, recommendations are proposed for approximation or harmonization of regulatory approaches, considering all the items that are to be assessed before and after marketing authorization. Some scientific gaps were also identified, which could help define relevant and useful assays and methods to achieve streamlined and straightforward regulatory assessment processes. This is an initiative in line with recent efforts to level translational gaps through contact with regulators and regulatory science development (9).",
    "Challenging points in regulatory assessment and surveillance to the According recommendation of the European Commission (10), the definition of a nanomaterial is generally applied for excipients and MDs, while nanomedicines have active ingredients or part of the active ingredient (e.g., vector) and a more specific definition. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) criteria for a nanoparticle used in a drug are systems manufactured for clinical applications, having at least one component in the nanoscale and having specific properties giving them a clinical advantage related to nanoengineering and size (7). We can therefore distinguish: - Medicines designed deliberately at the nanoscale called \"nanodrugs\" or \"nanomedicines\" with the aim of crossing physiological barriers and bringing active substances more quickly and/or more precisely into the body), which may also help reduce toxicity. Products concerned are mainly nanomedicines and some MDs.",
    "- Medicinal products containing NMs without direct therapeutic purposes with multiple uses (such as opacifier, instance, dye, UV protection, etc.). These include for conventional excipients (that may harbor a proportion of NMs) and by-products of MDs wear. Pharmaceutical quality of nanodrugs At the moment, quality assessments are made on a case-by-case basis (11), allowing authorities to require any additional data that may be needed to perform a complete and thorough assessment (3).",
    "Quality-by-design approaches are also being encouraged and developed for NMs used in health products (4, 12, 13). Knowledge is not yet exhaustive, limitations exist in current methods of analysis, control and metrology (14).",
    "Overall, important points of attention in relation to the pharmaceutical quality of nanoparticle size compounds are to be highlighted: * Development, identification, and standardization of relevant and adapted characterization methods.",
    "The development and standardization of missing methods has been taken into account by the European Commission Joint Research Center REFINE project (14) and aims to benefit from the joint efforts of method developers and standardization communities. * Definitionof regulatory expected characterizations and critical quality attributes as well as critical process parameters are required [quality-by-design (4, 15)].",
    "standardson Non-clinical studies of nanodrugs The \"conventional\" toxicological approach proposed by the current guidelines for drugs in general (International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH), FDA, EMA) is applicable. Nevertheless, in general, existing methods may be improved: * Regarding genotoxicity, the in vitro Ames test assay, which did provide false negatives after challenge with NMs (sometimes NMs simply does not enter the bacterium and therefore has no effect) has been considered not relevant for assessing mutagenicity (16). The Nanogenotox project (17) has made it possible to point out the difficulty of obtaining the same results Frontiers in Public Health frontiersin.org Oualikene-Gonin et al. 10.3389/fpubh.2023.1125577 between different laboratories, on the characterization of NMs sizes, but also on the effects observed.",
    "marketed European medicinal drug products up to 50% in concentration (28). * Carcinogenicity studies, which are only mandatory if the drug is given in the long term, are long studies (about 2 years). For some NMs (e.g., nickel NMs), carcinogenicity mechanisms are not fully understood and specific methods must be defined and validated (18).",
    "* For immunotoxicity, it is known that NMs can interact with the immune system leading to immune reactions with an impact on the efficacy and/or safety of the medicinal product (19). Indeed, cases of CARPA syndrome (a pseudo-allergy syndrome related to complement C-activation) which have occurred with several NMs systems, have been reported (20). At present, there is no specific regulatory framework (15, 21).",
    "New models, eventually leading to new regulatory standards, need to be developed (15). It is also noteworthy that the EU Horizon 2020 project REFINE has recently developed a Decision Support System (DSS) to help stakeholders with relevant testing strategies for efficient preclinical assessment of nanotechnology-enabled products. This DSS helps developers and regulators to prioritize assays to be performed, especially regarding immunotoxicological endpoints for efficient preclinical assessment of nano-enabled products (22).",
    "Nanosimilars Made in the same spirit as generic drugs, they can be considered as generic nanomedicines (14). Comparability reference documents for generic drugs have been written in a multidisciplinary manner with quality, non-clinical and clinical experts. In the case of similar NMs, and this is different from what is done for generics, it must be demonstrated that pharmacokinetics (in vivo models) and elimination are similar.",
    "Differences in liposome characteristics may not be detectable by conventional bioequivalence tests alone and that further studies are needed (23). The European Commission's Joint Research Center recommends drawing inspiration from what has been done for biosimilars to develop a generic nanodrug regulatory approach (14).",
    "R(cid:13)in In nanosimilars, every difference, even a small one, manufacturing can have an impact on these properties, especially R(cid:13) pharmacokinetics and pharmacodistribution such as for Doxil which are liposomal solutions containing the same and Lipodox qualitative and quantitative compositions. (24-26).",
    "The actions to be taken could be of developing new models that are more relevant in terms of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodistribution and in general models for determining the equivalence of nanosimilars. Then the other component would concern the evolution of regulatory approaches according to these new models, drawing on what has been done for biosimilars (27).",
    "Excipients Some food additives at the nanoscale size, authorized byin European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), can be present Currently, the main topic in the field of nanoparticle excipients is that titanium dioxide used as food additive (E171) is widely used in drugs and cosmetics, and has recently been banned from use in food in Europe (28). In the EU, the question hence arises of its maintenance in health products. In Europe, around 8,000 pharmaceutical marketed drugs are concerned frequently for oral solid forms (29).",
    "It should be noted that discussions are also ongoing for other R(cid:13) dyes such as E172 [red, iron-based (30)], and silicates [Aerosil (31)] which contain nanoparticle forms. The interest of the nanoscale excipients used in various drugs in terms of stability, resistance to light but also in terms of patient compliance (color and physical aspect of the administered forms) have to be analyzed considering potential risks and doubt arising from the nanoscale.",
    "Clinical assessment The benefit risk balance assessment for these products is similar to others with clinical trials and vigilance activities. Adverse effects related to nanodrugs such as pseudo-allergies (or CARPA syndromes) and immunotoxicological effects are the main that have been previously reported with nanomedicines (2, 20). Comparison of side-effects of drugs formulated with nanoparticle or not, showed induction of pseudo-allergic responses associated with NMs.",
    "As different compounds were involved, size is undoubtedly a factor (19). More research is needed to determine whether some specific classes of compounds are involved.",
    "Potential risks are therefore essentially related to immunotoxicological effects (2). These potential risks are therefore to be considered when establishing the benefit risk balance.",
    "Medical devices (MDs) MDs products may intentionally and intrinsically contain NMs or they can release (by wear or other mechanism) particles, some of which may be nanoparticular in size. Indeed, NMs can be added for different reasons, for example to confer new properties (surface coatings, imaging), but can also be the unintended consequences of wear that can lead to particle releases, some of which are at the nanoscale (32, 33). Since the recent entry into force of the Regulation on MDs (Regulation (EU) 2017/745) (34), NMs in MDs are now regulated, and this regulation uses the classic definition of a nanomaterial from the 2022 EC Recommendation (10). The European Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) has also published a recommendation on the use of NMs in MDs, including information on risk assessments specifically for these NMs (35).",
    "From the new regulation and the conclusions of SCENIHR, it can be outlined: * That no identification of NMs composing MDs is laid down in the Regulation. As the provision on the Frontiers in Public Health frontiersin.org Oualikene-Gonin et al. 10.3389/fpubh.2023.1125577 it is not possible to identify regulation currently stands, MDs containing NMs. This has implications for MDs surveillance (materiovigilance and surveillance epidemiology) and transparency.",
    "combined with the uncertainty that affects knowledge about its medium- and long-term effects on living organisms and the environment, maintain public mistrust and the awareness of scientific communities (6). *",
    "Evaluation and models do not consider the aging of MDs (even if this point is included in the ISO 10993-22 standard). The models used to assess the release of nanoparticles from MDs do not sufficiently consider the aging of MDs (even if the characterization of nanoparticles is well-described in the ISO 10993-22 standard). Indeed, existing models do not sufficiently take into account the exact MD implantation site with its environment and its duration of implantation in the organism.",
    "A case-by-case approach is still needed for the risk assessment of MDs as no currently available test method has been validated specifically for NMs. The application of such tests will have to be done on a case-by-case basis with a particular adaptation to the specificities of NMs according to the use for which they are intended.",
    "Surveillance of health products After marketing, health products containing NMs, like any other, are subject to constant monitoring. Adverse drug reporting may be done by health professionals or patients as any other product and allow to detect signal. In the case of detection of a signal, retrospective epidemiological studies may allow to confirm this signal or not.",
    "All this surveillance is based on the product and each of its components (such as excipients). Therefore, epidemiological studies are important tools for the surveillance of health products. However, for the surveillance of product with nanoparticles, for instance as an excipient, it is necessary to know all products containing nanoparticles and their characteristics.",
    "For MDs, they may intentionally contain intentional NMs or release them due to wear and tear. In both cases, in order to ensure materiovigilance, it would be desirable to ensure traceability.",
    "In the case of unintentional release, it is more specifically a question of also stimulating specific research, or even the development of relevant models to predict the consequences of these releases in the long term. This would also be useful to initiate surveillance studies on the consequences of unintentional releases of NMs by certain MDs.",
    "Pharmacovigilance as it exists makes it possible to detect could confirm for products deployed on large and epidemiological especially studies consequences and quantify population scales. Common adverse effects related to NMs and not to the active substance may be identify. Therefore, it would be essential to identify products with the presence (nature and quantity) of each type of NMs to ensure health products containing NMs surveillance.",
    "Societal topics The novelty of the object, the supposed unpredictability of its reactions and interactions in its changes in form and properties, The debates surrounding the use of NMs in medicine are part of a broader framework, that of the controversies over nanotechnologies (36). It seems important to assess acceptability and to implement measures to raise awareness of the applications, uses and benefits of these technologies (37).",
    "The European Chemical Agency (ECHA) carried out a study in 2020 on the public perception of NMs and their safety in the EU (38). Although awareness of the presence of NMs in marketed products increased between 2005 and 2020 (from 43 to 65% of those surveyed), the general public's understanding of their use is very limited. When people have information about the presence of a nanomaterial in a product, most (62%) consider them as not as safe as products not containing NMs, avoid it, and determine themselves based on the product category.",
    "People are more suspicious of food, health products, and cosmetics. However, they are more confident (half of them) in NM-containing health products than in products of other categories.",
    "Overall, consumers' perception of risk is highly dependent on the applications of the products concerned. As a result, exposure to NMs in sunscreens, drugs or cosmetics is considered riskier by the public than in electronic products (zero or lower exposure).",
    "For example, two- thirds of respondents are concerned about direct contact with NMs. It should also be noted that 87% of respondents considered that they should know when they buy a product containing a nanomaterial. Patient organizations are alerting the European Commission and have made recommendations for better information on applications, benefits and risks and greater traceability about NMs in health products (39, 40).",
    "Their demands also concern the protection of the environment and health. Thus, understanding the use of nanoparticle formsin health products is very complex for the public.",
    "This is easily understandable due to the wide variety of products and applications but also because of different definitions and regulations depending on the product. The fact that traceability and systematic labeling are not mandatory can contribute to mistrust.",
    "Nanotechnology debates and concerns in societies exemplify as well the relationship that Americans and Europeans have with such innovations and provides a relevant focus for a renewed analysis of democracy (41). Environmental topics Regarding ecotoxicological effects, research has highlighted potential risks of NMs to invertebrates and fish, including effects on behavior, reproduction and development (27, 42). Thus, NMs -health products are likely to affect the different physical (atmosphere, water, soil, sediment) or biological compartments of the environment.",
    "The study of the fate and behavior of NMs in health products, such as their interaction with different compartments, including living organisms, their bioavailability, bioaccumulation, biodegradation as well as the modification of their physicochemical properties is an important task to deal with. This approach Frontiers in Public Health frontiersin.org Oualikene-Gonin et al. 10.3389/fpubh.2023.1125577 is currently, as for any drug, carried out by applying the usual tests recommended in the document \"Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use\" EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 (43) on the assessment of the environmental risk of medicinal products based on a control of the physicochemical properties of nanomedicines. Research on the impact of eliminating drugs and their degradation products, including possible NMs, in the environment, was considered insufficient (44). Most of the studies and work carried out to date concern the risks of NMs in food, following occupational exposures and in the environment.",
    "As such,in France, Agence Nationale Securite Sanitaire Alimentaire Nationale (ANSES) and Institut national de l'environnement industriel et des risques (INERIS) have carried out a great deal of work, relying in particular on the use of data from the R-nano register (45), which compiles the mandatory declarations of these products. Actionable recommendations and perspective The current burst of technologies and possibilities in the nanotechnology field is close to the one which prevailed in previous years with classical chemistry and, more recently, with some biologicals.",
    "Processes and regulations must therefore adapt to these new paradigms. In this respect, four main areas were identified. i)",
    "The first one relates to accessibility to clinical research. Because of their specific properties, NMs are challenging for their characterization and mass production.",
    "Defining regulatory standards and critical quality attributes (preferred approach as well as that of quality-by-design), as well as specific non-clinical tests seems of paramount importance. In the longer term, this will make it possible to harmonize in successive stages the international regulations applicable to NMs in health products.",
    "It would therefore as well be interesting to recommend the implementation of a European workshop, like the one that took place about 10 years ago (46), to study the possible need for new recommendations. Work should also be done to harmonize regulations at the international level to facilitate patients' access to these health innovations.",
    "To do this, it is necessary to mobilize existing ICH working groups on these specific nano-related topics, via the EMA, and building on the ongoing work [European Nanomedicine Characterization Laboratory (EU NCL), US-NCL, Joint Research Center (JRC), International Pharmaceutical Regulators Programme Nanomedicine Working Group (IPRP)]. ii)",
    "The second main identified area relates to risk-benefit balance determination and clinical research. It encompasses a wider field that includes also traditional excipients (authorized in Europe as food additive) that contain NMs, and other nanoparticle- concerned products. A risk assessment methodology is proposed (Table 1).",
    "When it comes to carrying out surveillance studies, ensuring full traceability of the nanomaterial in the health product for retrospective epidemiological studies seems essential. Indeed, currently, it is quite possible to put on the market drugs containing nanoparticle forms without the exact quantity of NMs being known or traceable (case of excipients in conventional chemical drugs).

Some place estimates of the prevalence of Alzheimer's Disease at approximately 50% among individuals over the age of 85; by this reckoning an estimated 11 to 16 million people in the United States will have it by the middle of this century (Alzheimer's Association, 2007).",

    "In this article, we examine the intersection between one major policy initiative aimed at improving the quality of nursing home care--public reporting of nursing home quality--and the challenges of the high prevalence of dementia, especially severe dementia, among nursing home residents. We investigate three specific concerns: (a) that some reported measures are potentially inappropriate for nursing home residents with severe dementia, (b) that unreported aspects of quality important to nursing home residents with severe dementia may be neglected, and (c) that nursing homes may avoid admitting or retaining nursing home residents with severe dementia or will change coding practices to omit them from the measures.",
    "Dementia and Quality Improvement Dementia is generally defined as a group of disorders that cause progressive and irreversible cognitive decline. Although there are some pharmaceutical treatments that claim to slow progression for some individuals, there are no known ways of preventing the disease and its ultimate progression. Care of nursing home residents with dementia is inherently different from care of residents without dementia in several important ways.",
    "First, dementia is a terminal illness with a limited life expectancy. Cognitive and functional decline is an anticipated and expected part of the disease process.",
    "However, relative to other terminal diseases, there are significant barriers to providing appropriate care to people with end-stage dementia, including lack of recognition of dementia as a terminal illness, lack of reliable prognostic markers, and variability in survival (Sachs, Shega, & Cox-Hayley, 2004). For this reason, patients with dementia are substantially less likely than other terminal patients to be categorized as having end-stage disease or to enroll in hospice even though death may be imminent; less than 10% of all hospice patients have dementia (Alzheimer's Association, 2007). Compared with those with cancer, individuals with dementia in their last year of life are more likely to receive inappropriate care (to be restrained and to have feeding tubes) and are less likely to have a do-not-resuscitate order (Mitchell, Kiely, & Hamel, 2004).",
    "Second, nursing home residents with dementia (even at moderate stages) are a vulnerable population and at greater risk for adverse events and complications from care than their counterparts without dementia, as they often cannot articulate their concerns and preferences or monitor even basic aspects of the quality of the care they are receiving. Third, dementia is a challenging condition for caregivers. Individuals with dementia may require increased monitoring to prevent wandering or harm, may not be able to participate in their own health care and maintenance, and may be unable to recognize and acknowledge long-time caregivers. Finally, the presence of dementia complicates other types of care that may seem straightforward in individuals without dementia.",
    "In the presence of dementia, the risk-benefit ratio of treating nondementia illnesses is different in that decision-making capacity, reporting of adverse effects, and treatment adherence may all be lower (Brauner, Muir, & Sachs, 2000). Nursing home residents with dementia are therefore more likely than other residents to experience a variety of adverse events and the standards of care for these adverse events among individuals without dementia may not apply. These distinctions become most important as the dementia Med Care Res Rev. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 January 24.",
    "AuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscript Konetzka et al. Page 3 progresses into late stages; therefore, we focus in this study on nursing home residents with severe dementia. Nursing Home Compare Nursing home quality has been under scrutiny for several decades, due both to the large numbers of residents and dollars involved and to well-publicized and persistent quality problems. In the past, some of the quality problems were attributed to a lack of information about quality on which consumers could base decisions and which could inspire competition on the basis of quality.",
    "To address this lack of information about quality, in 2002, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released a publically accessible web-based guide called Nursing Home Compare (NHC), which rates nursing homes on long-stay and postacute care quality measures at all Medicare- or Medicaid-certified nursing homes (CMS, 2002). NHC began rating nursing homes based on 10 quality measures, 7 based on long-stay residents with chronic care needs (percent of residents with physical restraints, severe or moderate pain, urinary tract infection, worsening functioning, pressure sores among high-risk residents, and pressure sores among low-risk residents) and 3 based on post-acute measures (severe or moderate pain, delirium, and improvement in walking). Several chronic care measures were added within 2 years: the percent of chronic care residents who were more depressed or anxious (January 2004) and the percent of residents with unexpected weight loss (November 2004).",
    "CMS launched a six-state pilot in April 2002 in which the quality measures were publicly reported for each Medicare- or Medicaid-certified nursing home in the six pilot states (Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Ohio, Rhode Island, and Washington). Then, on November 12, 2002, NHC was launched nationally, allowing consumers to compare quality measures across nursing homes nationwide (CMS, 2002; Harris & Clauser, 2002).",
    "CMS continues to put resources into this public reporting effort, updating the reported scores, changing the interface, and raising awareness among consumers and other stakeholders. To take into account resident- and facility-level differences in risk, two strategies are used by CMS.",
    "First, exclusions are used to adjust the denominator of the measures. For example, residents who are comatose are excluded from the denominator of most of the measures, and the Weight Loss and Activities of Daily Living (ADL) measures also exclude residents who are coded as being enrolled in hospice or having end-stage disease.",
    "Second, some of the quality measures are adjusted for resident-level covariates. Importantly, none of the measures is adjusted explicitly for cognitive impairment or dementia. A study of the adequacy of risk-adjustment in NHC found that rankings of facilities by quality level using additional risk adjustment (including, for some measures, risk adjustment for impaired communication, a marker for dementia) can differ by as much as 48% from rankings based on the measures as currently reported (Mukamel, Glance, et al., 2008).",
    "Studies of the effect of NHC on resident outcomes have affirmed generally positive but modest and inconsistent effects on quality as represented by the measures reported. Several descriptive studies found improvement in most measures after NHC was launched (Castle, Med Care Res Rev. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 January 24.",
    "AuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscript Konetzka et al. Page 4 Engberg, & Liu, 2007; Zinn, Spector, Hsieh, & Mukamel, 2005). Studies that employed quasi-experimental designs to attribute changes to NHC found more modest results with improvement for only a subset of measures, most commonly pain and restraints (Mukamel, Weimer, Spector, Ladd, & Zinn, 2008; Werner, Konetzka, Stuart, et al., 2009), with one study finding no consistent improvement (Grabowski & Town, 2011). However, these modest and inconsistent average effects may be the result of considerable heterogeneity. New Contribution",
    "Although the majority of nursing home residents have dementia, and care of residents with dementia is inherently different in important ways, the consequences of public reporting for this group have not been studied before. As measured quality appears to improve modestly on average, the quality of care for residents with dementia may improve as well. However, there may be unintended and negative consequences of public reporting on nursing home residents with dementia. We investigate three specific concerns.",
    "The first concern is that nursing home report cards emphasize some outcomes that may not be appropriate for residents with dementia, especially those nearing the end of life, such that nursing homes with large proportions of residents with dementia will find it difficult to score well. The American Geriatrics Society released a position statement expressing concern about the potential unintended consequences of NHC on the care of elderly residents with terminal diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (American Geriatrics Society, 2002).",
    "They pointed to several measures that may be particularly problematic: the percent of residents with worsening functioning and the percent of residents with weight loss. These are included as quality measures under the assumption that nursing home residents should be expected to improve (or not decline) in these areas. But as these are expected outcomes of terminal illness, nursing homes with large numbers of residents with severe dementia may not fare well on these measures regardless of quality improvement efforts. On the other hand, several reported measures such as the percent of residents with pain and the percent of residents who are physically restrained are appropriate quality improvement targets for residents with dementia and may lead to improved care for them as well as for other residents.",
    "The second concern is that unmeasured or unreported quality will be ignored or may even decline as resources are diverted to those aspects of quality that are rewarded. Unreported measures of post-acute care quality, which included urinary tract infection and declining functioning, did not improve as much as the reported post-acute measures in one study of the effect of NHC on quality (Werner, Konetzka, & Kruse, 2009). The fear is that nursing home report cards may not reflect aspects of quality that are most important to residents with dementia. In a study of the chronic care population with severe cognitive impairment, for example, reduced physical restraint use due to reporting on NHC was associated with increased use of antipsychotic medications, unreported for the first 10 years of NHC (Konetzka, Brauner, Shega, & Werner, 2014).",
    "In this article, we examine two additional unreported outcomes, increased depression or anxiety and potentially preventable hospitalizations and how they change in the context of NHC. Although the percentage of residents with depression and anxiety was a validated nursing home quality measure (J. Morris et al., 2003), arguably important to nursing home Med Care Res Rev. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 January 24.",
    "AuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscript Konetzka et al. Page 5 residents with dementia, it was not included in the original launch of NHC. Another unreported quality measure that would impact on residents with late-stage dementia is rates of potentially preventable hospitalization. Lower rates may reflect better quality of care for late-stage dementia, but there is no hospitalization measure in NHC.",
    "There is increasing interest in low hospitalization rates as a marker of nursing home quality (Grabowski, O'Malley, & Barhydt, 2007; Intrator et al., 2007; Konetzka, Spector, & Limcangco, 2008; Konetzka, Spector, & Shaffer, 2004; Ouslander, Weinberg, & Phillips, 2000). For nursing home residents with dementia, the hospital presents as a foreign, hostile environment, increasing the risk of further functional decline, increasing the risk of delirium, and increasing the risk of complications through medication error on transfer back to the nursing home; thus, avoiding hospitalizations is especially important for residents with dementia (Sachs et al., 2004). Nursing homes interested in achieving low hospitalization rates presumably need to provide resources and staffing in the facility such that more adverse events could be avoided or treated in the facility and fewer transfers needed.",
    "If facilities focus quality improvement efforts on reported measures, we may see lack of commensurate improvement or even declines in quality of care for these unreported aspects of quality, for all residents and not necessarily just those with severe dementia. The third concern we examine is that nursing homes may avoid admitting or retaining residents with severe dementia due to an inability to score well on many of the reported measures.",
    "It may or may not be possible for nursing homes to change this aspect of their populations, given that there are few alternatives for individuals with severe dementia and that dementia is prevalent among potential nursing home users. Residents that enter a nursing home with little or no dementia may also progress to severe dementia over time.",
    "Nonetheless, evidence of \"cream-skimming\" has emerged in other sectors. For example, after the release of report cards for cardiac surgeons in New York, 67% of cardiac surgeons reported refusing to treat at least one patient in the preceding year who was perceived to be high risk (Burack, Impellizzeri, Homel, & Cunningham, 1999).",
    "If nursing home residents with dementia are at higher risk for poor outcomes on measured quality, and risk adjustment is not adequate, nursing homes may attempt to avoid admitting individuals with dementia. Alternatively or in addition, because residents coded as end-stage or hospice, are excluded from the reported quality measures, nursing homes have an increased incentive to code these for their sicker residents. Our specific goal is therefore to examine differential improvement on appropriate (pain, physical restraints) and potentially inappropriate (worsening functioning, weight loss) measures by dementia status; to examine whether quality in several important but unreported domains of care (increased depression or anxiety, potentially preventable hospitalizations) may have declined; and to examine whether the percent of residents with dementia or coded with end-stage disease or hospice changed after public reporting was implemented.",
    "We assess these questions using a rigorous quasiexperimental design that allows us to plausibly connect any changes over time in these outcomes to the implementation of public reporting. Med Care Res Rev. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 January 24. AuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscript Konetzka et al.",
    "Page 6 Conceptual Approach Health care providers subject to public reporting may respond by improving the quality of care they deliver, whether out of fear of losing market share or through an inherent desire to compare well with one's peers (Kolstad, 2013). However, improvement in reported scores may be heterogeneous across types of patients or aspects of quality.",
    "Holmstrom and Milgrom's theory of multitasking (Holmstrom & Milgrom, 1991), originally conceptualized in the context of optimal contracts for employee performance, predicts that providing incentives for performance in one area may harm performance in another area if a worker engages in multiple tasks. While the employer may hope that high performance on the rewarded task is correlated with high performance in other tasks, the extent to which this is true depends on whether the process of excelling on one task is largely a complement or a substitute to the process of excelling on the other task. If the two processes are complements, then the effort devoted to performance on one task is expected to spill over to performance on the other task, and an incentive directed at either task should raise overall performance. If the two processes are substitutes, then effort devoted to improving performance on one task is not likely to lead to improved performance on the other task; indeed, if the total amount of resources (or work time) is limited, performance on the second task could decline as resources are increasingly shifted toward the incentivized task.",
    "In the context of public reporting and other types of quality improvement incentives, Holmstrom and Milgrom's theory implies that measuring and rewarding quality in some areas may harm quality in other areas. The quality of health care is clearly multidimensional while quality measures and rewards for quality improvement target only some dimensions of quality. We adopt this theory in hypothesizing that NHC may have unintended negative consequences for nursing home residents with dementia.",
    "Empirical Approach To identify the effects of public reporting, we take advantage of the fact that six pilot states were subject to NHC 7 months earlier than the rest of the United States, providing a natural experiment. This enables us to employ a classic differences-in-differences model, estimating the effect of NHC on the pilot states using the rest of the nation as a control and then the effect of NHC on the rest of the United States using pilot states as a control. The estimate of interest is captured in a \"NHC\" treatment indicator that is specific to the time of implementation for nursing homes in pilot and nonpilot states.",
    "The underlying secular trend is captured in quarterly time dummies. Thus, the combined estimate is net of the underlying secular trends, strengthening the case for causal attribution to NHC.",
    "Study Population Nursing homes typically serve two populations, chronic care residents in need of assistance with functional and cognitive impairment and short-stay, post-acute residents in need of rehabilitative care following an acute hospitalization. We focus in this article on the chronic care population that is most relevant to late-stage dementia. Our quantitative analyses thus include all chronic care residents of Medicare- and/or Medicaidcertified U.S. nursing homes Med Care Res Rev. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 January 24.",

Individual measures vary in the subset of residents qualifying for inclusion. Page 7 Konetzka et al. Data We use a 1999 to 2008 panel of observations from two merged data sets, the Minimum Data Set (MDS) 2.0 and MedPAR.",
    "The MDS is collected at regular intervals for every resident in a Medicare- or Medicaid-certified nursing home regardless of individual payer source. Information is collected on residents' race, age, home ZIP code, health, physical functioning, mental status, and general well-being. These data are used by the nursing home for care planning, by governments to calculate prospective payment rates for Medicare- covered post-acute stays, and in many states for Medicaid-covered long-term care.",
    "For chronic care residents, assessments are performed on admission, quarterly, and when a significant change in status occurs. We use all assessments that qualify for inclusion in NHC and limit our sample to the same target assessments (the last assessment per resident per quarter) that CMS uses in its calculation of the chronic care quality measures to avoid overweighting sicker residents who may have more frequent assessments. The MDS is the data source used by CMS to calculate the quality measures reported on NHC.",
    "We use the technical definitions of the quality measures provided by CMS (J. Morris et al., 2003) to calculate each nursing home's quality measures for long-stay residents over the time period of the study. By recreating the quality measures from the MDS, we are able to calculate the quality measures both before and after NHC was released on the group of residents we study.",
    "The MedPAR files contain final action stay records for Medicare-covered inpatient services, with each record representing a hospital discharge. MedPAR data were used to calculate one of our measures of unreported quality (hospitalization), and were linked to MDS data using a common unique beneficiary identifier provided by CMS. Dependent Variables",
    "The quality of care in nursing homes is measured by 6 primary variables (see Table 1). We focus in this study on a subset of measures that provide variation in appropriateness for residents with dementia and reporting status during the time period of the study, though other measures are included in NHC.",
    "Pain and restraints are appropriate and reported at the initial launch of NHC; worsening functioning is reported but potentially inappropriate; weight loss is unreported at initial launch and potentially inappropriate; and both the preventable hospitalization measure and increased depression or anxiety are appropriate but unreported at the initial launch. The quality measures are reported in Nursing Home Compare as percentages, where the numerator is the number of residents who met the measure definition (e.g., the number of residents whose need for help with daily activities has increased) and the denominator is the total number residents included in the measure.",
    "We apply exclusions as defined in available technical definitions of the measures (Abt Associates, 2003). For our resident-level analyses, we define each of these quality measures as a dichotomous variable (1 if the resident Med Care Res Rev. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 January 24.",
    "AuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscript Konetzka et al. Page 8 qualifies in the measure's numerator; 0 if the resident was eligible for the measure but did not qualify for the numerator).",
    "To determine potentially preventable hospitalizations of Medicare beneficiaries, we link MDS data to MedPAR data using unique beneficiary identifiers. We define potentially preventable hospitalizations based on AHRQ's Prevention Quality Indicators project (Davies et al., 2009), which developed a set of indicators for conditions for which good outpatient care can potentially prevent the need for hospitalization or for which early intervention can prevent complications or more severe disease.",
    "These conditions have been used in the nursing home setting as well, as high-quality primary care in the nursing home can similarly prevent hospitalizations (Carter, 2003; Intrator, Zinn, & Mor, 2004). Potentially preventable hospitalizations are measured as a dichotomous variable (1 if the resident is hospitalized during a quarter, 0 otherwise). Key Independent Variables Our main independent variables are a resident-level indicator for severe dementia, a NHC indicator for when public reporting was present, and the interaction between the two.",
    "We define an indicator for severe dementia using the Cognitive Performance Score (CPS; J. N. Morris et al., 1994), a tool for categorizing cognitive impairment using MDS data that has been well-validated against other tools such as the Mini-Mental Status Exam. We follow J. N. Morris et al. (1994) in categorizing residents with a CPS of more than 4 as having severe impairment or late-stage dementia. Mild or moderate dementia is defined as a CPS of 2 to 4, and a CPS of 0 or 1 indicates the absence of dementia.",
    "We then aggregate to the facility- level percentage of residents in each category. We conduct robustness checks using several other validated approaches to identifying nursing home residents with severe dementia, including the MDSCOGS scale and the ADL-SF scale (Hartmaier, Sloane, Guess, & Koch, 1994; van der Steen et al., 2006).",
    "Because these results were qualitatively similar to results using the CPS, we present only the CPS-based results.1 The main policy variable of interest is a measure- and state-specific indicator variable for whether the measure of interest was publicly reported as part of NHC (NHC = 0) or after (NHC = 1). NHC was launched nationally in November 2002; for the six states participating in the NHC pilot program, the release date for the initial set of reported measures was April 2002, 7 months before the national launch, and we define it as such.",
    "Analysis To assess whether nursing homes residents with and without dementia experience similar improvement from NHC, we first examine descriptive trends in each outcome by dementia status. To include resident-level risk adjustors and to control for time-invariant facility-level attributes that could otherwise bias our estimates, we then use facility fixed-effects regression in a difference-in-differences framework. The difference-in-differences estimator is based on two sources of variation: an indicator for severe dementia and the timing of 1.The MDS 2.0 includes an indicator for diagnosis of dementia, but the variable is subject to missing and inconsistent data such that presence of dementia is highly underestimated.",

The coefficient on NHC reflects the change in the probability of the outcome after NHC among residents without severe dementia; the coefficient on severe dementia captures differences in the probability of triggering the outcome attributable to severe dementia status; and the interaction term captures differential changes in the probability of triggering the outcome that are attributable to NHC for residents with severe dementia over and above the change for residents without severe dementia. Finally, we assess whether nursing home practices may have changed with respect to the percent of residents in the facility with severe dementia or the coding of endstage disease and hospice status.",
    "To assess whether NHC affected these outcomes, we run facility fixed- effects regressions at the facility level, regressing the percent of residents coded as having end-stage disease or being on hospice as dependent variables on our policy indicator NHC. In these regressions, identification is based solely on whether pilot states experienced changes in these outcomes earlier than nonpilot states.",
    "On average over the entire study time, 18% of residents in a nursing home are classified as having severe or late-stage dementia (see Table 2). Figure 1 depicts descriptive trends over time in each of the six outcomes by dementia status, including the risk adjustment built in to each of the reported measures, but without additional risk adjustment.",
    "Among the appropriate and reported measures (pain and physical restraint use), large differences in the outcomes by dementia status exist at baseline (prior to 2002). Residents with severe dementia are substantially less likely to trigger the pain measure but far more likely to be physically restrained. All groups appear to improve on the pain measure after NHC is implemented in 2002, with a seemingly less steep decline for the severe dementia group.",
    "Residents with severe dementia appear to be driving the reduction in restraint use, exhibiting a steeper decline. By 2008, the gap in restraint use by dementia status narrows considerably. For the potentially inappropriate measures (ADL worsening and unexpected weight loss), the group with severe dementia is more likely to trigger the adverse outcomes both at baseline and in 2008, consistent with expectations, although the gap by dementia status Med Care Res Rev. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 January 24.",
    "Results AuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscript Konetzka et al. Page 10 narrows over time. Contrary to expectations, the largest improvement in each measure is among those with severe dementia.",
    "For the appropriate but unreported measures (increased depression or anxiety and potentially avoidable hospital admissions), evidence is mixed. Residents with moderate dementia experience higher rates of depression or anxiety than residents without dementia or with severe dementia. Trends over time in this measure look fairly flat, even though the measure was added to NHC.2",
    "For hospital admission, which is never reported on NHC, we see a slight increase at the beginning of the panel that is concentrated among those without severe dementia, and flat trends thereafter. Table 3 presents the results of the resident-level, facility fixed-effects regressions using the difference-in-differences framework.",
    "The coefficients on severe dementia reveal that residents with severe dementia do consistently worse at baseline on the potentially inappropriate measures (ADL worsening and weight loss) as well as on the appropriate restraints measure. The magnitudes of these differences are substantial: a 16 percentage- point higher probability of being physically restrained; an 8 percentagepoint higher probability of experiencing ADL worsening; and a 2 percentage-point higher probability of weight loss.",
    "There was no clear pattern of improvement under NHC; residents with severe dementia exhibited more improvement on some measures and less on others as indicated by the coefficients on the interaction term between severe dementia and NHC. The magnitudes of the interaction term can be interpreted as the differential change in the probability of triggering the outcome after NHC when a resident has severe dementia over and above residents without severe dementia, for example, residents with severe dementia experienced a 1.7 percentage-point increase in the probability of pain under NHC over and above a 1.5 percentage point decline in the probability of pain for residents without severe dementia, meaning that while residents without severe dementia experienced decreased pain, the net effect for residents with severe dementia was close to zero.",
    "In terms of unreported but appropriate outcomes, residents with severe dementia exhibited a relative decline in hospital admissions, but a relative increase in the depression/anxiety measure compared with other residents, and the net effect of NHC on these outcomes across all residents was small. Table 4 depicts the difference-in-difference estimators for facility fixed-effects regressions of the percent severe dementia, the percent moderate dementia, the percent coded as end-stage, and the percent coded as hospice. The launch of NHC had no significant effect on the percent of residents with severe dementia or moderate dementia or the percent of residents coded as being on hospice.",
    "However, there was a statistically significant increase in the percent of residents coded as having end-stage disease. The effect was modest (an increase of just over one-tenth of 1%, or about 1,800 nursing home residents) but represents a 5% increase with respect to the 2.3% of residents coded as end-stage on average. 2.Note that the increased depression/anxiety measure was removed and replaced with a depression-only measure after the time period of our analysis.",

    "Discussion Page 11 Prior to public reporting, nursing home residents with severe dementia scored worse on two out of three reported clinical quality measures than residents without severe dementia. The exception was pain, which may be due to an ascertainment bias whereby pain is not well coded in the presence of dementia (Wu, Miller, Lapane, Roy, & Mor, 2005).",
    "The tendency of residents with severe dementia to score poorly on reported measures persists regardless of whether the measure is deemed appropriate or inappropriate and even when controlling for age, gender, and a multitude of comorbidities. In response to NHC, quality of care for nursing homes residents with severe dementia did not consistently improve or worsen.",
    "The lack of relative decline among residents with severe dementia was contrary to expectations for the potentially inappropriate measures of worsening functioning and weight loss, where nursing homes could presumably do little to prevent these adverse outcomes in the presence of severe dementia. One possible explanation is that there was little change overall on these measures (regardless of dementia status).",
    "The lack of any improvement may indicate that perhaps the mechanisms to improve on these measures are either too costly or too unclear for nursing homes to pursue them. In any case, fears that nursing home residents with dementia may be harmed by the publication of the weight loss and worsening functioning measures appear to be unwarranted.",
    "Similarly, we find no strong evidence for a multitasking problem. Both the regressions and the descriptive trends reveal that while many of the quality measures converged over time by dementia status, absolute differences remain. The persistence of differences by dementia status for the reported clinical quality measures suggests that additional risk adjustment for severe dementia may be warranted, especially when the measure is of questionable appropriateness for this population. Risk-adjustment could take the form of including the CPS or an indicator for severe dementia as a covariate, similar to covariate adjustment used in some of the reported measures currently. However, because nursing homes were able to improve some of these outcomes among residents with severe dementia, additional risk-adjustment may counter quality improvement incentives.",
    "The mechanisms for this improvement need further investigation through qualitative research. In addition, additional measures that are better markers for high-quality end-of-life care may be warranted.",
    "An alternative to additional risk-adjustment would be the reporting of quality measures stratified by severe dementia status. Stratification would allow comparison of outcomes only among residents with severe dementia, eliminating the need to correctly specify the risk- adjustment equation. It could also be useful to consumers who want to search directly for a nursing home that provides high-quality care for residents with dementia.",
    "The potential disadvantage of stratification is that it would require the reporting of a duplicate set of measures, adding to the complexity of the system even as CMS is attempting to simplify it. In addition, numbers within each stratum might be too small for confidential and reliable reporting.",
    "Nonetheless, given the importance of dementia as a reason for nursing home admission, stratification is a reasonable option. Med Care Res Rev. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 January 24.",
    "AuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscriptAuthorManuscript Konetzka et al. Page 12",
    "The lack of effects of NHC on the percent of residents with severe dementia suggests that nursing homes are not avoiding residents with severe dementia (and/or is consistent with a lack of response to NHC by residents with severe dementia in terms of avoiding or switching out of nursing homes that do not score well). This indicates lack of selection behavior on the part of nursing homes, at least with respect to dementia. However, avoiding these residents may be thought of as an extreme response, as coding for end-stage disease or hospice would remove the resident from the denominator of the measures.",
    "While hospice status requires actual enrollment in hospice and involves the preferences of the resident and family, coding for end-stage disease does not. Thus, it is not surprising that we find an increase in the coding of end-stage disease in response to NHC.",
    "To the extent that the coding simply reflects an increased incentive to document accurately, this change does not necessarily reflect a gaming of the system. Alternatively, the increased coding of end-stage disease may reflect upcoding of severity to remove residents with severe dementia from the reporting pool.",
    "In late 2008, the NHC system was modified to include star ratings: separate ratings for staffing, inspections, and the clinical quality measures, plus a combined overall rating. Although the clinical quality measures still appear on NHC, they have arguably become less prominent.",
    "Furthermore, the percent of long-stay residents who lose too much weight and the percent of residents who have depressive symptoms are not included in the calculation of stars for the current 5-star system. In view of our results revealing that nursing home residents with severe dementia score consistently worse on the clinical measures, in conjunction with prior studies documenting the inadequacy of risk-adjustment, the declining emphasis on clinical outcome measures in this context is perhaps warranted. Ongoing changes to the reporting system should consider and reflect the quality of care experienced by the growing population of nursing home residents with severe dementia.",

    "The application of system dynamics modelling to environmental health decision-making and policy - a scoping review Danielle J. Currie1*, Carl Smith2 and Paul Jagals3 Abstract Background: Policy and decision-making processes are routinely challenged by the complex and dynamic nature of environmental health problems. System dynamics modelling has demonstrated considerable value across a number of different fields to help decision-makers understand and predict the dynamic behaviour of complex systems in support the development of effective policy actions. In this scoping review we investigate if, and in what contexts, system dynamics modelling is being used to inform policy or decision-making processes related to environmental health. Methods: Four electronic databases and the grey literature were systematically searched to identify studies that intersect the areas environmental health, system dynamics modelling, and decision-making.",
    "Studies identified in the initial screening were further screened for their contextual, methodological and application-related relevancy. Studies deemed 'relevant' or 'highly relevant' according to all three criteria were included in this review.",
    "Key themes related to the rationale, impact and limitation of using system dynamics in the context of environmental health decision-making and policy were analysed. Results: We identified a limited number of relevant studies (n = 15), two-thirds of which were conducted between 2011 and 2016. The majority of applications occurred in non-health related sectors (n = 9) including transportation, public utilities, water, housing, food, agriculture, and urban and regional planning. Applications were primarily targeted at micro-level (local, community or grassroots) decision-making processes (n = 9), with macro-level (national or international) decision-making to a lesser degree.",
    "There was significant heterogeneity in the stated rationales for using system dynamics and the intended impact of the system dynamics model on decision-making processes. A series of user-related, technical and application-related limitations and challenges were identified.",
    "None of the reported limitations or challenges appeared unique to the application of system dynamics within the context of environmental health problems, but rather to the use of system dynamics in general. Conclusions: This review reveals that while system dynamics modelling is increasingly being used to inform decision-making related to environmental health, applications are currently limited. Greater application of system dynamics within this context is needed before its benefits and limitations can be fully understood.

    "BMC Public Health (2018) 18:402 Page 2 of 11 Background There is growing recognition of the complexity that un- derlies environmental health problems and their manage- ment [1] and with it the need for sound environmental health policy and decision-making that embraces this complexity [2].",
    "To embrace this complexity, managers of environmental health issues must move away from reduc- tionist approaches to decision-making, as environmental health hazards are influenced by a multitude of interacting factors that may not initially appear related [3]. This can result in policy resistance, which is the tendency for pol- icies to be ineffective or have unintended consequences that create new problems or exacerbate the original prob- lem [4]. Examples include the digging of wells in South East Asia to combat diarrhoea caused by poor quality sur- face water, resulting in the largest exposure in history of a population to arsenic-contaminated groundwater [5], and making dwellings in the United Kingdom more air tight to improve household energy efficiency, resulting in in- creased indoor exposure to radon [6].",
    "Decision-makers, more than ever, are required to inte- grate scientific and expert-based evidence into decision- making. Complexity can hinder evidence-based decision- making by slowing and weakening the ways in which evi- dence is collected, interpreted and translated into action [7]. Evidence for complex problems can be lacking, limited and ambiguous, and is often presented without links to the broader context for which the evidence is required. Also, the analytical tools currently used to support evidence- based decision making, such as statistical modelling, are limited in their ability to explain causation and the effect of non-linear interactions and feedback on the behaviour of complex systems [8].",
    "Given this, there is a need to provide decision-makers with the tools necessary to understand complex environmental health issues as part of implement more scientific decision-making processes. System dynamics modelling is a problem-oriented modelling approach pioneered by Jay Forrester in the late 1950's to help corporate managers better understand industrial problems [9]. Since then, its application has expanded to fields ranging from ecology to economics. Examples of its use include modelling the dynamics of the earth's climate [10], healthcare systems [11], the food industry",
    "[12] and the military [13]. System dynamics in- volves causal mapping and the development of computer simulation to understand system behaviour. Policy and scenario options are then systematically tested to answer \"what-if\" questions [14].",
    "This allows policy-makers to experiment with their decisions before implementation in the real world. This decision-experimentation creates a learning environment in which policy makers gain a better understanding of how the system will respond to their decisions and the potential unintended conse- quences of decisions. Conventional problem solving tends to approach com- plex problems by breaking them into their component parts and examining them separately.",
    "System dynamics centres on the idea that problems exist due to the inter- actions, feedback loops and material and information de- lays among component parts within a system. System dynamics therefore focuses on the relationships between the parts rather than focusing on separate parts in isola- tion [15]. System dynamics also draws strongly on the concept of endogeneity, meaning that it seeks to find ex- planations for system behaviour by understanding the internal structure of a system rather than focusing on factors external to the system [16].",
    "For example, when trying to understand why medical errors still occur in seemingly well-managed hospital settings, the temptation is to blame the problem on individual- level factors beyond the control of the hospital, such as incompetent or lazy practitioners. An endogenous perspective would take the view that most medical er- rors are the result of a combination of systemic fac- tors such as the practitioner's patient load, training, medication labelling practices, hours worked, etc. and thus the solution lies within understanding how these factors contribute to medical errors and modifying the system to prevent errors.",
    "In this paper we review the application of system dy- namics to the management of environmental health is- sues. System dynamics has been used to understand the interactions between human health and the environment before, such as zoonotic infections [17], the relationship between air pollution, health and population growth [18], the societal costs and benefits of commuter bicyc- ling [19], the effect of land use and transport policies on health",
    "[20] and malaria control [21].",
    "However, many of these applications do not demonstrate how, or if, an un- derstanding of system dynamics can lead to better policy remains unclear and decision-making. Therefore it whether the findings of these previous applications of system dynamics have remained within the confines of academia or if they have been applied to inform real decision-making processes. Objective An increasing number of authors advocate for the use of systems thinking and system dynamics in epidemiology, public health and health service delivery [22-24], but it is unclear to what extent system dynamics has actually been used to inform policy or decision-making processes in environmental health service delivery. The objective of this review was to answer the following question \"How is system dynamics being used to inform decision- making processes related to environmental health?\"",
    "To answer this question we conducted a scoping review of the scientific and the grey literature. Currie et al. BMC Public Health (2018) 18:402",
    "Page 3 of 11 Methods We used a scoping review method because the objective of the review was to broadly explore how system dynam- ics has been used to inform environmental health decision-making processes, as opposed appraising the quality of individual studies. Scoping reviews search a wide range of research and non-research reports to un- cover the breath and extent of research and application for a particular topic [25]. The design of this study was guided by the scoping review guidelines developed by Arksey and O'Malley [26] and the recommendations proposed by Levac, et al.",
    "[27], but included an additional step where papers where re-screened based on their relevancy to objectives of this review. The result was a five-step process: formulation of an objective, identifica- tion of potentially relevant science and grey literature through a systematic search, secondary screening using a framework of relevancy-based criteria to select litera- ture the most suitable for review, recording of relevant key themes emerging from the literature, and reporting of results. Given the extent of this scoping review, we do not claim that the literature captured is an exhaustive or complete list of the scientific and grey literature on this topic, rather a representative sample of the available literature. Identifying relevant reports A systematic search of the literature in the Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science and Scopus databases was con- ducted.",
    "Following an initial broad search of the litera- ture, and in consultation with a health-science librarian, three conceptual focus areas (search themes) with asso- ciated search terms were identified: environmental health, system dynamics, and decision-making. The search terms used in combination included (\"environ- mental health\" OR \"environment and public health\" OR \"environment\") AND (\"systems thinking\" OR \"systems science\" OR \"systems approach\" OR \"systems theory\" OR \"systems analysis\" OR \"system dynamics\" OR \"dy- namic systems\") AND (\"health policy\" OR \"policy mak- ing\" OR \"decision making\" OR \"health planning\" OR \"policy\" OR \"'decision support system\" OR \"decision support techniques\" OR \"environmental policy\"). Where available, we used indexing terminology (MeSH and Emtree) that corresponded to the search terms.",
    "The search was limited to reports published in English be- tween the years 2000 and 2016. The review was limited to reports published after 2000 to reflect the significant increase in publications related to systems thinking and systems science that has occurred since then [28], as well as the rapidly-evolving nature of the field of envir- onmental health [29]. The same search terms were used in the Google search engine to similarly identify relevant grey literature. Report selection Reports captured though the search of the academic and grey literature were initially screened according to inclu- sion criteria developed for this review (Table 1).",
    "system dynamics environmental health, To ensure that the retained reports would meet the objective of this review, we developed three relevancy criteria (Table 2) to determine the strength of each paper pertaining to the three conceptual focus areas of this re-and view: decision-making. This relevancy approach was adopted because the concepts of environmental health and decision-making are broadly-defined concepts that do not lend themselves to specific inclusion criteria.",
    "Reports retained during the initial screening process were then screened according to the relevancy criteria. Reports classed as 'somewhat relevant' or 'not relevant' to one or more of the relevancy criteria were excluded from further review. Reports that were classed 'relevant' or 'highly relevant' for all three relevancy criteria were included in this re- view.",
    "For each retained report, data on the location, sec- tor of application, project objectives, link to health and type of system dynamics analysis techniques used was organised in a Microsoft Excel(r) spreadsheet. Reports were also analysed to identify key themes related to the stated rationalesthe intended impact of system dynamics modelling on decision-making, the targeted scale of decision-making and limitations and challenges associated with system dynamics modelling. for using system dynamics, Results Search findings A total of 5732 unique reports were identified by search- ing scientific databases (Fig. 1).",
    "An additional 84 publi- cations were identified through a search of the grey literature, a search of the reference lists of retained arti- cles, and the 'related articles' or 'cited by' section in the databases.

Stated rationales for using system dynamics Eleven of the publications stated one or more rationales for using system dynamics methods. Many of the stated rationale focused on the technical capabilities of system dynamics models, including their ability to identify and account for sources of uncertainty in the understanding of causal relationships [30, 31], account for long time- delays between action and effect [30], reveal the en- dogenous sources of system behaviour [32, 33], and link the dynamic effects of policy actions to system structure and behaviour [31, 34, 35]. Others focused on the pre- dictive capabilities of system dynamics models including their ability to integrating multiple types of information Currie et al.",

In these instances, the goal of the system dynamics modelling process was to compare the results of various policy scenarios to inform strategic policy de- cisions.",

Targeted scale of decision-making The review also showed that system dynamics was used to inform policy and decision making processes at two distinct levels: macro-level decision making (national or international) and the micro-level (local, community or grassroots). System dynamics was used to exclusively support micro-level decision-making processes in over half of the studies (n = 9).

    "Limitations and challenges associated with using system dynamics for environmental health decision-making Twelve reports referred to limitations and challenges as- sociated with using system dynamics modelling within the context of the problem being addressed. For the pur- pose of this review, only limitations and challenges re- lated to the process of system dynamics modelling or the overall functionality of system dynamics models were analysed. Limitations for the purposes of this re- view were grouped into three categories: limitations re- lated to those involved in the modelling process, technical limitations of system dynamics, and limitations related to the application of the results to decision- making (Table 5).",
    "Note that none of the limitations or challenges identified by the authors appeared to be re- lated specifically to the application of system dynamics to environmental health problems, but rather to the ap- plication of system dynamics in general. Discussion To our knowledge, a review of the applications of system dynamics to environmental health decision-making has not been previously conducted. Our findings suggest that the applications of system dynamics to environmen- tal health decision-making is limited given the paucity of reporting, however the applications that were found vary across many different sectors. Our review further sug- gested that the use of system dynamics in this context represents an emerging field of research and practice, with the number of studies published increasing consid- erably in the last five years. While many of the reported studies occurred within the public health or health ser- vice sectors, there were a variety of non-health-specific sectors using system dynamics to model both environ- mental and health factors. The 1986 Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion recog- nised that the promotion of health cannot be done by the health-sector alone, and that the success of health- promoting activities, such as those occurring within the field of environmental health, depend on the successful collaboration and support of many different sectors",
    "[44]. Our review strongly suggests that system dynamics can be used as a method to facilitate the integration of Currie et al. BMC Public Health (2018) 18:402",

    "[38, 40] Application-related System-wide changes are difficult to implement given the often 'siloed' nature of public governance structures 2 [41, 43] There is potential for incompatibility between the timescale of political and public decision-making and system dynamics model-building, which results in rushed and over-simplified model Obtaining decision-maker buy-in is difficult due to the disparity that exists between system dynamics' goal of identifying sources of long-term success, and political processes which focuses primarily on short-term goals and outcomes 1 [37] 1",

System dynamics not only provides direct decision- support for policy analysis, but also provides a means for understanding problems, which in turn informs the way decisions-makers navigate complex decision-making processes. This is consistent with the way in which sys- tem dynamics has been used to address complex prob- lems in other fields such as health policy [45], social care [46], strategic management",
    "[47], and transportation [48].",
    "System dynamics has been used to inform decision- making at either the micro or macro-level, with limited application targeted at decision-making across multiple levels. While this is potentially due to disconnects be- tween decision-making processes at the micro- and macro-level, it does point to a potential missed oppor- tunity. Complex environmental health problems do not respect jurisdictional boundaries, and can rarely be ad- dressed at only the local or national level. While likely not possible in all situations, the URAdapt project out- lined in Raschid-Sally, et al.",
    "[43] demonstrates the po- tential for system dynamics to be used to address environmental health problems at multiple decision- making levels. None of the reports included in this review spoke of the effectiveness of the policies or decisions that resulted from the use of system dynamics. While this is not sur- prising given the recentness of their publication and the time delays between the implementation of decisions and their effects, it does indicate a gap in the literature. Evaluations of the effectiveness of decisions or policies developed based on system dynamics models will help researchers and decision-makers evaluate the merit of using system dynamics to address complex problems. Multiple limitations and challenges associated with the application of system dynamics were discussed in the re- ports reviewed, but none were specifically directed at its feasibility for application to environmental health prob- lems.",
    "Many of the limitations, such as the level of com- plexity of the models and a lack of participant openness to challenge their mental models, were consistent with appli- cations of system dynamics in other fields [49, 50].",
    "It is worth noting that some of the identified limita- tions, such as potential unwillingness of participants to have their mental models challenged, are not necessarily limitations of system dynamics itself, but rather a limita- tion of the way it is used. While using system dynamics in a participatory learning process increases the chances that participants and stakeholders will critically reflect on their own mental models, there are no guarantees that system dynamics, or any other policy analysis process, can change deeply-held views and positions. These issues are not insurmountable, but require further research and action from both the system dynamics Currie et al.",

    "As systems approaches become more widespread and integrated into the way current and future decision-makers think about complex problems, the greater the chance that tools like system dynamics will find a receptive audience.

For instance, reports by McClure et al.",
    "[20] that examined the relationships among transportation, economic devel- opment, land use, and population health; and by Peder- cini, et al. [21] that examined the costs and benefits of various malaria control interventions, demonstrated in- teresting and novel applications of system dynamics in environmental health, but did not link the outcomes of their system dynamics models to a decision-making process. This suggests a gap between basic and applied system dynamics in environmental health and decision- making and policy.",
    "The water security model reported by El Sawah et al. [51] and the waste management model reported by Stave's [52] suggest how system dynamics could inform decision-making within the field of envir- onmental health, but these applications lacked a health or health hazard component in their model. This also re- flects a disconnect between the fields of environmental management and human health. System dynamics does have significant potential to bridge the gap between en- vironmental management and human health, however this needs further demonstration.",
    "Limitations of the review This review has several limitations that must be recog- nised when interpreting the results. First, it identified and summarized only 15 publications, all of which were varied in their rationale and scope. This heterogeneity suggests that while key common elements of the studies could be identified, the complexity of the individual studies were not fully captured. Second, the limited number of reports identified prevents a comprehensive assessment of the benefits and limitations of applying system dynamics to environmental health issues.",
    "More applications of system dynamics in this context is called for. Third, the multi-disciplinary nature of environmen- tal health may have caused us to miss some relevant re- ports. For example, work occurring in sectors such as environmental management, waste management and urban planning - although often not so intended - will directly or indirectly influence human health. It is pos- sible that some authors may not have labelled their work as being related to 'environmental health', making it diffi- cult to capture it in reviews such as this one.",
    "Similarly, system dynamics authors describing applications of modelling may have used different terminology to de- scribe their modelling approach, which would have caused their work to be missed by this scoping review. Finally, this review relied on reports being in the public domain. While a systematic search of the scientific and grey literature is likely to capture most reports originat- ing from academia, it is likely that there are reports based on system dynamics applications that have not been published.",
    "Conclusion In a world of rapidly changing environments, environ- mental health decisions and policies must be made re- gardless of the complexity of environmental health problems and significant uncertainties about the future. It is crucial that we move past discussing the general merits of a systems approach to addressing environmen- tal health problems, to determining how best to apply systems tools and methods to existing environmental health problems. Our review suggests that system dynamics is being ap- plied sparingly, but increasingly within the field of envir- onmental health. The method has significant potential when it comes to assisting decision-makers understand and analyse complex environmental health issues, as well predict the outcomes environmental health deci- sions and policies. System dynamics is currently being used in multiple different sectors to provide direct and indirect decision-support for population health policy and decision-making processes. Despite this, the contri- bution of system dynamics to environmental health pol-icy limited.",
    "Current decision-making and governance structures in many public organisations are not designed to integrate the multi-sectoral policy advice that system dynamics can provide. Therefore, the full potential of system dynamics to change the way in which environmental health problems are managed cannot be realised unless the decision-making and governance structures of public organisations are collaborative and coordinated.",

    "Our research on human nutrition and global health spans multiple countries, encompasses both interventional and observational study designs, and requires secure data collection and management. Noting the benefits of electronic data capture (EDC) over paper-based data capture [1,2], beginning in 2012, we searched for an EDC tool for our research projects on human health and were unable to find a package that met our needs. With several research projects on our roadmap that would be deployed in remote, international regions with complex longitudinal protocols, strict eligibility requirements, and distributed research teams, we aimed to use EDC over paper-based data capture to enforce our study protocols and provide better data security, data validation, and have instant access to data.",
    "In surveying EDC packages currently available on the market (Table 1), some had to be ruled out completely because of the unreliable internet coverage in areas we focused on for our studies (compared with Research Electronic Data Capture [REDCap], which had not yet released its mobile app when our initial research projects were being conducted in 2013 [3]).",
    "Other packages identified did not provide the required features specific to our study protocols, such as our strict data security specifications (compared with Open Data Kit [ODK]) [4].",
    "To address this, we felt that we had the correct clinical and technical team in place to build our own EDC tools to solve our needs and potentially those of a large community of researchers in the future. Objectives As we developed our plans for creating the EDC tools for our research studies, we decided that instead of a custom tool for each study, a better investment would be one reusable platform that could be applied to each research project, with limited customizations for each iteration. The upfront investment would be higher, but subsequent deployments should build on the initial investment.",
    "Mobile phones and tablet devices are commonly used, even in lower-resource settings where our studies are located. We felt that an EDC tool for tablets would be easier for our local research staff to learn, more transportable, and less expensive to deploy than laptops.

    "Configuration of ConnEDCt Study designers conduct a design process using Microsoft Excel templates to define the study schema. A forms schedule template is used to define case report form (CRF) usage over scheduled visits in a longitudinal study. The intersection of CRFs and scheduled visits in a two-dimensional matrix in this template shows which CRFs are instantiated per visit.",
    "In addition, CRFs can be defined for unscheduled instantiation. Study designers use data dictionary Excel templates to define variables within CRFs along with select lists, skip logic, etc. The study designers https://www.jmir.org/2020/8/e18580 XSL*FO RenderX then document the eligibility criteria formulas within another Excel template.",

Asynchronous Data Synchronization A key feature of ConnEDCt is the ability to capture data on a mobile device while offline and, at a later time, when an internet connection is available, send the captured data to a cloud-based server. In addition, study schema revisions can be deployed on mobile devices. The asynchronous data transport can be finely controlled such that data can be selectively deployed to individual mobile devices. In this manner, data can be synchronized in 1 direction only to minimize data traffic and to maintain data privacy.",

    "For example, when study protocols require audiovisual evidence of consent, ConnEDCt can use a mobile device's built-in camera and microphone to capture the consent process. Enforcement of Complex Study Protocols We designed ConnEDCt to support complex, longitudinal study protocols and minimize training requirements for field research https://www.jmir.org/2020/8/e18580 XSL*FO RenderX J Med Internet Res 2020 | vol. 22 | iss. 8 | e18580 | p. 6 (page number not for citation purposes) JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH Ruth et al staff.",
    "ConnEDCt provides features to support predefined longitudinal study schema, automated assignment of randomized study arms and midline serial sampling, and automated scheduling of additional CRFs based on captured responses. When ConnEDCt is configured for a study, visit records (eg, screening, baseline, midline, and endline) will be created as dictated by the study schema.",
    "CRFs are organized within appropriate visits. A visit is complete when all CRFs within the visit have been completed and signed. The interface clearly shows the schedule of visits (Figure 2) and the required CRFs for a particular visit (Figure 3).",
    "When the study includes an RCT, ConnEDCt can reference a randomization table to automatically assign a randomized arm to an eligible participant. When the study protocol includes midline serial sampling, ConnEDCt uses the internal randomization table to selectively include designated CRFs at the randomly designated midline visit (Figure 4). When responses to study questions determine the need for additional CRFs, they will be created on demand and presented in the visit schedule--for example, a response to a question on the number of pregnancies may trigger the same number of pregnancy CRFs, or a response on a sick form may trigger a blood or saliva sample CRF.",
    "These features reduce the learning curve for the research team. We believe that this improves the interview experience by allowing research assistants to focus on the study participant instead of on data management and study protocol compliance.",
    "Designed for Flexibility and Reuse The ConnEDCt architecture has a flexible schema and is designed to be adaptable to varying study protocols. Therefore, ConnEDCt is designed for flexibility and reuse.",
    "Events, event types, event forms, form schedules, form types, and eligibility criteria are defined in the data model and can be modified in the user interface. Validation rules and postprocessing triggers are built in a framework, minimizing the amount of custom code.",
    "In this manner, subsequent research studies can be implemented with minimal modification to the conceptual schema or programmatic code. When a new study protocol is implemented, entities for visits and CRFs are created, whereas the programming that controls participant management, navigation, eligibility, and study protocols responds to changes in study protocol design.",
    "Language Customization and Data Location The ConnEDCt system can also accommodate CRFs in multiple languages, as shown in Figure 5.",
    "Professionally translated questionnaires can be entered into FileMaker using native multilingual keyboards. Furthermore, data can be synchronized to and primarily stored on in-country servers, where available, to comply with local laws in many settings.",

This preintervention biomarker survey is being conducted among 1500 women of reproductive age (15-40 years) who are not pregnant or lactating along with their households ID: NCT04048330; as reported in Finkelstein JL, Fothergill A, Johnson CB, et al., 2020).",
    "ConnEDCt allows enumerators to select from an imported list of households and to individually screen all women from each household while integrating all household-level data into each woman's final record. Synchronization is performed daily after data collection on all iPads.",
    "This allows for the maintenance of all household characteristics for women in the study while preventing enumerators from needing to re-enter data for all women within a household. (ClinicalTrials.gov in Southern India RCTs: Intervention Studies The ConnEDCt platform for surveillance described above will be incorporated for an upcoming randomized efficacy trial, A Randomized Trial of Quadruple Fortified Salt for Anemia and Birth Defects Prevention in Southern India (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03853304; quadruple fortified salt [QFS]). This trial will be conducted among 1000 women of reproductive age who are not pregnant or lactating with their households using similar algorithms for eligibility and CRFs for data collection as the surveillance study. ConnEDCt was also used for an RCT in Mumbai, Effect of Iron/Zinc-biofortified Pearl Millet on Growth and Immunity in Children Aged 12-18 Months in India (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02233764) that completed data collection in July 2018",
    "[12]. The full protocol of the study was integrated into ConnEDCt, which included the eligibility evaluation of over 400 participants; randomization to one of 2 experimental arms, accounting for a random midline serial sample; and a diverse set of CRFs to collect data from participants at 9 monthly follow-up visits. After a training session, local research assistants independently scheduled visits and collected data throughout the trial, including synchronization to the secure server.",
    "Importantly, ConnEDCt was also able to be modified after pilot testing among research assistants and participants in the field to improve the workflow, such as improving the placement of certain buttons or options on each form screen. Real-time feedback of data throughout the trial allowed for error checking concurrently with data collection.",
    "Specifically, data were exported from ConnEDCt as a relational database in the form of an Excel spreadsheet (1 per each type of CRF) using a custom script. These data were then imported and merged into 1 full database in statistical software packages and subsequently analyzed for errors, such as biologically implausible values or https://www.jmir.org/2020/8/e18580 XSL*FO RenderX typographical errors during data entry.",
    "One asset of the ability to analyze the data in SAS concurrently with the trial permitted examination of the raw variables for a particular eligibility criterion necessitating advanced statistical analysis, after which results could be re-entered into ConnEDCt. The ability to access the full database concurrently as the trial was ongoing was also crucial to summarizing data, such as technical reports to the study funders and progress reports, as well as any adverse events for our data safety and monitoring board. The EDC framework established for the Mumbai trial was customized and expanded for a second ongoing RCT evaluating multiple biofortified food crops (MBFC) in children and their mothers, Effect of a Biofortified Food Basket on Micronutrient Status and Immune and Cognitive Function among Infants in India in Madanapalle, South India (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02648893) to incorporate a different type of participant (mother-child dyads) and CRFs specific to the trial.",
    "The protocol was modified to include (1) a 2-level randomization to 1 of 4 color-coded groups, with 2 groups corresponding to each treatment arm and randomization to a midline sampling point; (2) visit scheduling and tracking over a 9-month follow-up period; and (3) data collection across integrated CRFs to handle screening and eligibility determination, sample collection, and participant tracking. A randomization protocol was created that was executed by the study statistician and shared with the ConnEDCt programmer to incorporate into the database. Similar to Mumbai, the MBFC trial is synchronizing daily after data collection during follow-up appointments. screening, baseline, and Errors During Implementation During implementation of data capture, the more common errors included inputting the wrong CRF for a participant at the wrong visit or miscoding variables (eg, a numeric coding for a character variable).",
    "These were easily resolved by the database developer and/or data manager. Discussion Principal Findings The benefits of using ConnEDCt as an EDC system greatly outweigh the few challenges.",
    "Below, we describe how we addressed potential or actual issues of connectivity, complexity in consent forms, participant confidentiality, and research staff compliance. Problem 1: Connectivity",
    "In all settings, data were synchronized to the server and the participant's data were harmonized by the MirrorSync software [5]. To account for lapses in internet connectivity and prevent data conflicts, synchronization was performed at the end of each day of data collection in the RCTs to avoid data conflicts and any need for internet connectivity throughout the data collection process.",
    "In practice, 1 iPad was assigned to a particular participant for the duration of the visit and, after completion of the visit, all iPads were synced to the data server. In contrast to RCTs, the clinic-based cross-sectional study in Ecuador (FeverPhone) required multiple users to input data for J Med Internet Res 2020 | vol.",
    "22 | iss. 8 | e18580 | p. 13 (page number not for citation purposes) JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH Ruth et al a single participant using separate devices in different clinical locations. Therefore, regular synchronization was important for study procedures. The clinical site did not offer wireless internet access, but each iPad was fitted with a prepaid mobile SIM card to allow for regular synchronization during participant visits.",
    "For the periconceptional surveillance program, the database was designed such that iPads could remain at 1 station for data collection while participants moved from station to station. This greatly simplified data collection and allowed each enumerator to continue using the same iPad to help track enumerator productivity and workflow.",
    "Problem 2: Complex Consent Forms In Mumbai's RCT, informed consent was taken at 3 separate visits: prescreening (consent to noninvasive data collection), screening (consent to biospecimen collection and growth measurements), and enrollment (consent to participate in the trial), including informed consent signatures per the type of data collected. During follow-up, we included informed consent signatures on biological specimen collection forms to remind participants of their option to opt out of the trial at any time.",
    "One RCT in Southern India, the MBFC trial, combined the informed consent process into a single form, with multiple levels of consent. Participants were asked separately for their consent to screening and participation in the trial, subsequent biological sample storage and analysis, and future analyses of their biological samples, which may include genetic analysis.",
    "This allowed documentation and tracking of different levels of consent for each participant as well as allowing for tracking of which participants consented to future analyses. At the Ecuador clinical site, study procedures required separate consent or assent forms depending on the participant's age.",
    "ConnEDCt automatically provided the appropriate consent or assent forms based on the date of birth information provided in the recruitment CRF. ConnEDCt would further limit progress to subsequent CRFs if the appropriate consent or assent forms were incomplete.",
    "The periconceptional surveillance study in Southern India has a complex informed consent process because of multiple factors influencing eligibility and additional factors to determine which set of informed consent forms need to be completed. In the periconceptional surveillance program, participants included adolescents aged 15 to 18 years (requiring an assent form and parental consent) and adults (>=18 years of age, requiring a consent form) are potentially eligible to participate.",
    "To ensure that participants complete the correct forms and that all required signatures are obtained, the participant's age (to the day) is required in real time. ConnEDCt was able to be adapted for this purpose to determine a participant's eligibility, and which set of forms they needed to complete to enroll. Additionally, to account for variable amounts of information being available for the determination of current age, we developed an algorithm that considered all available information (current age, exact date of birth, and estimated/partial date of birth).",
    "The database developer built the algorithm into ConnEDCt such that research assistants entered data available to them, and the software made visible the CRFs that they needed to proceed (eg, CRFs https://www.jmir.org/2020/8/e18580 XSL*FO RenderX indicating the participant was eligible and which set of assent/consent forms they needed to sign). To simplify and streamline the process, we adapted ConnEDCt such that it only allowed necessary CRFs to appear on the iPad for the research assistants, making it impossible for research assistants to fill out the incorrect set of CRFs.",
    "Problem 3: Confidentiality Confidentiality was maintained in RCTs, clinic-based cross-sectional studies, and repeated cross-sectional studies, such as our surveillance program, through many layers of security. First, each their own computer-generated unique username and password to access the database. Second, although participant names were included in the database to facilitate tracking of each participant locally, names were easily removed for deidentification after exporting the data. Participants were identified with ID numbers derived from a 4-digit sequentially generated code and a letter corresponding to the participant's color group study allocation.",
    "field personnel had The periconceptional surveillance program includes women of reproductive age and their families--and a hierarchical data structure. In the database, each participant has an identifying individual participant ID and a household ID, which in combination, uniquely identifies them as a participant in the periconceptional surveillance program; the latter being generated by ConnEDCt. Their personal ID incorporates a code that indicates that they are a participant in the surveillance program, a code indicating which iPad their data were collected on, and an additional 4-digit code (generated sequentially by ConnEDCt) to ensure that all participants have unique IDs. This identification system in ConnEDCt allows for an undetermined number of participants to be enrolled in the surveillance program while ensuring that no duplicate IDs are utilized.",
    "The structure of the IDs (3 concatenated codes) also provides flexibility to add and remove pieces to indicate the person's participation in potential future studies led by the Finkelstein research group in this area (eg, for the upcoming QFS randomized efficacy trial). Problem 4: Compliance The data collected in the periconceptional surveillance program are very detailed and complex.",
    "To improve data quality during collection, we built various safeguards into the data collection tools. For free-entry numeric variables, limits were placed around values entered that would flag responses and indicate enumerators that data entered seemed implausible.",
    "For example, if a participant's weight was entered as 1 kg, a flag would pop up on the iPad screen, indicating that the response was outside the anticipated range and ask the enumerator to verify the entry before moving forward. In addition to raw variable entry, these flags were also built in to read across multiple variables that were deemed to be of high importance. If a participant's response was left blank, or if a response to question 1 directly contradicted with an entry for question 3, a flag would pop up and ask the enumerator to verify before continuing.",
    "Finally, various time stamps were built into variables throughout the questionnaire to allow for remote monitoring of enumerator progress. Enumerators had to log in using their unique username and password before any data entry and had to sign each form J Med Internet Res 2020 | vol.",
    "22 | iss. 8 | e18580 | p. 14 (page number not for citation purposes) JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH Ruth et al they entered data on using their unique username and password before they could continue.",
    "The RCTs incorporated similar compliance measures into the ConnEDCt EDC system, including real-time calculations for replicate measurements, thresholds for variation to prompt additional replicates, and flagging of responses outside of expected ranges. Adaptive and forced protocols are also implemented into CRFs.",
    "For example, anthropometric measurements for the first replicate need to be entered before the next replicate fields will be displayed, meaning a full replicate of the measurement protocol is followed instead of basic remeasurements with participants and equipment in the same position. Adaptive protocols and instructions are also included.",
    "For example, for certain anthropometric measurements such as triceps skinfold, the research assistant determines the participant's dominant arm, triggering ConnEDCt to prompt the research assistant to use the participant's other, nondominant arm. Furthermore, warning pop-ups (logic checks) for impossible or nonbiologically plausible data (such as body weight entered or calculated as a negative number) were incorporated into ConnEDCt, allowing real-time data correction during data collection, minimizing challenges in ascertaining errors during data cleaning and analysis.",
    "Queries, raised by research assistants and/or data managers concurrently with the study or after data collection is completed, can be settled by data managers who have form modification privileges. ConnEDCt includes an audit trail to monitor when data were modified and by whom.",
    "Conclusions ConnEDCt, an EDC system, is an ideal tool for research studies, particularly those with complex protocols in settings where internet access is limited. In addition to mitigating the time required and error-prone nature of paper-based data collection methods, ConnEDCt represents a fixed framework that is adaptable to a variety of study designs. As demonstrated in a variety of settings, the ConnEDCt EDC system has been integral to carrying out several studies, all diverse in design and setting, types of participants, and overall goals for the research. Compared with other EDC tools [1,2,13-24], ConnEDCt's benefits, including its utility as a mobile system, the ability to collect data without internet access, customization options for specific study designs, and data security, are comparable with systems such as REDCap and other systems",
    "[3,25,26], while at the same time serving complex protocols more precisely than other systems. An EDC system can be made as a straightforward framework that is adaptable for the successful management and completion of almost all kinds of field-based research studies and allows for easy export and transfer of collected data into statistical processing software for further analyses.",

Analytical methods were developed for the determination of antibiotics in milk, with key priority given to the analyte extraction and preconcentration step. Extraction can benefit from the production of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) that can be applied as sorbents for the extraction of specific antibiotics.",

    "Introduction Milk-producing animals are typically kept overcrowded under unsanitary conditions suffering from various infections and for this reason they are administered antibiotics through their feed or water. Dairy cows are treated with antibiotics in therapeutic doses in order to treat diseases such as mastitis, bacteremia, diarrhea and pulmonary diseases or for prophylactic reasons.",
    "They are also administered at sub-therapeutic doses for growth promoting purposes. However, the excessive use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine has resulted in the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Furthermore, antibiotic residues are found in milk and dairy products, posing a threat for human health, since they can cause allergic reactions and other toxic effects to sensitive groups.",
    "For this reason, the European Union has published the \"Commission Regulation (EU) No. 37/2010 of 22 December 2009 on pharmacologically active substances and their classification regarding maximum residue limits in foodstuffs of animal origin\" and every animal originated product should comply with [1-3].

    "Molecular Imprinting Molecular imprinting is based on the polymerization of a functional monomer and a cross-linker around a template molecule.

Usually, the templates are small organic molecules, such as pesticides, pharmaceuticals, sugars, amino acids and peptides [39,40].",
    "Functional monomers consist of a recognition unit that interacts with the template and a polymerizable unit that is polymerized with the cross-linker. The recognition site of the selected functional monomer should develop strong interactions with the functional groups of the template molecule to form a complex before polymerization takes place.",
    "Functional monomers such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid (MAA), methyl methacrylate, 2-(trifluoromethyl)acrylic acid (TFMAA), styrene, 4-vinylpyridine (4-VP), acrylamide (AM), methacrylamide, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) are used in non-covalent imprinting [36,39,40]. The cross-linker polymerizes with the polymerizable unit of the functional monomer to form a highly cross-linked polymer around the template-monomer complex that remains firm after the template removal. The selectivity and the binding capacity of the developed MIP depend Insufficient amount of the cross-linker results in on the amount of the selected cross-linker.",
    "mechanically unstable poorly cross-linked MIPs, one the other hand increased amount results in MIPs with reduced imprinted sites. Cross-linkers such as ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA), trimethylopropane methacrylate (TRIM), divinylbenzene (DVB) and tetramethylene dimethacrylate are used in non-covalent imprinting [36,39,40]. The selection of the porogenic solvent is also important in molecular imprinting.",
    "The porogen influences the interaction between the template and the monomer, serves as the dispersion media and affects the pore forming during the polymerization reaction. In non-covalent imprinting less polar or non-polar solvents such as toluene, acetonitrile and chloroform are preferred [39,40]. Most MIPs are prepared by free radical polymerization that is initiated either thermally or photochemically with the addition of a peroxy or an azo compound. The most frequently used azo compound is azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) that is used at temperature range of 50-70 *C [39].",
    "After the polymerization reaction is complete, template removal is essential before the prepared MIPs can be used in any application. Template removal should be meticulously performed in order to ensure that the maximum number of imprinted sites are free of the template molecule, especially in analytical applications where template bleeding can affect the results. Complete removal of the template often requires extreme conditions that can impair the imprinted sites. Template removal can be performed by three main approaches, solvent extraction, physically assisted extraction or the use of subcritical/supercritical solvents (subcritical water/supercritical CO2).",
    "Physically assisted extraction includes ultrasound-assisted, microwave-assisted and pressurized liquid extraction. The most common approach is the use of organic solvents, either by incubating the prepared MIPs in organic solvents or by extraction in a Soxhlet apparatus.",
    "MIP incubation is a mild template removal method that requires several hours to be complete but does not impair the imprinted sites. Incubation in organic solvents causes swelling of the MIP structure and favors template removal, while heating and stirring can reduce the duration of template removal.",
    "Extraction in a Soxhlet apparatus is a more drastic method where the template is extracted for several hours with heated organic solvent and is more commonly used for MIPs prepared by bulk polymerization. The heated solvent increases template solubility, thus template removal. However, Soxhlet extraction is a time-consuming method (up to 24 h) that requires increased volumes of organic solvent and high temperatures can cause template degradation",
    "[41]. There are two main approaches for the preparation of MIPs based on the interactions between the template molecule and the functional monomer that can be either covalent or non-covalent. In the covalent approach, reversible covalent interactions are developed between the functional groups of the template and the recognition unit of the monomer. Covalent imprinting is stoichiometric and Molecules 2018, 23, 316 4 of 33 functional monomer residues can only be found in the imprinted sites.",
    "Template removal is usually achieved by treating the prepared MIPs with organic solvents or Soxhlet extraction, while molecule binding is based on covalent interactions. However, there are limited reversible covalent interactions available and the strong nature of covalent interactions does not favor fast binding and removal on the imprinted sites [38,40,42]. In the non-covalent approach, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces and ionic or p-p interactions are developed for the formation of the template-monomer complex in a pre-polymerization step, with hydrogen bonding being the most common interaction.",
    "Template removal is achieved by washing the prepared MIPs with an organic solvent or a mixture of solvents, while molecule binding is based on non-covalent interactions. Non-covalent imprinting is a simple MIP preparation process that offers fast binding and removal on the imprinted sites and is the most preferred approach.",
    "However, the interactions forming the template-monomer are not as stable and prone to disruption [38,40,42].",
    "Classic molecular imprinting involves a single template for the preparation of a MIP with imprinted sites that are not able to recognize more than one target molecule. With multi-template imprinting more templates are used for the preparation of MIPs with more than one type of imprinted sites able for simultaneous recognition of multiple target molecules. The multi-template MIPs enable the extraction and determination of multiple analytes; however, they have reduced selectivity compared with one-template MIPs [39].",
    "Like multi-template imprinting, MIPs can be prepared by employing more than one functional monomer. Each functional monomer is able to recognize a different functional group of the template molecule and the resulting in MIPs presents increased selectivity.",
    "Multi-functional monomer imprinting can be helpful for the imprinting of macromolecules. However, thorough study is required for the selection of the appropriate monomers and their combining synergy in preparing MIPs with multiple functional monomers [39].",
    "Sometimes in molecular imprinting the desirable template molecule can be chemically unstable or has low solubility during polymerization, difficult to handle, or even an expensive compound, thus dummy imprinting employs a surrogate structurally analogue molecule as an alternative template for MIP preparation. Furthermore, the drawback of template bleeding when MIPs are used for SPE applications can be removed by the employment of dummy imprinted MIPs [36,38,39].",
    "MIP Characterization Morphological evaluation of the prepared MIPs can be accomplished by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), while structure analysis by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extended X-ray absorption fine structures (EXAFS) and X-ray diffraction studies. Template molecule-functional monomer complex interactions can be screened by infrared (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and UV-Vis spectroscopy.",
    "In the case of MMIPs, the magnetic properties of MMIPs can be analyzed by vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) [36,39].",
    "In addition to the MIP, a non-imprinted polymer (NIP) is usually prepared without the presence of the template molecule. Although NIP has no imprinted sites, NIP preparation is carried out under the same conditions as the MIP and interactions between the NIP and the target molecule can be observed. This acts as control to characterize the quality of imprinted sites on the MIP surface and measure how strong are the interactions between the MIP and the target molecule in comparison with those between the NIP and the template.",
    "Binding tests are conducted by applying both the prepared MIP and NIP in solutions of predetermined concentration of the target molecule and measuring the retained amount. Binding tests can be conducted in solutions consisting of the same solvent used in MIP preparation or a solvent that simulates the nature of the analyzed sample.",
    "By doing these tests, the best type of functional monomer or template/monomer ratio can be chosen to optimize MIP preparation, while the best solvent for analyte extraction or analyte elution can be selected to optimize the sample preparation protocol [36]. Molecules 2018, 23, 316 5 of 33 3. Polymerization Techniques for MIP Preparation There are two main approaches applied for the preparation of MIPs, free radical polymerization, controlled radical polymerization and sol-gel process. 3.1.",
    "Free Radical Polymerization (FRP) Bulk polymerization is a fast and simple polymerization method that provides pure MIPs with no special instrumentation requirements. It is the most widely used free radical polymerization method for preparing MIPs applied in sample extraction techniques.",
    "However, this method requires increased template amount and the prepared MIP bulk should be grinded, sieved and sedimented with the use of a solvent in order to remove the finer particles and obtain particles of the preferred size. This is time consuming and the resulting particles have irregular shape and size, decreased number of imprinted sites and binding capacity, while template bleeding can be observed [36-39].",
    "Suspension polymerization is a simple, single-step polymerization method where polymerization mixture is suspended in a continuous aqueous, mineral oil or perfluorocarbon liquid phase and provides spherical porous MIP particles. However, the developed MIP particles size ranges between um-mm with decreased recognition capability, unsuitable for solid-phase extraction applications [38,39].",
    "Emulsion polymerization takes place in an oil/water diphasic system with the addition of surfactants that prevents diffusion and favors the formation of small, homogeneous emulsion droplets. Emulsion polymerization can provide mono-dispersed MIP particles, in high yield, however surfactant residues can interfere with the imprinted sites, thus reduce binding capacity of the MIPs",
    "[37-39]. Precipitation polymerization is a single-step polymerization method that provides high-quality, spherical MIP particles with homogenous size in good yield. As the polymerization takes place spherical MIP particles precipitate from the reaction solution. However, this method requires increased amount of organic solvent and meticulous control over the polymerization conditions such as solvent polarity, temperature and stirring speed that affect the MIP particle size",
    "[36-38,40]. MIP monoliths can be prepared inside a confined space such as a chromatographic column by in-situ polymerization.",

Controlled Radical Polymerization (CRP) Polymerization usually involves reaction initiation, polymer chain propagation and reaction In free radical polymerization, reaction initiation is slow while chain propagation termination. is fast.",
    "Additionally, side reactions such as chain transfer reactions between the components of the polymerization mixture or reactions with impurities can occur. As a result, polymerization is prematurely terminated and polymer chains with variable lengths are formed. For this reason, MIP size, structure and molecular weight cannot be controlled, while heterogenous cross-linked network and imprinted site distribution can be observed.",
    "Controlled radical polymerization offers control over the polymerization reaction with the use of capping agents that prevent premature termination. Reaction initiation is fast, while chain propagation is slow and simultaneous for all polymer chains. The resulting polymer chains have homogenously distributed size and molecular weight. The most common controlled radical polymerization approaches are atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP) and reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization.",
    "ATRP involves a reversible redox reaction catalyzed by a metal-ligand complex and the resulting MIPs have functional groups that enable surface modification. However, ATRP uses in MIP synthesis are limited because the functional groups of the template molecule and the recognition unit of the functional monomer can inhibit the metal-ligand complex.",
    "NMP involves a thermally reversible termination reaction that produces a nitroxyl radical that allows control over the polymerization reaction. Although NMP can be used in the presence of various functional groups, it requires temperatures over 100 *C that can affect the non-covalent interactions between the template molecule and the functional monomer, thus it is limited to covalent imprinting approaches. RAFT polymerization involves reversible addition-fragmentation sequences initiated by a FRP initiator and chain propagation is achieved with the help of a chain transfer agent.",
    "It can be used with a variety of functional groups and is suitable for non-covalent imprinting purposes [43,44]. Surface Imprinting In surface imprinting, the template molecule is immobilized on the surface of a suitable material, where polymerization takes place, in order to prepare MIPs with controllable imprinted sites. The template can be completely removed and the resulting imprinted sites have improved accessibility that is important for imprinting macromolecules such as proteins.",
    "However, the number of the imprinted sites is proportionate to the surface area of the substrate material [37-39].",
    "Core-shell MIPs can be prepared by surface imprinting on nanomaterials such as chitosan, polystyrene, SiO2, TiO2, and Fe3O4 combining the properties of both MIPs and nanomaterials. For the preparation of magnetic MIPs (MMIPs), appropriately prepared Fe3O4 nanoparticles undergo functionalization or surface modification and then molecular imprinting takes place on the surface of the magnetite nanoparticles, either with a free radical polymerization method or the sol-gel process.",
    "MMIPs can be collected from a solution with the application of an external magnet, thus they can be used in sample preparation providing an easier, less time-consuming and efficient analyte extraction procedure [37,38,45,46]. 3.3.",
    "Sol-Gel Synthesis Highly cross-linked materials can be prepared by the sol-gel synthesis that involves the hydrolysis of a tetraalkylosilane such as tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) into a colloidal solution and the polycondensation of the solution into a silica-based material. Compared with free radical polymerization, sol-gel process can take place in room temperature, is resistant to chemical and thermal decomposition and requires non-toxic solvents such as methanol and ultrapure water Fabric [36,47].",
    "Although the sol-gel process is convenient and results in porous MIPs, the binding-rebinding process on the imprinted sites is slow and hard to be achieved [17]. Furthermore, there are limited polymerization reactions and precursors utilized in sol-gel synthesis of MIPs [39].",
    "Molecules 2018, 23, 316 7 of 33 4. MIPs in Sample Preparation The ability of the imprinted sites to recognize and bind with a specific molecule, makes MIPs excellent sorbent materials for sample preparation techniques such as solid-phase extraction (SPE), dispersive solid-phase extraction (DSPE), matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD) and solid-phase microextraction (SPME).",
    "4.1. Molecularly Imprinted Solid-Phase Extraction (MISPE)",
    "Following the classic SPE approach, MIP particles are packed inside an empty cartridge. The MIP SPE cartridges are preconditioned and loaded with a sample.",
    "Before analyte elution the MIPs are washed with a solvent or a mixture of solvents such as methanol, acetonitrile or water that will remove all interferences and not the bound analyte. Elution is carried out by a solvent that is able to release the bound analyte from the imprinted sites.",
    "MIPs prepared by bulk polymerization are very common in SPE applications. Furthermore, MIP packed pre-columns or monolithic columns can be used in on-line with an analytical instrument [37,38,40]. 4.2.",
    "Dispersive Solid-Phase Extraction (DSPE) In DSPE, MIP particles can be dispersed directly into the sample solution and after the extraction is complete they can be collected by centrifuging or filtration. This technique requires reduced MIPs amount in comparison with SPE and offers improved contact of the sorbent with the sample components, while eliminating the tedious packing the MIPs inside an SPE cartridge and the preconditioning step [38,39].",
    "4.3. Matrix Solid-Phase Dispersion (MSPD) Most sample preparation techniques are usually applied in sample solutions that result from a sample pre-treatment step, thus they cannot be applied directly to solid, semi-solid or samples with increased viscosity. With MSPD the MIP particles are added directly to the sample, mechanically mixed and the resulting mixture is packed inside a cartridge, washed and the analytes are eluted with the appropriate solvent.",
    "This technique has decreased organic solvent requirements and reduces matrix interferences [39]. 4.4. Solid-Phase Microextraction (SPME)",

    "The coated fibber can be applied directly to the sample solution and after extraction it is injected directly to the analytical instrument and the analyte is desorpted either by an appropriate organic solvent in the case of an HPLC application or thermally in the case of a GC application. Apart from MIP-coated fibers, MIP monolith fibers can be prepared and used in an SPME protocol. Polymerization is performed inside a sealed capillary and after completion a part of the capillary is removed so that the MIP monolith is exposed [37,38,40,42,46].",

CAP is the oldest amphenicol antibiotic and was originally Molecules 2018, 23, 316 8 of 33 isolated in 1947 from Streptomyces venezuelae cultures. It inhibits bacterial proteins synthesis; thus, it is effective against many bacteria strains and used for clinical purposes.",
    "CAP, TAP and FFC are used for veterinary purposes, for bacterial infection prevention and treatment. However, high toxicity and unwanted effects can be observed and their use in food-producing animals is illegal in most countries.

The MIP nanoparticles were washed methanol and dried under vacuum at 60 *C. SMO-MIP nanoparticles (100 mg) were added to pretreated spiked milk extract (50 mL) and the mixture was incubated for 45 min at room temperature and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded and the nanoparticles were collected. The analytes were eluted with methanol-acetic acid (9:1, v/v), the elute was evaporated under nitrogen stream and the dry residue was reconstituted with methanol (1 mL).",
    "In comparison with the respective NIP, MIP adsorption capacity for SMO was higher, with Qmax values of 5634 and 20,210 and ug/g, while binding specificity study between SMO, SDZ, SMZ, sulfadimethoxine, sulfamerazine and sulfameter showed MIP selectivity over SMO and the imprinting factor was 21.52 for SMO. The SiO2-SMO-MIP nanoparticles were compared with SMO-MIPs prepared by bulk polymerization in terms of SMO binding capacity and demonstrated three times higher capacity. Furthermore, Molecules 2018, 23, 316 25 of 33 SMO adsorption equilibrium was achieved in 45 min with the SiO2-SMO-MIP nanoparticles and 10 h with the SMO-MIPs, proving that the developed MIP nanoparticles had higher number of imprinted sites and improved accessibility by the analytes [85].",
    "A MSPE-HPLC-UV method was developed for the determination of SMO in milk and honey samples. SMO (150 mg) and MAA (225 uL) were dissolved in acetonitrile (30 mL) and the mixture was stored for 12 h in a refrigerator.",
    "A second mixture was prepared by dissolving vinyl-modified magnetic carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (100 mg) in acetonitrile (30 mL), EGDMA (1 mL) and AIBN (40 mg) were added, and the mixture was sonicated 30 min and degassed under nitrogen stream for 10 min. The two mixtures were combined and stirred and left to pre-polymerize at 50 *C for 6 h, polymerize at 60 *C for 24 h and left to age at 75 *C for 6 h under nitrogen stream and continuous stirring.",
    "The template was removed by incubating the developed MIPs in methanol-acetic acid (9:1, v/v) and the MIP particles were washed with methanol and dried under vacuum. Magnetic CNTs-SMO-MIPs (100 mg) were added into pretreated spiked milk extract (20 mL) and the mixture was kept for 1 h. The MMIPs were collected by means of a magnet and the supernatant was discarded.",
    "The analytes were eluted with methanol-acetic acid (9:1, v/v), the eluate was reduced and the residue was reconstituted with acetonitrile (1 mL). In comparison with the respective NIP, MIP adsorption capacity for SMO was higher, with Qmax values of 864.9 ug/g, while binding specificity study between SMO, SMZ, sulfadimethoxine, sulfamerazine and sulfameter showed MIP selectivity over SMO and the imprinting factors were 10 for SMO, 1.7 for SMZ, 1.9 for sulfadimethoxine, 2.3 for sulfamerazine and 1.5 for sulfameter [86]. A PMME-HPLC-PAD method was developed for the determination of SMO. SMO (0.05 mmol) dissolved in acetonitrile (400 uL) was mixed with AM (0.1 mmol) and 4-VP (0.1 mmol) and mixture was sonicated for 4 h. EGDMA (1 mmol) and AIBN (9.7 mg) were added and was degassed under nitrogen stream for 10 min.",
    "The mixture (50 uL) was transferred and sealed inside a micropipette tip and polymerization was carried out at 60 *C for 24 h. The template was removed by incubation in methanol.",
    "The developed MIP monolith containing micropipette tip was connected to a syringe that was employed for the sample loading, washing and elution steps. The SMO-MIP monolith was preconditioned with acetonitrile (2 mL) and water (1 mL), loaded with pretreated milk extract (5 mL) and washed with water (0.5 mL).",
    "The analytes were eluted with acetonitrile (0.1 mL) and the eluate was injected directly for analysis. The developed magnetic SMO-MIPs could be reused for five extraction cycles [87].",
    "A SBSE-HPLC-UV method was developed for the determination of trimethoprim, SMZ, sulfamerazine and sulfameter in urine, plasma and milk samples. Trimethoprim (290.4 g) and MAA (0.34 mL) were dissolved in acetonitrile (20 mL) and the mixture was stored for 12 h at room temperature. EGDMA (2.26 mL) and AIBN (90 mg) were added and the mixture was degassed under sonication for 5 min.",
    "A silylated glass capillary was introduced into the mixture (1.5 mL) inside a test tube and polymerization was carried out at 60 *C for 2 h. The procedure was repeated for seven times until a coating of 21.5 um thickness was acquired. A magnetic core was sealed inside the glass capillary which was then coated with a 2-cm thick coating.",
    "The template was removed by incubating the developed MIP coated stir bars in methanol-acetic acid (9:1, v/v). A trimethoprim-MIP coated stir bar was introduced in pretreated spiked milk extract (10 mL) and extraction was carried out under stirring at 500 rpm for 45 min. The stir bar was collected and analytes were eluted with acetonitrile-phosphoric acid (20:80, v/v) and sonication for 2 min. The extraction capacity of the MIP-coating was found 1.7 times higher than the NIP-coating [88].",

    "This review has successfully reported novel applications of MIPs as sorbent materials for the extraction and chromatographic determination of various antibiotic categories in milk samples. Overall, MIP-based techniques offer improved sample clean-up efficiency and increased selectivity over the target analytes. The reported methods achieved lower limits of detection and quantification (LOD and LOQ) or decision limits and detection capabilities (CCa and CCb) and equally good extraction recoveries compared with methods that employ sample preparation techniques with conventional sorbent materials (Table 6).",
    "Furthermore, in many cases MIPs could be reused for more than one extraction cycle in contrast with conventional materials that have only one use. However, MIPs are mainly applied in deproteinized and defatted milk extracts and not directly in milk samples, for the extraction and determination of structurally related analytes with the template molecule used for their synthesis.",
    "Additionally, template removal requires increased organic solvent amount and is a rather time-consuming procedure. There is no deny of the usefulness of the MIPs in sample preparation. MIPs future perspectives include improved MIP synthesis and efficient template removal, MIPs with multi-class and multi-analyte extraction capability, as well as direct sample application.",

    "And bACkgrOund Public and patient involvement in health and social research is regarded by funding bodies and policy makers as an integral part of good practice and democratisation of the research process.1 There is growing recognition that lay people have valuable expertise that should inform the research process, as well as having the right to be more actively involved in the design and outputs of research that is about and for them. Increasingly, research funding bodies also require researchers to demon- strate the value of patient and public involve- ment by evidencing its impact.2 in There is now a substantial body of evidence on good practice involving patients in research to improve the services that they need3-5 and a growing literature on involving the wider public in communi- ty-based prevention and health promotion research, for example, engaging residents of areas in which neighbourhood initiatives are based.6 7 There are few studies, however, BMJOpen:firstpublishedas./jbmopen--onApril.lDownoadedfromhttp://bmopen.bmjj.com/onJanuary,atiAcqusitionDepartmentiLbraryUnviof Anderson de Cuevas R, et al.

Argu- ably, one of the main reasons for this dearth of public involvement studies at the population level is the many additional challenges that public health research of this nature throws up.",
    "Not least among these challenges is the selection of the most appropriate representatives from among 'the general public' and the question of where in the process, and in what form, that involvement would be both effective and acceptable to those involved, given the highly technical nature of the statistical analysis of epide- miological datasets. In this paper, we aim to present the findings of our attempts to tackle some of these challenges, by incorpo- rating public and stakeholder involvement in the eval- uation of the impact on health inequalities of a natural policy experiment in labour market 'flexicurity'. We explain what we did and why, and how that involvement benefited the interpretation of our research findings and conceptualisation of future research.",
    "'Flexicurity' and the employment of people with a disability or chronic illness There is a general rise across Europe in the numbers of disabled and chronically ill people of working age that are not in employment. This is a matter of growing concern for governments due to its adverse consequences for public health and potential to exacerbate health inequalities, as well as its effect on increasing social secu- rity expenditure.8 Ageing populations and a raised retire- ment age in several countries mean that the proportion of the working age population leaving the labour force due to ill-health is expected to rise further.8 9 In Sweden, the proportion of the population receiving sickness or activity compensation has trebled in the last 30 years.10 The combined cost of sick leave and disability pensions equates to approximately 4% of Swedish gross domestic product (GDP) and nearly 8% of the working age population receive disability pensions.8",
    "The situa- tion in Denmark and Norway is similar (8% and 10%, respectively), while in the UK, more than 2.6 million people receive incapacity-related benefits, accounting for a quarter of the social security budget and 1.5% of GDP.11 Being outside the labour market is likely to add to the social and economic exclusion of people with a disability or illness, as income, opportunities to participate fully in society and quality of life decrease.8 9 People in poor health have lower employment prospects than the general population, and these prospects diminish in line with declining socioeconomic position.12 13 The social gradient in the employment of people with disabilities may serve to widen health inequalities, since the more disadvantaged who already have a higher prevalence of ill health will be further disadvantaged by the negative effects of unemployment.9 European countries have undertaken a range of labour market initiatives that may affect the ability of chronically ill and disabled people to get and keep a job.8 Popula- tion-wide policies centre around two axes: how flex- ible the labour market is (the degree of regulation and employment rights) and how much financial security the welfare system offers to disabled people who are out of work. These policies have generated considerable debate about their possible impact on the employment opportu- nities of chronically ill and disabled people in different socioeconomic groups. Increased flexibility of employment conditions is considered to have contributed to higher levels of job insecurity and to have disproportionately affected those who find themselves in the most vulnerable positions in the labour force (including women, the low skilled and people with disabilities).14 Since labour market deregu- lation is considered an essential strategy to redress the economic downturn, 'flexicurity' has been proposed as an alternative, compensating for increased flexibility with provisions of security.10 Flexicurity policies aim to integrate a flexible labour market with strong financial security and active labour market policies.",
    "(Denmark and the Netherlands are often cited as exemplars of flexicurity in its most developed form.) As part of the developing methodologies to reduce inequalities in the determinants of health (DEMETRIQ) project funded by an FP7 EU grant, we investigated the impact of flex- icurity policies on social inequalities in the chances of being in employment for people with and without limiting long-standing illness (LLI) in European coun- tries. To do this, we exploited, for research purposes, the contrasts in flexibility and financial security found in exemplar countries, which provided the necessary vari- ation for a natural policy experiment (see, eg, ref 15). The case study in public involvement reported here was conducted as a component of the Swedish country study.",
    "study design and methods The qualitative study aimed to explore how public and stakeholder involvement could be incorporated effec- tively into the evaluation of the health inequalities impact of flexicurity policies and how that affected (if at all) the interpretation of findings and implications for future research. Study participants The first question to be resolved is 'who is \"the public?\"' in the context of the evaluation of population-wide employ- ment policies. As the umbrella project was focused on inequalities in health, the EU commissioning brief identi- fied an additional need for 'further research on involving population groups with least power and resources, who are intended to be the ultimate beneficiaries of the research'.16 With this proviso and the population level context in mind, we made the following selection decisions:IL.Protectedbycopyright.BMJOpen:firstpublishedas./jbmopen--onApril.lDownoadedfromhttp://bmopen.bmjj.com/onJanuary,atiAcqusitionDepartmentiLbraryUnviof Anderson de Cuevas R, et al.

    "Those with low education and disabilities/ LLI were doubly disadvantaged. 2. Participants for this explorative qualitative study would be drawn from one European country: Sweden, from where the overall leadership of the flexicurity evaluation was based and which was representative of a recognised type of flexibility and security policy sys- tem (ie, low flexibility and high security).",
    "3. We needed to avoid 'tokenism', whereby a few low- skilled workers or unemployed people with disabili- ties were selected at random, without consideration of the nature of the research data they would be en- gaging with. Following discussions with Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) experts and deep knowl- edge of the health inequalities literature, we decided that it would be more appropriate to involve trade union representatives from blue-collar and white-col- lar unions as members of the relevant public. They were workers themselves but also had the added ex- perience of how their fellow workers in different so- cioeconomic circumstances and with different health conditions fared under the various national policies. They were also familiar with considering labour mar- ket trends at the population level.",
    "In addition, we decided to invite participation from representatives of other relevant public bodies, who could be more accurately termed 'stakeholder groups' rather than 'members of the public'. These stakeholders were members of: the Swedish employers' association (as the Swedish labour market is reliant to a great- er extent than elsewhere on collective agreements between trade unions and employers); the Swedish national employment agency (as the public body that implements policies to get unemployed people back to work and has a special remit for disabled and chronically ill workers); and politicians from the rul- ing coalition and opposition parties (who sat on a na- tional labour market committee).",
    "Study design and conduct The study component reported here comprised qual- itative research involving members of the public (as defined above) and stakeholder groups in the interpre- tation of research findings and reflections on future research. Four focused workshops with participants were held using a process developed by Petticrew and White- head.17 18 Trade union and stakeholder participants were identified from the research group's existing research users' network, using a snowballing technique. Potential participants were sent invitation letters, an outline of the research project and the objectives of the public involve- ment activity.",
    "Interested participants were given further information about the research and engagement activity through telephone conversations, face-to-face meetings and written correspondence. Open Access box 1 description of material presented at the focused workshops Participants were presented with a graph showing trends in Swedish employment rates of people with a limiting long-standing illness (LLI) and healthy people stratified by education level from 1990 to 2011, constructed from the Swedish Survey on Living Conditions and a blank timeline for the same period. Participants were then invited to chart important events or trends during this period on the timeline and to in- terpret developments in the employment of people with LLI and healthy people in the light of these events.",
    "Participants then compared graphs presenting differences in the employment rate of those with and without LLI and with high and low educational levels in Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands and the UK for the period 2005-2011 from European Union Statistics of Income and Living Conditions data (EU SILC, EUROSTAT). They commented and reflected on the situation in Sweden compared with the other three countries.",
    "The differential rate of 'poverty risk' (<60% of median income) among non-employed/employed people with LLI and employed healthy people was also presented in graphical form (EU SILC), and participants were asked to interpret changes in poverty risk in light of the key sociopolitical or economic events they had chart- ed on the timeline. Lastly, participants considered the categorisation of the UK, Netherlands and Denmark in relation to their degree of em- ployment protection and economic security (flexicurity) in a 2x2 matrix and reflected where to best position Sweden and the trajectory of the country's position over time.",

    "The 2008 reform of Swedish social insurance limited the time allowed for sickness absence and shifted a large group of people from social insurance to unemployment benefits. This was noted by the employment agency: [T]hose expelled from the insurance... the first batch ... - [I] think it was 4th January 2010 - ... 14,000 people suddenly came to the employment agency.",
    "The composition and size of the low educated group with LLI was also seen to have changed. The group had become smaller, as a result of the rise in the educational level of the general population and included a higher proportion of immigrants and people with mental ill-health. This was seen as another explanation for the group's lower employment rate: A large proportion of recent immigrants are very low educated or illiterate and of course they have greater difficulties [in securing employment] ... (Employment agency).",
    "Another employment agency employee said that it was harder for people with functional disabilities resulting from mental illness to find jobs: ... it is easier to adjust physically ... but if you have ADHD and forget your appointment time ... A change in workplace attitude towards people with disabilities was also mentioned as a factor contributing to the difficulty for low educated people with LLI to find employment: The climate has sort of become tougher.",
    "(Employment agency) What are the key policy changes in sweden that have influenced the employment of people with low education and llI from 1990 to 2010? Trade unionists suggested that changes in economic policy underpinned some of the trends in the employ- ment rate of low educated people with activity limitations due to health: I believe that the higher structural unemployment that results from prioritizing low inflation over low un- employment enables employers to pick and choose. And then they pick the high educated ... rather than the low educated.",
    "Deregulation of many different sectors was also mentioned: [The] taxi [industry] in Sweden is the most de-regu- lated in the world.",
    "Open Access Trade unionists felt that there had previously been much more emphasis on providing vocational training and continuing education for people with LLI who were not employed, whereas today individuals--particularly blue-collar workers--are simply urged to look for and obtain a job: ... you would think our government could step in and make sure these groups get at least an equal chance and support blue collar workers. Some participants, including trade union representa- tives, described how universal social security systems had been eroded over time.",
    "Unemployment insurance contri- butions had increased substantially, resulting in many employees leaving the scheme. Unemployment benefit levels had stagnated or been lowered, and social assis- tance benefits had plateaued.",
    "In parallel with the erosion of universal social security systems, collective agreements between employers and employees had changed, partly to compensate for this phenomenon. As one trade unionist put it: Security has moved to other arenas, because, for in- stance, if you don't increase the unemployment in- surance, it has moved to other types of insurance, that's how it is, then parts of the security system have moved.",
    "The 'other arenas' included collective agreements. During the discussion, the trade unionists explained that up to the 1990s, Sweden used to have national policies and security systems that would cater for all in the same way, in case of unemployment or redundancy.",
    "The active labour market policies (eg, retraining) bene- fited those with lower education. The unemployment insurance was quite generous and adequate (at least for those with low/normal incomes).",
    "However, over the years, as the benefit levels were not increased and active labour market policies were reduced, the different unions tried instead to supplement with their own insurances, linked to specific collective agreements. The white-collar unions with lower unemployment risk could negotiate better terms than blue-collar unions, and as a result, the differential increased further and became dependent on the unemployment risk. Those in the most marginal positions on the labour market (and not subscribing to the unemployment insurance) were even worse off.",
    "Employers mentioned another policy influence on people with LLI: an extension to the period of time an employer is responsible for paying sickness benefits for an absent employee, thereby increasing the cost to the employer. This policy change may have been detri- mental to the employment chances of persons with LLI. Other reforms to social security regulations, including the aforementioned restriction to the duration of sick- ness absence and also to eligibility for disability pension, were considered by many participants to be important policy changes aimed at incentivising work: IL.Protectedbycopyright.BMJOpen:firstpublishedas./jbmopen--onApril.lDownoadedfromhttp://bmopen.bmjj.com/onJanuary,atiAcqusitionDepartmentiLbraryUnviof Anderson de Cuevas R, et al.

Workshop participants were shown results comparing the prevalence of relative poverty among employed and non-employed people with LLI in Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands and the UK, for the years 2005 and 2010, respectively.",
    "In Sweden, the poverty rate had nearly doubled from 2005 to 2010 although from a very low starting point, whereas increases in the other countries, which started with higher poverty rates in 2005, were smaller. Some politicians questioned the validity of the measure 'relative poverty' (defined as having an income below 60% of the median national income): ... it describes an increasing income difference in so- ciety, but it says nothing about whether poverty has increased.",
    "These are two completely different things. Other participants attributed the increasing rates of relative poverty directly to national policies: ... it has been a deliberate policy ... to increase the differences in income according to whether you work or do not work, ...",
    "so you notice the change if you start working. (Employment agency) The social insurance reform of 2008 had excluded many non-employed people with LLI from sickness benefit, yet many were not on the unemployment register.",
    "The issue was how they made their living: ... they are somehow supported by relatives ... The group with mental problems ... seek social assistance more than others.",
    "(Employment agency) The increase in unemployment insurance contribu- tions (due to a change in government policy in 2007) led to many employees leaving the insurance and was also put forward as an explanation for rising rates of relative poverty among this population group: ... there are many unemployed people who are not part of the unemployment insurance scheme at all, and who don't get anything... . (Employment agency) Has Sweden moved to flexicurity?",
    "Workshop participants were asked whether they consid- ered that the policy changes that had taken place from 1990 to 2010 had moved Sweden to qualify as a 'flex- icure' country and were asked to place Sweden in a matrix of high/low flexibility and high/low economic security (figure 1). (Denmark, the Netherlands and the UK were positioned by the researchers prior to the workshops in line with the evidence from the policy literature.)",
    "Opinions were divided. One trade unionist commented: The whole of [Swedish] working life has slipped to- wards the UK",

    "the universal welfare system has been hollowed out since the 1990s. (Employer) Trade unionists and employers referred to a two-tier system, in which the situation for 'insiders' to the labour market--those who have had a job for some time, who are part of the unemployment insurance scheme and are covered by collective agreements--was much better than for those outside these arrangements. Most politicians commented that Sweden had high flexibility and high security, having moved from lower flexibility and even higher economic security.",

    "Impact of this involvement on researchers' interpretation of findings Subsequent to the focused workshops with public and stakeholder representatives, the wider research team comprising Swedish and UK members held reflective sessions to consider if, and how, the involvement activity had influenced their initial interpretation of findings or highlighted gaps in the evidence base. Four main insights were identified, triggered by the public and stakeholder involvement, which deepened our understanding of our findings and influenced subse- quent publications. First, was the extent to which people experiencing the labour market and welfare reforms first hand (at 'the coal face' so to speak) sensed more drastic and nuanced change in the Swedish welfare system over the past two decades than was evident from the academic literature reviews and policy analyses. The exercise resulting in figure 1 highlighted this point visually.",
    "Second, was the introduction of the concept of 'insiders' and 'outsiders' in the labour market, emerging from the workshops, particularly from discussions among trade unionists and employers. This highlighted the differing experiences and consequences for employees depending on socioeconomic status (SES) or simple blue- collar/white-collar dichotomy and on the length of time employees had had a job and whether they were part of the whole infrastructure that provided financial and job security.",
    "This concept fed into the generation of hypoth- eses to be tested in secondary data analysis, the results of which we subsequently published in a peer-reviewed paper.15 Third, was the possibility of differential effect of collec- tive agreements for different occupational groups. It was the deep understanding by unions and employers of how collective agreements had operated in practice over the Open Access years that offered the researchers fresh insights into how groups that were already disadvantaged could be hardest hit by poorer, or no, collective agreements. This led to the development of a research proposal on the role of collec- tive agreements in contributing to differential impacts of labour market policies, which was submitted by the research team to a Swedish Research Counsil: FORTE.",
    "from Fourth, the triangulation of perspectives different public and stakeholder groups gave a much fuller picture of what was happening as a result of the interactions of people with the system. The trade unions and employers raised issues about the consequences of collective agreements as detailed above. The employ- ment agency described from first-hand experience the impact of changing policies on the lives and finances of unemployed people, particularly those who were 'outsiders'.",
    "The politicians understood, from their own experience of legislating the stated and real reasons for changes in policies and the intended and unintended consequences.IL.Protectedbycopyright. dIsCussIOn",
    "This is a rare example of a study exploring what differ- ence public and stakeholder involvement makes to an evaluation of a natural policy experiment to influence the wider social determinants of health. Furthermore, it was conducted in a European country outside the UK, where the concept of lay involvement is less developed. To our knowledge, this is also the first report of involving the public and stakeholders in population-wide epidemi- ological studies, which require interpretation of national quantitative datasets.4 Reservations have been expressed elsewhere about the difficulties of involving the public in research that is highly technical.23 Added to that was the population-wide nature of the policies being evaluated. Our decisions on who to involve and how were therefore critical to the whole research endeavour reported here.",
    "Our final selection of trade union representatives from blue-collar and white- collar unions as the most appropriate members of the relevant public, coupled with the decision to involve stake- holders from the employers' organisation, public employ- ment office and politicians serving on employment policy committees, proved both feasible and productive. Partici- pants in the focused workshops demonstrated a high level of lay expertise and a capacity to engage with the intrica- cies of policy developments, changes to the economy, the country's demographic profile and global market forces, from both a practical and a theoretical perspective. They expressed appreciation of the way the study findings were presented to them for comment--as 'big trends over time'-- rather than facing them, for example, with the technical- ities of the epidemiological analysis.",
    "There is continuing debate about how to facilitate lay involvement in research and at what point would be most appropriate.24-26 The focused workshops reported here provide an example of what helped public and stakeholder involvement in the BMJOpen:firstpublishedas./jbmopen--onApril.lDownoadedfromhttp://bmopen.bmjj.com/onJanuary,atiAcqusitionDepartmentiLbraryUnviof Anderson de Cuevas R, et al.

The study concluded that this public and stakeholder involvement benefited the interpretation of the research findings and conceptualisation of future research in a number of ways. Participants sensed more drastic and nuanced change in the Swedish welfare system over recent decades than was evident from our literature reviews and policy analysis.",
    "They also elaborated hidden developments in the Swedish labour market that were increasingly leading to 'insiders' and 'outsiders', with differing experiences and consequences for financial and job security. The explanation by the trade unionists and employers of the differential effects of the various collec- tive agreements for different occupational groups was new and had not been a focus in the studies performed by the researchers. The first-hand experience of the employ- ment agency provided new insights into how changes to the social protection system were contributing to the increasing trends in poverty among unemployed people with LLI. The politicians provided further reasoning behind some of the policy changes and their intended and unintended consequences.",
    "These insights fed into our subsequent reporting of the results of the flexicurity evaluation,15 27 28 as well as the conceptualisation of new research that could be pursued in a future programme (see below). limitations The main limitation was that public and stakeholder involvement was limited to one discrete phase of the research process: the interpretation of initial findings. There is some evidence to suggest that involving the public throughout the research process (as well as long- term involvement and continuity of membership beyond a single research project) enhances impact.4 29 30 While we judged involvement in this discrete phase to be the most practical and logical starting point faced with the specific population-wide policy evaluation of flexicurity, it became clear during the focused workshops that this could also be a way of building a continued relationship for future research. The research ideas coming out of the work- shops and the willingness on the part of participants to be involved in a future programme laid the groundwork for involvement in future research from the very begin- ning, including the conceptualisation of the research questions.",
    "A higher level limitation is that research on public and stakeholder involvement is inherently context specific, as the impact of involvement is likely to depend on many factors, including the topic being studied, the public groups being represented, the perspective of the researchers and the extent of involvement. Producing generalisable evidence in the area of public involve- ment is inherently difficult. This study was conducted in the context of Sweden and its labour market and social protection system.",
    "Mindful of this, we tried to tailor the public and stakeholder involvement initiatives to take account of the country context (Sweden), the topic (poli- cies around flexicurity) and the nature of the research in which involvement is being encouraged (population-wide epidemiological studies). In this type of research, under- standing and taking account of the context is essential if the findings are to be of value to research users in Sweden and elsewhere. Input into the conceptualisation stage of future research The public and stakeholder involvement, although only at the interpretation of findings stage for the current research, gave rise to new research questions to address in a future research programme. Could it therefore be a way of intro- ducing public involvement right from the conceptualisation stage in future population-wide epidemiological studies of this nature? Ideas for future research that came out of the public and stakeholder involvement included the following.",
    "First, was the question of how the changing composition of, and the increasing prevalence of neuropsychiatric diseases in, the group of low educated people with LLI might affect the employment chances of the group. This is an interesting issue to pursue in view of the increasing demand for social skills on the labour market including in lower skilled jobs.",
    "Another idea for future studies came from the unionists, regarding the differential conditions associated with different collective agreements, stating that 'security has moved to other arenas', that is, from the national level to the level of specific agreements negotiated by individual unions. Here, detailed assessment of conditions pertaining to different groups of manual workers, compared with conditions among higher non-manual employees, could help identify differential impacts and trajectories of different groups in the event of unemployment. This idea has been worked up, jointly with participants, into a research proposal, which was submitted to a Swedish Research Counsil: FORTE.",
    "Third, the employment agency offered the use of their more detailed data to study the employment and economic situation of specific groups, such as people with psychological illnesses, whose employment prospects and economic situation may be poorer than among those with physical illnesses, not least following recent restrictions in social insurance policies. Hence, early contacts with the public and with stake- holders, who day to day face the concrete impact of new policies or other changes on the labour market, may be very pertinent to specifying research questions addressing the impact of such real life changes.",
    "Increased involvement and dialogue with the public and with stakeholders in the iden- tification and framing of specific research questions may therefore contribute both to increased scientific rigour, as well as societal relevance of policy-oriented research. COnClusIOn",

However, in many countries including Tanzania, much emphasis has been directed towards human resources for health with the total exclusion of human resources for health research. The objective of this study was to systematically investigate the capacity building process for the Tanzanian National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR) over a 30-year period and identify the challenges and opportunities in creating a critical mass of multi-disciplinary research scientists that is required for achieving the intended health benefits.",
    "A desk review of personnel database information covering 1980-2009 on academic qualifications, training, research was conducted for experience and research output.

    "Interviews were conducted with a cross section of researchers on capacity development aspects using a self-administered questionnaire. In-depth interviews were also conducted with the current and former NIMR Management to seek information on capacity development challenges.",
    "A review was also done on staff personal files, annual reports, strategic plans and other occasional documents. A total of 163 CV were assessed; of these, 76.7% (125) were for Research Scientists (RS), 20.9% (34) Laboratory Technologists (LT) and 2.4% (4) for System Analysts.",
    "The Institute had 13 research scientists upon its establishment. Since 1980, NIMR has recruited a total of 185 Research Scientists. By 2009, NIMR had a total scientific workforce of 170 staff (RS= 82.4%; LT= 17.6%). Of the 140 RSs, 37 (26.4%) were first degree; 77 (55.5%) second degree while 26 (18.6%) were PhD degree holders.",
    "Of the total of 78 researchers interviewed, 55 (70.5%) indicated to have accessed postgraduate training through their personal efforts and 23 through institutional arrangement. Sixty (77%) respondents were satisfied with their tenure at NIMR. Seventy (89%) indicated that they had not at any point considered leaving NIMR.",
    "Most (79%) research scientists were recruited while holding a first degree, a few (17%) with second degree while only one (0.7%) holding a PhD degree. NIMR has experienced a research scientist attrition rate of 17.5%. Staff retention factors included availability of training opportunities; passion for conducting research; and good career prospects.",
    "Despite having a training programme, the institute has never at any moment been able to hold its own training resources. Being a public research institution, NIMR receives its core funding from the government of the United Republic of Tanzania. The bulk of the funding appears to be spent on personnel emoluments that take up to 85% (mean= 66%) of the allocated budget. In conclusion, the current NIMR's research capacity building is dependent mainly on foreign funding and personal initiatives. There is an urgent need to increase local funding for capacity building and conduct of research.",

    "Human resource for health research is considered as the most important resource ingredient. Building the capacity to carry out multidisciplinary research is considered a priority for health researchers if developing countries like Tanzania are to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 (Haines, 2003; Lee et al., 2004). However, emphasis has been directed towards human resources for health (HRH) with the total exclusion of human resources for health research (HRHR). Very often \"research\" is only mentioned in the context of either academic or research and development institutions, but human resources for health research are not given attention at all (Ijsselmudien, 2007).",
    "Like in other developing countries, there is a paucity of information on HRHR in Tanzania, leading to a situation where HRHR are not planned for in a meaningful manner, not measured nor monitored, nor specifically resourced. Cognizant of the situation, the global ministerial forum on research for health has emphasized the need for developing HRHR as a means for sustainable development (The Bamako Call to Action on Research for Health, 2008). The Algiers Declaration of 2008, on the other hand commits African governments to work towards strengthening national health research systems, national information and knowledge management through optimization of investments.",
    "Countries are expected to support development of human resources through training and access to scientific information. In addition they are to allocate at least 2% of national health expenditure and at least 5% of external aid for health to research and research capacity building and invest more in research aimed at improving health systems.",

    "Specifically, the study aimed to (i) establish the current HRHR capacity of NIMR; (ii) track research capacity development processes and identify challenges encountered in trying to create a critical mass of researchers; and (iii) analyze the prevailing HRHR development plans and propose strategies for accelerated achievement of a critical mass of scientists. To address these specific objectives, a number of questions were raised: (i) What is the current HRHR capacity at NIMR in terms of numbers, skills mix and expertise?",
    "(ii) Is the current HRHR capacity sufficient to enable it to adequately address the MDGs and its mandate as spelled out in the NIMR Act? (iii) Is the current HRHR capacity sufficient to enable it to adequately respond to the current Institutional strategic plan?",
    "(iv) Are there capacity development plans in place to address the HRHR needs of the institute; and (v) how is the institutional health research capacity building process being funded?

The Institute mandated among other things: (a) to carry out, and promote the carrying out of medical research designed to alleviate disease among the people of Tanzania; (b) to carry out research into various aspects of local traditional medical practices for the purpose of facilitating the development and application of herbal medicine; (c) in cooperation with the Government or any person or body of persons, to promote, or provide facilities for, the training of local personnel for carrying out scientific research into medical problems; (d) to monitor, control and coordinate medical research carried out within Tanzania, or elsewhere on behalf of or for the benefit of the Government of Tanzania, and to evaluate the findings of that research; (e) to establish a system for the registration of, and to register, the findings of medical research carried out within Tanzania, and promote the practical application of those findings for the purpose of improving or advancing the health and general welfare of the people of Tanzania; and (f) to establish and operate a system of documentation and dissemination of information on any aspect of the medical research carried out by or on behalf of the Institute.",
    "Data collection The methodology used in this study adopted the health research capacity matrix developed by COHRED (Montorzi et al., 2009). To establish the current HRHR capacity of NIMR, a desk review of research personnel database was conducted for information on academic qualifications, training, research experience and research outputs in terms of publications.",
    "A review of research personnel data was obtained from the Human Resources Department and it covered a period from 1980 to 2009. The current curriculum vitae (CV) of staff were also reviewed to gather information for each researcher on employment record, training, training support, area of expertise and scientific output.",
    "For the purpose of this study, researchers included those employed as research assistants, research scientists, health laboratory technologists and systems analysts. Interviews were conducted with a cross-section of researchers on capacity development aspects.",
    "Scientists and technologists were categorized (based on the institutional scheme of service) into three levels; that of junior, mid career and senior scientists. For scientists, cadres from Research Assistant to Research Scientist III were categorized as junior scientists. From Research Scientist 1 to Senior Research Scientist I as mid-career scientists and from Principal Research Scientist to Chief Research Scientist were categorized as Senior Scientists.",
    "As for the technologist cadre, Health Laboratory Technologist III to Health Laboratory Technologist I were categorized as junior technologists. From Senior Health Laboratory Technologist III to Senior Health Laboratory Technologist I as mid-career technologists while from Principal Health Laboratory Technologist to Chief Health Laboratory Technologist as Senior Technologists. A sample of two staff of each category, from each of the NIMR centres was interviewed.",
    "At the time of this exercise, NIMR was made up of six centres. Since there were a few Systems Analysts, only one from each centre was interviewed.",
    "In addition, in depth interviews were conducted with the current and former NIMR Director Generals, Director of Finance and Administration, Director of Research Coordination and Promotion, Director of Information Technology and Communication, Centre Directors and Principal Administrative Officer to seek their experiences and opinion on capacity development challenges. Additional information on personnel was obtained from the Human Resources Department where a database with information on current and old staff is maintained.",

    "A self administered questionnaire was sent out to 85 staff requesting information through 19 questions. Data analysis Data was entered onto computer using Epi-Info database. Double entry was made by two data entry clerks and the two databases cross-checked for inconsistencies. Data cleaning was done and where necessary verification of information was done on the original data sheets.",
    "Analysis was done using STATA version 8.0 (Stata Corp. LP, TX, USA). Since the study has adopted the COHRED matrix approach, the following parameters were used as outcome measures in assessing the case study: (i) Recruitment, training, rewarding and retention of research staff; (ii) Setting of institutional research priorities; (iii) Partnerships, collaborations and networks developed; (iv) Establishment of research infrastructure; (v) Research performance in terms of scientific research publications in peer reviewed journals; (vi) Financing of Health Research and capacity building; (vii) Development of Institutional capacity for Monitoring and Evaluation of research activities.",
    "Each of these datasets from the above sources was analyzed and where necessary validation was done by triangulation with other data-sources. To track development in capacity building, data collected was broken down into periods of ten years beginning in 1980.",
    "The tracking focused on number of scientists employed, number of scientific staff trained, number of publications, capacity of research laboratories at research centres and levels of staff attrition. Results Initial capacity building endeavours The Institute had 13 research scientists upon its inception, most of them inherited from the former East African Research Council Institutions.",
    "Among these few, it was only the first Director General, Prof. Wen Kilama who was a PhD holder. The low number of scientific staff when NIMR was established resulted from the fact that most scientists during the East African Community days were from Kenya, Uganda and UK. Following the break-up of the community, all of them returned to their respective countries except one Ugandan. As the first Director General rightly put it during the interview; 'it was very unfortunate that the institute was established in 1979 which was also the beginning of what came to be known as Africa's lost decade\" (Prof. W.L. Kilama).",
    "He added that \"The first cheque from the Ministry of Health meant for establishing the institute for the first quarter of the year was worth TShs 30,000.00 (c. US$ 6,000.00 at that time). This was to cover all staff salaries, utilities, running of vehicles and renovation of the dilapidated buildings that were provided for the Institute head offices.",
    "To put it simply, the government had no money to spare for the institute\" The very demanding task for building research capacity was obvious right from the beginning. Understanding that the government simply had no money, the Director General had to look outside for support in building capacity for the institute. The first call was made to the World Health Organization/World Bank Programme for Research on Tropical Diseases (WHO- TDR).",
    "There was good response with a team being sent from Geneva to carry out a needs assessment for the Institute. This resulted into the first major grant worth US$ 200,000 in 1982. It was this grant that enabled research activities to be initiated by NIMR.",
    "The very initial challenge that the institute faced was lack of potential candidates on the job market. In 1982, there was only one university in the country, the University of Dar es Salaam. The university produced no more than 20 medical and less than 50 life science graduates per year. In order to build a strong scientific base, the institute set very high criteria for researchers Tanzania Journal of Health Research Volume 13 (Suppl 1), December 2011 DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/thrb.v13i1.11 to be employed.",
    "This required one to qualify with a first class or upper second class degree in order to be considered for a research position. New employees had to be on probation for 12 months (versus six months for public service). This decision created a very stiff competition for the few highly competent candidates between NIMR and other employers, including the University itself.",
    "The early years found NIMR losing out to other competitors mainly due to low awareness to research as a career in addition to the comparatively low remuneration that NIMR could offer. Current Human Resources for Health Research Capacity Over the years, NIMR has recruited a total of 185 research scientists. At the time of this study, NIMR had a total scientific and technical workforce of 170 staff.",
    "Research Scientists accounted for 82.4% (140) while Laboratory Technologists accounted for 17.6% (30) of the scientific staff. Among these there were 30 female Research Scientists and 2 female Laboratory Technologists making up 20% of the scientific workforce. Of the 140 Research Scientists, 37 (26.4%) were first degree holders; 76 (55.5%) second degree holders while 26 (18.6%) were PhD degree holders.",
    "The results show that most staffs (79%) were recruited while holding a first degree, a few (17%) with second degree while only one (0.7%) holding a PhD degree. Fifty-three staff recruited with first degree had a second degree while the other 21 had PhDs at the time of this study. A total of four staff recruited with a second degree are now PhD holders; two Diploma and 1 Certificate holder at time of recruitment are now second degree holders. A total of 37 staff recruited with a first degree has not been able to acquire additional qualifications since recruitment. Considering those who had left NIMR for whatever reason, 11 had first degree, 16 second degree while 18 left at a time when they already acquired PhD qualifications.",
    "These results show that NIMR has been able to successfully support its' staff to train to high academic qualifications.

    "Despite being able to train its staff, NIMR has faced a number of challenges in ensuring appropriate training is provided to its staff. The Institute has a training programme, however, it had never at any moment been able to hold its own training resources. It has depended entirely on overseas support for its staff training through bilateral or multilateral agreements and recently through funded research programmes. This has made it almost impossible for NIMR to stick to its training programme and sometimes leading to staff going for training that are not of priority to the institute. So far most training during the first decade (1980-1989) was supported through WHO/TDR institutional support grants, Swiss Development Cooperation, British Council and the Swedish International Development Agency/Secretariat for Research Cooperation (Sida/SAREC).",
    "Training opportunities and job satisfaction A total of 163 curriculum vitae of scientific staff were accessed from the NIMR records. These included staff in current and previous employment.",
    "Of the 163 CV, 76.7% (125) were for Research Scientists, 20.9% (34) Laboratory Technologists and 2.4% (4) for Systems analysts. A total of 78 Tanzania Journal of Health Research Volume 13 (Suppl 1), December 2011 DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/thrb.v13i1.11 questionnaires were administered to a cross-section of selected scientific staff.",
    "Fifty-five (70.5%) respondents indicated that they did access postgraduate training through their personal efforts and only 23 got such opportunities through institutional arrangement with collaborators. A good proportion of respondents (45%) were not aware of the existence of the NIMR training programme, possibly because it has not been functional.",
    "Sixty (77%) respondents indicated to be satisfied with their tenure at NIMR, with a small proportion expressing poor job satisfaction. More interesting were the responses to the question on whether the respondents had ever considered leaving NIMR for a different employer. Seventy (89%) indicated that they had not at any point considered leaving NIMR whereas eight (11%) had at some point considered leaving NIMR. Regarding motivating factors keeping most staff at NIMR, the three reasons that came up more frequently included availability of training opportunities; passion for conducting research; good career prospects with open competition and improved remuneration.",
    "The late 1980s to early 1990s were difficult with hardly a handful of training opportunities coming by. This was followed by a change in mid-1990s when a broader opportunity opened up with more potential funders for research and training. Whereas the first decade was characterised by isolated individual training scholarships, beginning in the mid-nineties this acquired a different approach where more training opportunities were available through major research programmes that were developed between NIMR and its collaborators.",
    "This opened up with programmes that had multiple training opportunities such as the Enhancement of Research Capacity (ENRECA) Programme funded by Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA); Gates Malaria Partnership funded by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; the Joint Malaria Programme initially funded by the British Medical Research Council and later by multiple funders industries; Tanzania - Netherlands Research on AIDS including (TANERA)/Tanzania - Netherlands Support on AIDS (TANESA) programmes funded by the Netherlands Government; Bergen University Training Agreement funded by NORAD; Mwanza Intervention Trials Unit (MITU) funded by the Medical Research Council of UK. the pharmaceutical Recruitment, compensation and retention of Human Resources for Health Research Traditionally, the recruitment of human resources for health research at NIMR has been based on the institute being an equal opportunity employer.",
    "The recruitment process has been open and transparent where advertisements are put in the media and potential applicants are invited to apply. The applicants are then shortlisted and invited for interviews that are conducted by a panel which often brings on board experts from outside NIMR. Research scientists are initially recruited on a 12-month probation period, after which they may be confirmed on permanent and pensionable terms. Recruitment is guided by the NIMR scheme of service and requirements for personnel as identified by the Institute.",
    "Of recent, it has been necessary for NIMR to request for permission from both the Central Establishment and Treasury for funding of the positions. This has created a major hitch since it has always been difficult for Treasury to approve all NIMR placement requirements due to shortage of funding.",
    "Analysis of the entry qualifications of staff showed that recruitment of the first cohort from 1980 - 1999 was very stringent, sticking to those candidates with first or upper second class or with non-classified degrees such as medical and veterinary medicine. Data showed that some years would pass without any recruitment if highly qualified candidates were not available on the market. Recruitment of the latter cohort 2000-2009 did not seem to be that stringent as it included less qualified staff, despite the job market having grown bigger due to a large increase of university graduates compared to earlier years.",
    "There were also indications of poor recruitment planning leading to massive recruitment of 29 medical doctors (out of 40 recruits) between 2005 and 2008 purportedly with the intention of strengthening clinical research. A quick analysis shows that at the time of the survey, hardly five of these recruits were interested in clinical research and were currently focussing on other research areas.",
    "With the increasing Tanzania Journal of Health Research Volume 13 (Suppl 1), December 2011 DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/thrb.v13i1.11 number of research projects, it has been necessary to hire additional research staff on short term contracts due to difficulties in obtaining clearance for formal recruitment from the Treasury. This has provided another opportunity for observing young research assistants for their potential as future lead researchers.",
    "The NIMR compensation offered to research scientists have been relatively poor until recently when the implementation of the harmonised public researcher scheme of service coordinated by Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology was put in place in July 2008. Prior to these changes, the NIMR compensation scheme was based on that of parastatal organisations that included mostly state owned income generating institutions. Such institutions were capable of putting in place additional incentives that improved compensation for their staff.",
    "This made compensation to NIMR scientists much inferior than that of their counterparts in parastatal organisations as well as central government employees. As indicated by some interviewees, \"we had to remain in NIMR employment those days not for money, but simply because of our passion for scientific research\". The recent changes through the scheme of service for researchers aimed at harmonising and improving compensation for scientific staff employed in the public research institutions.",
    "The scheme has put researchers almost at par with university academic staff in order to increase competitiveness between the two types of institutions. Currently, compensation for research scientists range from TShs 841,340.00 (US$561) per month for a newly recruited Research Assistant up to TShs 3,730,590.00 (US$ 2,487) per month for Chief Research Scientist. Promotion from Research Assistant to Chief Research Scientist is purely on merit, based on training and publications by the respective scientist. Efforts to put in place a formal retention scheme for NIMR staff has been made with the development of a staff retention scheme in 2006.",
    "The very elaborate scheme was approved by the NIMR Council, but could not be implemented due to lack of funding. The analysis showed that over the 30-year period, NIMR has experienced a research scientist attrition rate of 17.5%. This translates to a mean of 0.6% attrition rate per year. Breaking down the analysis by cohort shows that there was a high attrition in the first cohort with an overall attrition rate of 37% or 1.2% per annum. The second cohort has an overall attrition rate of 15% or 0.78% per annum while the third cohort has an overall attrition rate of 6.8% or 0.75% per annum.",
    "Research Output The standard measure of a research organizations' output has traditionally been in terms of number and quality of publications; grants awarded and more recently in terms of patents registered.",
    "There is currently no formal register for the few patents that NIMR research scientists have participated in developing and registering in collaboration with foreign partners. In addition, detailed information on research grants won by NIMR scientists was not found to be comprehensive enough for the purpose.",
    "The number and to a lesser extent the quality of scientific publications was therefore chosen as the best measure of research output for NIMR scientists. A total of 646 scientific articles were published by NIMR scientists alone or in collaboration with partners between 1980 and 2009 (Figure 1).",
    "The number of publications has likewise grown steadily with the number of research scientists, from 4 publications a year with a peak in 2001 with 57 publications. Despite the increase in number of publications by the years, the output has not at all been that encouraging when considered in terms of per capita publications. The best performance was achieved in year 2001 with 0.69 publications per scientist per year!",

The journals that published over a total of ten or more articles by NIMR scientists over the period included Acta Tropica, AIDS, American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, Annals of Tropical Medicine & Parasitology, BMC Health Services Research, BMC Public Health, Journal of Infectious Diseases, Infection and Immunology, Lancet, Malaria and Infectious Diseases in Africa, Malaria Journal, Research Journal of Medical Sciences, Sexually Transmitted Infection, Tanzania Journal of Health Research, Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, Tropical Medicine and International Health and Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.",
    "A few articles have as well appeared in very high impact point journals. These include the British Journal of Ophthalmology, British Journal of Nutrition, European Journal of Clinical Nutrition, Genome, Journal of Immunology, Molecular Biology and Evolution, Science, Molecular Immunology, New England Journal of Medicine, Nature, Parasitology, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA and Trends in Parasitology.",
    "NIMR has in 1997 established the publication and production of a quarterly peer reviewed journal, Tanzania Journal of Health Research formally known as Tanzania Health Research Bulletin. This journal targets scientists, policy/ decision makers and the general public. The Journal publishes original papers, review articles or short communications on biomedical, health sciences and policy and planning.",
    "It has so far provided a popular platform for dissemination of health research information in the country and beyond. Tanzania Journal of Health Research Volume 13 (Suppl 1), December 2011 DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/thrb.v13i1.11 To enhance scientific communication, NIMR has since 1983 coordinated and hosted an Annual Joint Scientific Conference and occasional symposia.",
    "The annual joint scientific conferences are events that provide a forum for researchers, practitioners, trainers, decision and policy makers, media and representatives of special groups to share research results and experiences in issues related to health and health research. The event has over the years become the largest gathering of health research scientists in Tanzania that attracts significant participants locally and from abroad. It has therefore become an important forum for exchange of health research information in the country.",
    "Skills mix Right from its establishment, NIMR's focus has been on research towards communicable diseases, mainly parasitic diseases like malaria, schistosomiasis, onchocerciasis, sleeping sickness, lymphatic filariasis and intestinal helminths. Efforts were immediately directed towards HIV/AIDS following the pandemic during the mid-1980s.",
    "The decision did make a lot of sense since these communicable diseases were and are still the major public health problems to-date. Despite such a focus, not all essential elements of these diseases have been covered so far. Some cross-cutting disciplines were received late, social sciences and statistics first began to be developed in the early 1990s. Health systems, health economics and health policy, and geographical information systems are still at infancy stage, despite their importance in the success of disease interventions.",
    "Of 163 CVs of research scientists examined, only 39 were bold enough to state clearly their skills and areas of expertise. Most CVs at most provided some outline of \"research experience\" or \"participation in research activities\".",
    "The few scientists who indicated their areas of competence and from the publications list, indicates NIMR so far has accumulated a wealth of expertise in malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, schistosomiasis, neglected tropical diseases and intestinal helminths. There is a wealth of expertise in the epidemiology and control of these diseases, with a budding expertise in basic sciences as modern laboratories are being established. Another rapidly growing area is in clinical research, particularly case management, drug and vaccine trials.",
    "One aspect that appeared limiting was the number and quality of laboratory technologists in NIMR employment. As it is now, whereas NIMR is having a good number of qualified scientists, laboratory technologists are not well trained. The most senior technologists were mere diploma holders albeit without further specialised training. It is as late as in 2008 that two young laboratory technologists completed their first degrees in laboratory sciences.",
    "Looking at the numbers, in a situation where there are 140 research scientists (26 with PhD), there are only 30 laboratory technologists to support them. Training and mentorship The analysis indicates that NIMR is doing very well in getting its staff trained for higher degrees. Out of the current 26 PhDs, in service at least 25 (96%) were trained while with NIMR and 53 out of 76 MSc holders (70%) were trained while in NIMR employment. Most of the 37 scientists with first degree are those who joined the organisation over the last two to three years.",
    "According to the NIMR Director of Finance and Administration; \"these are also likely to go for post-graduate training soon\". NIMR has in place a training programme for its staff, \"however it has been difficult to implement it due to lack of resources\" (Principal Administrative Officer).",
    "The Government of Tanzania has over the years, been providing very little funds for training. These resources have been found to be inadequate particularly for PhD training in biomedical sciences which is expensive. The little training resources have therefore been used for cheaper training of non-scientific staff. Almost all training for scientists was therefore funded from foreign sources.",
    "This has either been from capacity strengthening grants, bilateral agreements or through open competition scholarships. Tanzania Journal of Health Research Volume 13 (Suppl 1), December 2011 DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/thrb.v13i1.11 At NIMR's inception, there was a lot of goodwill and the institute had almost open opportunities with very few candidates to take them up.",
    "This continued up to the mid to late 1980s when due to the world economic trends and Africa being in economic doldrums, such opportunities were not easily forthcoming. With the changes in mid-1990s, new initiatives and more research funds to support large research programmes came into being.",
    "As a result NIMR got more training opportunities for MSc and PhD through the ENRECA, Mema kwa Vijana, Joint Malaria Programme, Gates Malaria Partnership, Bergen University Training Agreement, Mwanza Intervention Trial Unit, MCTA, Afrique 1, TRHiVE and similar programmes. This change was more convenient for higher degree training since it provided better environment for research training as scholars pursued their training within a structured research programme. Since all these programmes were collaborative, scholars had access to both local and external mentorship that further strengthened the training.",
    "During the interviews, it became apparent that although the first cohort of research scientists got immediate training after recruitment to MSc and PhD levels, they had difficulties in attracting funds and engaging in research activities due to lack of immediate senior scientists to provide mentorship and guidance. They therefore had to \"fend for themselves\", which was not easy to most of them. Perhaps this contributed to the relatively high staff attrition in that cohort.",
    "The few who remained are the current senior scientists who are expected to mentor junior scientists. However, their previous experience has possibly denied them the capacity to be able to deliver as mentors, thus adversely affecting local mentorship of research scientists. Currently, there is however a newly observed trend where senior scientists have over the last five years been actively involved in the supervision of fellow junior scientists for their MSc and PhD training, further promoting mentorship culture in the institute.",
    "Health Research Priorities NIMR health research priorities are structurally guided by the Act of Parliament establishing the Institute (URT, 1979) which stipulates the mandate entrusted to the institute in the country's health research portfolio. Another guiding principle is that of the national health research priorities and lately the institutional strategic plans that were crafted and put into use by the NIMR for the first time in 1997 (NIMR, 1997). The country's health research priority setting process is led by NIMR through the Tanzania National Health Research (TANHER)",
    "Forum. The first such exercise was conducted in 1992 through a participatory process as detailed by Montorzi et al. (2009). The process sets national priorities for a 5-years' periods to be used by health researchers including NIMR as a platform for their research plans and priorities.",
    "Financing research capacity building Being a public research institution, NIMR receives its core funding from the government of the United Republic of Tanzania. Table 2 summarises the amount of funding that NIMR has received from the government over the past ten years (2000/01 to 2009/10).",
    "The bulk of the funding appears to be spent on personnel emoluments that take up to 85% (mean 66%) of the allocated budget. Focusing on research funding, the highest was recorded in 2006/07 at 19% of the allocation. However, very disappointing is the fact that for the past five years (2005/06-2009/10), there has been zero allocation to NIMR for research from the government of Tanzania! Over the years, the NIMR budget was equivalent to 3-6% of the total budget of the Ministry of Health.",

NIMR has been able to forge links with a number of collaborators with whom they put together applications for research grants that are submitted to various funding bodies.",
    "Others have included partnerships through various networks that support research and capacity building activities (Table 3). The most recent data over the last two years show that whereas the Government of Tanzania through the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare provided a total core budget of TShs 6,048,117,971 and TShs 7,918,283,664 in fiscal years 2007/08 and 2008/09, respectively, NIMR and its collaborators mobilised TShs 7,233,354,144 and TShs 8,590,280,130 from external sources during the same periods for research and capacity building.",

    "Ideally, a researcher should be trained through research training at least up to the level of doctorate degree, followed by intensive mentorship from senior researchers. The fact that the job market had difficulty providing first degree holders, there was an urgent need for the institute to put in place a framework for immediate training of recruited staff.",
    "As health problems becomes more complex due to new, emerging and re-emerging diseases, pandemics such as HIV/AIDS, multi-drug resistance among pathogens, health research is therefore becoming increasingly multidisciplinary. Weaknesses in health systems of most countries' national health systems (NHS) in both developed and developing countries have compounded the situation such that it has become difficult to interrupt disease transmission even when and where effective tools are already available for intervention.",
    "This situation has made it extremely important that research institutions develop and maintain a critical mass of scientists who would be able to address the health problems more effectively. The term \"critical mass\" is used here to refer to \"a size, number or amount large enough to produce a particular result\" (Merriam Webster online search Dictionary, 2009).",
    "This necessitates research organizations such as NIMR to develop research scientists that cover a broad range of expertise, in sufficient quantities that would enable it to adequately address the countries' health problems. Nchinda (2002) observes a mismatch between the increased disease and health burden and the technical and human capacity of developing countries to either harness the existing knowledge or generate new knowledge to combat these diseases and health problems through research. He considers it extremely important that developing countries such as Tanzania develop indigenous research capacity that would enable them Tanzania Journal of Health Research Volume 13 (Suppl 1), December 2011 DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/thrb.v13i1.11 undertake studies in their own national settings that would lead to appropriate control strategies.",
    "The only sure way of developing and maintaining such a critical mass of researchers is through capacity building. The National Institute for Medical Research is currently implementing its 3rd Five Year Strategic Plan (NIMR, 2008a). The plan aims at (a) improving translation, dissemination and utilization of research findings (b) strengthening the system of protecting intellectual property and institutional ownership of research findings and (c) improve scheme of service and modify organizational structure so as to develop, motivate and retain research staff.",
    "Currently, the major research areas of focus include malaria, sexually transmitted infections, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, health systems, schistosomiasis, trypanosomiasis, helminthiases, non-communicable diseases and traditional medicine. Most research carried out by NIMR is guided by the National Health Research Priorities. Despite this diversified research protocol, while the institute is relatively strong in malaria and HIV/AIDS research, is still weak in other research areas (Mboera, 2010).",
    "A number of factors at system, institutional and individual levels have been observed to influence research capacity building. A recent investigation conducted by Barret & Nakabugo (2008) categorized these into enhancing and limiting factors.",
    "Research and innovation has made significant contributions to the development of solutions to health problems and to the advancement of human health worldwide. The nature of research and innovation for health improvement has become increasingly multidisciplinary, interconnected and inter-sectoral. In order to conduct relevant effective research, national institutions ought to build research capacity through developing and retaining a critical mass of scientists who can handle the current challenges.",
    "A clear understanding of the current status of HRHR against the impending environment becomes crucial. The NIMR per capita publication output may sound very dismal. However, it appears to compare favourably with that of the most reputable research institution in Africa; the South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC, 2008). The 2007/2008 Annual Report of the SAMRC registered 705 and 528 peer-reviewed publications in 2007 and 2008, respectively.",
    "The SAMRC had a total of 874 staff members of whom 431 were funded through contracts and 443 were baseline funded. This makes the per-capita output estimated at 0.80-1.59 and 0.61-1.22 publications per scientist per year for 2008 and 2007, respectively when considering both contract staff and baseline staff or baseline staff only. Despite this parity in per-capita publication output, the SAMRC has an edge over NIMR in terms of innovation and technology transfer whereby in 2007, SAMRC had four new patents registered, two disclosures made and one new start-up company established (SAMRC, 2008).",
    "It could be worth noting that, Tanzania is ranked among the best ten countries with high volume of health literature citations in Sub Saharan Africa, South Africa included (Hoffman, 2009). NIMR is known to make a significant contribution to these numbers (Mboera, 2010).",
    "In 1997, NIMR through the Tanzania Health Users' Trust Fund, established Tanzania Journal of Health Research as tool to make relevant and current health information available to scientists, practitioners, policy and decision-makers, as well as the public in Tanzania and beyond. This open-access Journal publishes original and review articles on health research. Over the years, the journal has provided a popular platform for dissemination of health research information in the country and beyond (Mboera, 2010). It is worth noting here that this is an outstanding success since health research is currently the only sector to have an on-line, open access international peer reviewed journal published in the country (Montorzi et al., 2009).",
    "Skills mix in any organization is considered to be a potential solution to improved delivery of expected outcomes. It refers to the combinations of skills among employees that are available at a given specific time (Adams, 1994).",
    "In the recent past, skills mix within health research institutions has become increasingly important due to the necessary requirement of conducting multidisciplinary research. The term skill is commonly used interchangeably with the term expertise. However expertise has been referred to as the mechanism underlying the superior Tanzania Journal of Health Research Volume 13 (Suppl 1), December 2011 DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/thrb.v13i1.11 achievement of an expert (Ericsson et al., 1993). The Webster's dictionary defines an expert as \"one who has acquired special skill in or knowledge of a particular subject(s) through professional training and practical experience (Merriam Webster, 2009). It is a term therefore used to describe highly experienced professionals, but has been extended to include individuals who attained their superior performance by instruction and extended practice. The current skills mix among NIMR research scientists has always been a heritage of the old East African Medical Council research institutions whose premises it inherited in 1979 to establish NIMR Research Centres.",
    "The centres were disease oriented with Mwanza Centre focusing on schistosomiasis and intestinal helminths, Amani Centre on malaria and other vector-borne diseases, Muhimbili Centre on Tuberculosis, Tukuyu on onchocerciasis and Tabora Centre on sleeping sickness. Right from establishment, NIMR's focus has been on research towards communicable diseases. However, over the years, the epidemiology of non-communicable diseases is changing rapidly in the country, bringing the diseases towards the level of public health importance (Mfinanga et al., 2011).",
    "NIMR is yet to develop expertise in these areas. Despite communicable diseases still being more important there is a danger of the two types of diseases to overlap at some point, leading towards aggravating the disease burden to the Tanzanian community. There is need for NIMR to develop such capacities particularly in cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, mental health, substance abuse, neurological disorders, geriatric disorders, nutrition disorders and diagnostics.",
    "One other area that requires immediate attention is research on maternal and child health. This is still a very weak area in NIMR though it overarches two millennium development goals, namely MDG 4 (Reducing Child Mortality) and MDG 5 (Improving Maternal Health) (United Nations, 2008). If attention and development of research capacity in these areas is not urgently considered, NIMR will lag behind in its contribution towards achieving the MDGs, which will turn out to be a miss-service to the Tanzanian community.",
    "Expertise in data handling and management is still wanting within NIMR, with the exception of Mwanza Centre which has a well developed data management system to support research. Discussion with Centre Directors revealed that this is still an area of concern where more effort ought to be directed.",
    "The institute has very few (8) biostatisticians and virtually no data managers to support them. Infrastructure for data handling and management is still very poor. There is a great need to develop such capacities.",
    "One aspect that appears limiting is the number and quality of laboratory technologists in NIMR employment. This is a cadre that ought to work closely and in support of research scientists in their day to day work. Ideally, in a vibrant research environment there should have been more technologists than research scientists. At least each research scientist should be having more than one ongoing research activity, each of which would thus require a technologist to run. The current situation implies that there is either a large number of research scientists that sits idle, or some scientists simply assumes the role of technologist or else, more junior staff such as untrained laboratory assistants are the ones taking up roles of laboratory technologists potentially resulting into poor quality results. This imbalance ought to be corrected.",
    "Other requisite cross-cutting skills that appear important for NIMR to address its mandate fully but are still inadequate include monitoring and evaluation, research ethics, research management and coordination. Important as these skills are, there is only one person trained in medical ethics, one in M&E and none in research project management. The institute lacks staff dedicated to managing intellectual property rights emanating from institutional research findings.",
    "Tanzania Journal of Health Research Volume 13 (Suppl 1), December 2011 DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/thrb.v13i1.11 Health research is intended to solve practical problems prevailing in the country. It therefore becomes imperative that an assessment is done to understand the prevailing landscape and priorities made.",
    "Focussing on priority research areas leads to rational use of resources and immediate impact on health particularly in conformity with achieving the millennium development goals. NIMR health research priorities are structurally guided by the Act of Parliament establishing the National Institute for Medical Research (URT, 1979) which stipulates the mandate entrusted to the institute in the country's health research portfolio. The first country's health research priority setting exercise was conducted in 1992 through a participatory process detailed by Montorzi et al (2009).",
    "Tanzania has probably the most elaborate mechanism in setting the national health agenda in Africa. The national agenda provides a firm platform for NIMR to then set its research priorities.",
    "The strategic plan provides a set of priorities over a number of years (currently five years) that are subject for revision after every two years. However, this study has observed weaknesses in funding, executing and reviewing of the strategy leading to the institution not being able to achieve the desired level of achievement with each strategy. Despite having national health research priorities in place since 1992, NIMR did not have its own institutional priorities until 1997 when it crafted its' very first strategic plan (NIMR, 1997).",
    "Since then, two more strategic plans have been crafted (NIMR 2002; NIMR 2008a). Interview responses from Centre Directors indicated that there was poor strategy implementation due to lack of funding to support the plan. Unfortunately, there was no thorough documented review or evaluation of the strategic plans so far.",
    "The current plan, in addition to conducting research in priority areas as guided by the national health research priorities, it also aims at (i) strengthening the system of protection of intellectual property rights and ownership of research findings; (ii) (ii) improving commercialisation of research products. translation, dissemination and utilisation of findings; and research As it is now, NIMR research activities are prone to being steered away from national priorities depending on the interests of the funding bodies. It is just by coincidence that the interests of the funders may corroborate those on the institutes' priority list.",
    "The NIMR often finds itself in a compromising situation to accept conducting research even if they do not exactly conform to national priorities (Uthman, 2009). This situation therefore calls for more national funding for health research in order to be able address those priority areas of interest and hence realise the most benefit to the nation.",
    "During the past 30 years, NIMR appears to have managed to exercise fully all the mandate given to her except for a few areas that are yet to be fully addressed. These include articles 4.(1) d: \"to monitor, control and co-ordinate medical research carried out within Tanzania, or elsewhere on behalf of or for the benefit of the government of Tanzania, and to evaluate the findings of that research\" and 4.(1) e: \"to establish a system for the registration of and to register the findings of medical research carried out within Tanzania, and promote the practical application of those findings for the purposes of improving or advancing the health and general welfare of the people of Tanzania\". These are key areas that govern the process of turning research findings into practice, be it policy, product, intervention etc.",
    "There are currently no strong structures in place to support these activities, including personnel with the requisite skills to perform the duties associated with such mandate (Mboera et al., 2009). The monitoring and evaluation system is almost non-existent and the registration system of research findings is not functional.",
    "Being a public research institution, NIMR receives its core funding from the government of the United Republic of Tanzania. The health sector in Tanzania is considered a key factor in economic development and is accorded higher status through Cluster II of the National Strategy for Growth and Poverty Reduction (NSGPR) (Government of Tanzania, 2005).",
    "It is on record that from 1991 to 2000, the government of Tanzania provided US$ 29.5 million as core funding to national health research institutions (Kitua et al. 2002). This scenario has been observed despite the bold and clear statement from the President of the United Republic of Tanzania in 2008 that Tanzania Journal of Health Research Volume 13 (Suppl 1), December 2011 DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/thrb.v13i1.11 the government was committed to increase state funding for research and development from 0.3% of the gross domestic product (GDP) to 1%. Financially speaking, this increase of GDP is equivalent to TShs 248 billion up from the current annual funding of TShs 75 billion (Shoo, 2009).",
    "We remain optimistic that the situation will change once the plan is implemented and that NIMR will see an increase in research funding from the government. This study has observed that recruitment of research scientists at NIMR during the first two decades was very stringent such that it resulted in bringing on board a team of very competitive scientists, despite the small labour market prevailing at that time. Realizing that research scientists are not readily available on the job market, NIMR has always strived and succeeded in readily training its scientists with the aim of having all of them acquire at least a research doctorate degree.",
    "Support from government has not come by over the years and training remained to be funded entirely from foreign sources. This has made it difficult to observe and adhere to the institutional training programme.",
    "Training has become a motivator to most staff and a tool for staff retention. Efforts to put in place a staff motivation and retention scheme was immediately frustrated by lack of resources.",
    "Rewards in form of compensation to research scientists have recently improved through a national programme to promote scientific research. Over the years, NIMR has been able to develop a number of partnerships, albeit with its traditional research partners from Europe. This study has observed an increased number of partnerships and networks beginning in the late 1990s. These partnerships have been very rewarding in terms of winning large grants, accessing training opportunities, building research infrastructure, accessing mentorship for budding Tanzanian scientists as well as building high profile for the institute.",
    "The national policy framework does not seem to be consistent in terms of promoting and supporting health research capacity building. Whereas Vision 2025, National Science & Technology Policy and NSGPR (Government of Tanzania, 2005) seriously addresses scientific research, the Health Sector Strategic Plan III is silent on health research (MoHSW, 2009).",
    "Such inconsistencies in policy frameworks are likely to introduce systemic bottlenecks that could potentially retard research and development processes. It is important that such policy frameworks are revisited and harmonized accordingly.",
    "At inception, NIMR inherited poor research infrastructure that was very rudimentary, made of very basic laboratories at the former East African Community research institutions. Immediate efforts were made to develop research infrastructure with the WHO/TDR research strengthening grant.",
    "Further development in this area has resulted to NIMR having modern research laboratory facilities at most of its research centres (Mboera, 2010). New technologies to support research, such as internet connectivity is now available at all research centres and all active research stations.",
    "Due to the pace of developing technologies, these will need regular updating and should be considered as a continuous process. The current findings show that research performed by NIMR still covers a narrow range of disciplines, with emphasis on parasitic and communicable diseases. Indeed this is due to the diseases inflicting a huge burden on the Tanzanian community. The study has observed the need to focus on cross-cutting and supportive disciplines such as health systems, bioinformatics and data management. With the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases, it is also In order to make significant important that more research is directed towards the area.",
    "contributions to the Millennium Development Goals, NIMR ought to urgently develop a research agenda on maternal and child health that directly addresses MDG4 and MDG 5. Such a move is considered more rewarding at the moment since resources are readily available.",
    "Subsequently, other areas such as non-communicable diseases are also considered important. The National Institute for Medical Research is a public institution that acts as a health research arm of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare.",
    "It therefore receives its core funding from the treasury of the government of the United Republic of Tanzania. The current study has found that the funding received from the government covers most of the running of the institute Tanzania Journal of Health Research Volume 13 (Suppl 1), December 2011 DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/thrb.v13i1.11 with a very small proportion going towards direct funding for research.",
    "Over a ten years period from 2000/01 to 2009/10, the mean proportion of this allocation has remained below 5%. The last few years from 2006/07 to 2009/10 have witnessed no funding being allocated to NIMR for research.",
    "Training of research scientists, which is considered an important component for capacity building has not received any financial support from the national government. It has therefore entirely depended on foreign funding. Likewise, infrastructure development in terms of putting up and equipping laboratories has largely depended on external funding.",
    "There is an urgent need to increase local funding for capacity building and research. The level of government funding observed in the last three years has been discouraging. It is extremely important that the situation is reversed if sustainable health research capacity building is to be achieved in the country.",
    "Despite the efforts to collaboratively set priorities, research institutions in Tanzania do not receive adequate core funding from the government that would allow them to do long-term planning, establish and comply with national research priorities, and invest in creating strong research programmes. Similar to our findings, funds allocated for research in Tanzania was reported to be far below the recommended 2% of the national budgets (Kitua, 2007). Although international donors give support to research, but usually for one-off projects, which they often design and lead. With inadequate local funding of research in Tanzania, international donors are a key source of funding for local researches; and therefore it is not surprising that the same donor agency influence policy making to a large extent (Mboera et al., 2009).",
    "Apart from carrying out health research, NIMR is also mandated to monitor and evaluate health research conducted in Tanzania or on behalf of Tanzania. This study found that NIMR has not been able to develop the requisite institutional capacity to carry out the mandate.",
    "NIMR should consider capacity building as a continuous process and not a one-off event. A programme should be put in place to ensure sustainability of the capacity building process.",
    "Certainly, qualified research scientists are not readily available on the job market, they have to be developed and sustained by having in place research facilities such as laboratories, equipment and research funding. Having trained such staff, they become precious resources that ought to be retained through some elaborate affirmative action. With the broad mandate that has been vested in NIMR, it is high time that capacity in M&E and research management particularly that of intellectual property rights are prioritized and developed in order to maximize the benefits of research. The main limitations of the current study are as a result of the experienced difficulty in obtaining comprehensive systematic data on both personnel and financial information, particularly on research funding, patents, consultancies, individual and institutional capacity building activities.",

The aim of the work was to see what the views and experiences of researchers who received funding were, and what might be learned for the future of the scheme.",
    "Twenty five reports were analysed. Four main themes were identified, these described: the added value of public involvement; aspects to consider when planning and designing public involvement; different roles of public contributors; and aspects of valuing public member contributions. The group approach to analysis was successful in enabling involvement of a variety of individuals in the process.",
    "The findings of the study provide evidence of the value of public involvement during the development of applications for research funding. The results also indicate that researchers recognise the variety in potential roles for the public in research, and acknowledge how involvement adds value to studies.",

    "Research Involvement and Engagement (2016) 2:13 Page 2 of 15 (Continued from previous page) Abstract Background A regional Research Design Service, funded by the National Institute for Health Research, introduced a small grant in 2008, to support public involvement (often known as patient and public involvement [PPI]) activities during the development of applications for research funding. Successful applicants are requested to submit a report detailing how the grant money was used, including a description of the aims and outcomes of the public involvement activities.",
    "The purpose of this study was to analyse the content of these reports. We aimed to find out what researcher views and experiences of public involvement activities were, and what lessons might be learned.",
    "Methods We used an innovative method of data analysis, drawing on group participatory approaches, qualitative content analysis, and Framework Analysis to sort and label the content of the reports. We developed a framework of categories and sub-categories (or themes and sub-themes) from this process. Results Twenty five documents were analysed.",
    "Four main themes were identified in the data: the added value of public involvement; planning and designing involvement; the role of public members; and valuing public member contributions. Within these themes, sub-themes related to the timing of involvement (prior to the research study/ intended during the research study), and also specific benefits of public involvement such as: validating ideas; ensuring appropriate outcomes; ensuring the acceptability of data collection methods/tools and advice regarding research processes. Other sub- themes related to: finding and approaching public members; timing of events; training/ support; the format of sessions; setting up public involvement panels: use of public contributors in analysis and interpretation of data; and using public members to assist with dissemination and translation into practice. Conclusions The analysis of reports submitted by researchers following involvement events provides evidence of the value of public involvement during the development of applications for research funding, and details a method for involving members of the public in data analysis which could be of value to other researchers The findings of the analysis indicate recognition amongst researchers of the variety in potential roles for public members in research, and also an acknowledgement of how involvement adds value to studies.",
    "Keywords: Patient and public involvement, Public involvement, Lay representation, Consumer involvement, Qualitative, Document analysis, Research design, Patient and public engagement, Participatory research Background Public involvement (often known as patient and public involvement [PPI]) has been increasingly advocated as an essential element of high quality and clinically relevant research [1]. By involvement in this context we are referring to patients, carers and/or members of the public actively contributing to the design, delivery, management and/ or dissemination of research. However, there is limited evidence available regarding the processes and impact of public involvement in research [2].",
    "A review in 2009 [3] reported that public involvement may increase study recruitment, improve trial design and outcome measures, and benefit the people involved. A review of published exam- ples of involvement in research design [4] found that members of the public were reported to contribute to research design by: reviewing patient information sheets/ Baxter et al. Research Involvement and Engagement (2016) 2:13 Page 3 of 15 consent procedures; suggesting outcome measures; reviewing data collection proce- dures; and recommending timing of recruitment and follow up.",
    "Researchers who apply for funding to carry out studies are commonly expected to demonstrate how they have involved lay individuals in preparing their applications, to outline what changes were made to the application as a result of public involvement, and to outline in detail how they will involve members of the public in the design and conduct of the research if funded [2]. The involvement of the public at an early stage in developing proposals can present a challenge to potential applicants as, without the funding being in place, there is no identified resource to draw upon to support involve- ment activities.",
    "Guidelines from the advisory body INVOLVE emphasise that the time, skills and expertise of members of the public should be recognised, and that accurate budgeting for costs is essential [5]. Costs may relate for example to reviewing a research proposal, attending a meeting, preparing for a meeting, or reading relevant documents.",
    "The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) created 10 regional Research Design Services (RDSs) to provide design and methodological support to health and social care researchers across England, when developing grant applications to the NIHR and other national peer-reviewed funding programmes [6]. The service provides advice and expertise, and builds \"bridges and connections across research groups\" [7] to enable high quality research proposals.",
    "As part of their role, the RDSs provide advice to researchers on public involvement at all stages of the research study. Many of the RDSs have also developed schemes whereby they offer funding to support service user involve- ment at the research design stage",
    "[8, 9]. The NIHR RDS for Yorkshire and Humber has an established Public Involvement funding scheme to assist researchers to gain involvement with the public during the de- velopment of research grant applications. Four calls are held each year, and the amount requested can be up to PS500.",
    "Following receipt of an award, researchers are asked to write a short report outlining how the payment was used, and the extent and ways in which the public contributed to the development of the application. Researchers are pro- vided with guidelines for the structure of the report (see Appendix).",
    "Papers describing schemes in other RDS regions [2, 8] have provided evidence of a link between public involvement and successful funding outcomes. A previous paper which examined the Yorkshire and Humber scheme [9] provided details of the usage of the scheme, described the characteristics of applications and out- comes, and outlined three case examples of how the award contributed to successful grant applications.",
    "The purpose of the current study was to examine in detail the reports that are completed by researchers following public involvement activities. In this study we aimed to analyse reported views and experiences regarding the processes of public involvement, in order to investigate elements that might be barriers or facilitators to public involvement in research proposals. Methods We intended that the analysis process should fully include public involvement, and therefore adopted a group participatory approach to analysis of the reports on public involvement events, as outlined below.",
    "Baxter et al. Research Involvement and Engagement (2016) 2:13 Page 4 of 15 Approach to analysis The approach to analysis drew on techniques of qualitative content analysis and Framework Analysis.",
    "These techniques aim to derive meaning from text, by systematic classification and coding, to identify recurring patterns or themes [10]. Content analysis can be used to describe a range of analysis techniques, including a simple counting of sections of text that contains similar words or phrases [10].",
    "Qualitative content analysis aims to go beyond counting words, to examine the language for meaning. In addition to qualitative content analysis, we drew on techniques of Framework Analysis [11] to ensure that the process of analysis was systematic and comprehensive. In this approach the data are organised into a chart of columns and rows (with each row being an individual document, and each column a theme) to assist with the identification and labelling of text into meaningful chunks.",
    "Method of analysis A workshop was arranged for the purpose of analysing the reports. Four members of the public with experience of being involved in research, and five local public involvement advisers and facilitators were invited to attend.",
    "Prior to the workshop the first author (SB) sourced and read all the reports that were available. As the length of the reports ran to many pages and included information relating to back- ground literature and financial information, an initial extraction was carried out to copy sections of the reports that were relevant to a new document to reduce the burden on public members. There remained a large quantity of text following this process, and in order to share out the workload, six individual documents with different sets of data were created.",
    "SB broadly grouped the content of the reports into: input to the research topic; input to the proposed research methods; potential roles of public contributors in the planned study; benefits of public involvement; methods to recruit public contributors; and barriers and facilitators to public involvement. Each report was sent to a pair of workshop participants (one member of the public and one public involvement staff lead) two weeks before the event, with a request to read the text and note down anything that was interesting or important. Ten participants attended the workshop.",
    "The session began with a brief introduction and warm up categorisation activity (on the topic of food and drink) to give partici- pants practice and confidence in grouping written text together to develop themes and sub-themes. Following this, the group divided into the pairs who had received the same text.",
    "They discussed the data and wrote down themes that they had identified on sticky notes. Key themes across all the reports were discussed as a whole group and recorded on flip chart sheets. In an interactive process of framework development participants discussed and stuck their notes on the flip chart sheets, with sub-categories/themes developed by grouping sticky notes together. Two weeks following the workshop the completed framework of themes and sub- themes was circulated via email to attendees asking for feedback on the categories, any themes that were unclear, or did not appear to be representative of the data that they had scrutinised. SB then re-read the data from the reports to populate the framework with text, and this was re-circulated for input from the group to develop the final analysis.",
    "Baxter et al. Research Involvement and Engagement (2016)",
    "2:13 Page 5 of 15 Results We analysed data from 25 reports written by researchers following public involve- ment activities. The length of the documents varied from four pages to more than 20 pages, with varying level of detail.",
    "The outline framework of themes and sub- themes that was developed from analysing these reports is presented in Table 1. As can be seen, there were four key themes identified relating to: the added value intended roles of public of public involvement; planning/designing involvement; members; and valuing the contributions of public members.",
    "The sub-themes were commonly grouped by the phase in the research process: either prior to the study commencing; during the study; or after the study. Each of the themes will be briefly described with illustrative quotations from the reports provided. Added value of public involvement In the reports researchers described how involvement activities had been valuable prior to the study commencing.",
    "The added value had been in terms of validating or adding to their knowledge and perceptions of the intended research subject area: \"They felt that research attempting to understand what people can do to maintain wellbeing would be very beneficial to patients\". \"Comments were made that it [the research topic] resonated very strongly with their own experiences\".",
    "There were examples of how public involvement had directly influenced the particular area of the research proposal: \"It prompted us to think we should focus, in our proposal, only on improving post-diagnostic support, since this was a more discrete issue\". Public involvement was also reported to have been valuable in developing the specifics of an intervention that was going to be tested. Researchers had received valuable feedback in regard to: who should deliver a programme; the content of an intervention; and the acceptability of a programme to patients: \"Based on these suggestions, I decided the next step will be to modify these relaxation methods\" (the content of the relaxation tape provided to participants was changed).",
    "\"The intervention would be acceptable to patients\". Public contributors had also provided valuable advice in regard to ensuring that outcomes of interventions were of importance to patients: As a consequence, we have included this as a secondary outcome in the plan of care that all patients recruited into the study would receive\" (an additional wellbeing outcome was included). Baxter et al.",
    "Research Involvement and Engagement (2016) 2:13 Page 6 of 15 Table 1 Framework of themes developed from the data Added value of public involvement Prior to study commencing Validating ideas Input in regard to appropriate terminology Developing interventions Ensuring clarity/user friendliness of written information Ensuring appropriate outcomes Acceptability of data collection methods/tools Alerting to potential ethical/patient safety issues Advice regarding research processes such as recruitment/drop out/follow up During study Ensuring research conducted with sensitivity/empathy Sharing experiences/emphasising value of individual experiences in study Planning/designing public involvement Prior to study commencing Recruitment to public involvement event During study Timing Venue Training/support Payment Format of sessions Facilitation skills Training/support Recruitment to study advisory groups Payment Contacting members Commitment/burden Role of public members After study Feedback to members on outcome/findings Prior to study commencing Proposal development Co-applicant Feedback on accessibility of language Intended during study Advice Public panel Project steering group/management panel Scrutinise conduct of research As patient interviewers Involvement in analysis and interpretation Review of documentation to be used Assist with ethical approval documentation Consult regarding any issues regarding recruitment/involvement Help with any developing or evolving issues Intended after study Assist with dissemination Assisting with writing up findings Assist with translation into practice Baxter et al.",
    "Research Involvement and Engagement (2016) 2:13 Page 7 of 15 Table 1 Framework of themes developed from the data (Continued) Valuing public member contributions Recognising expertise of members Feeding back Value for public members A key area for input was ensuring the appropriateness of terminology, clarity and user friendliness of written information, such as the Lay Summary and the patient information leaflet: \"Participants recommended some word changes and alternative phrasing to ensure it is fully understood by patients\".",
    "\"Other suggestions have been incorporated into a revised version of the Lay Summary\". The methods and tools for collecting outcomes was another area of important contribution. The researchers used the opportunity to try out completion of questionnaires, or asked for views on the acceptability of measures and methods to collect the data: \"From talking to attendees I understood how people had very different views on using outcome measures...therefore in the research proposal I have developed flexibility in the process of testing using outcome measures\".",
    "\"All patients were willing to undergo the extra tests\". During these discussions some researchers reported that potential ethical or patient safety issues were raised, such as how abnormal test results should be communicated. Advice had been received regarding research processes such as methods for recruitment, measures that could be taken to minimise drop out, and the length of time that patients should be followed up: \"As a direct result of discussions the focus of recruitment was altered, this had a sizeable impact on the design of the trial and altered the aims and objectives of the project\".",
    "\"There was a strong preference for recruitment to be initiated via a face-to-face approach in clinic because this would allow patients to ask questions about the study straight away\". \"All parents agreed that ideally the study follow up period should be at least 12 months because of changes over a 6-12 month period in a child's life that can influence the sleep pattern\".",
    "\"All agreed they would rather complete the questionnaires at home\". Baxter et al.",
    "Research Involvement and Engagement (2016) 2:13 Page 8 of 15 Researchers reported that public involvement had highlighted the need to ensure that studies were conducted with sensitivity and empathy. Involvement activities had also emphasised the importance of capturing varying individual experiences of healthcare in order to inform the study design. As these reports were written prior to research studies commencing, this explains the lack of data reporting researcher perceptions of added value after a study.",
    "However, intended roles for public members within studies were described, and these data are outlined within the theme of public member roles below. Planning/designing public involvement The reports provided insight into strategies that are important to consider when planning public involvement. Researchers described methods that they had used to recruit potential attendees to their involvement events/activities. These includedto using key representatives or healthcare professionals approach individuals known to them, attending formal and informal meetings, using online forums, and placing adverts on websites or in NHS departments.",
    "Several of the researchers described challenges to recruitment, with also significant drop out of attendees immediately before the event: from local services \"We had originally planned to involve 6-8 patients in this PPI work. Due to recruitment difficulties we only ended involving four patients. In the future, we will allow more time for recruitment and identify patients from more than one surgeon's clinic\".",
    "\"Some families could not take part in our discussion groups as they were unable to make care arrangements for their other children. In addition, we also received late notice cancellations due to illness and other engagements\". There were recommendations that potential issues of timing and location such as school holidays, travelling distance, and start time should be considered carefully.",
    "Also, that a longer meeting, with time for small group work might be useful: \"Arranging the session in the holiday period probably accounted at least partly for the low attendance\". \"Maybe being longer as I felt there was a great deal more we could have discussed\".",
    "Elements which contributed to successful meetings were: sending hand-outs to participants beforehand; having an agenda; ensuring that translators were available if required; having a relaxed atmosphere where all could contribute; and considering whether several smaller groups might be preferable to one larger event: \"People would have liked to have seen the hand-outs before the meeting\". \"A member of staff or the researcher translated the meeting content for those participants and service users that did not speak English\".",
    "Baxter et al. Research Involvement and Engagement (2016) 2:13 Page 9 of 15 \"They were encouraged to contribute to discussion, and during the meeting their views were valued\". \"Two separate PPI meetings were convened to minimise the anxiety and stress\".",
    "The importance of having well-developed facilitation skills was mentioned,in order to ensure that all participants had a chance to contribute, and to create an atmosphere that was enjoyable and interesting. An event prior to submission of the research proposal was described as a useful avenue for finding members for advisory groups during the study.",
    "The need to consider training and support for public contributors during the study was also highlighted, together with the importance of planning how any payment for time and expenses would be provided: \"A range of training would be needed including interpersonal skills and self-confidence in addition to training on research processes and skills\". \"Payment for time and out of pocket expenses will be provided\". \"Participants expressed suspicion of the idea of payment for participation\" (involvement in advisory groups).",
    "Researchers found that email was a popular way of communicating with public contributors, with some also recommending the use of texting to send reminders about meetings. Role of public members A range of planned or intended roles for public contributors was described before, during and after a study. As outlined above in the section on the added value of public involvement, feedback gained at involvement events made significant contributions during development of the research proposal.",
    "\"I used this feedback to improve the application\". \"The research team are confident that the bid has been improved by the rich data collected during this meeting\". Some researchers used a second round of consultation after the event to gain feedback on the changes that they had made: \"A second meeting was held, after a draft grant application and copies of the data collection tools had been circulated, to obtain feedback on specific aspects of the study design and grant application such as the proposed recruitment strategy, the choice of outcomes, and the content of the plain English summary\".",
    "Baxter et al. Research Involvement and Engagement (2016) 2:13 Page 10 of 15 Another potential role for public members prior to a study was as a co-applicant. The possibility of this was mentioned by three researchers, although none of the reports described public members taking on this role.",
    "Intended roles during the study described were: acting as general advisers; becoming a member of a public advisory group/panel; or being a contributor on the project steering group: \"We plan for two patients from the PPI group to attend each trial management group meeting\". \"We also explained our plan for patient involvement activities if the project is funded, and invited the participants to form a patient involvement group that would support the research study\".",
    "Part of the role of these individuals would be to oversee the conduct of the research: \"To scrutinise the conduct of the research, ensure that resources are used appropriately and to monitor progress\". Patient and public involvement was also planned during the study to contribute to analysis and interpretation of the data; to review documentation used during the study and assist with ethical approval documentation; to seek advice regarding recruitment/ involvement; and to help with any developing or evolving issues: \"We intend to involve one or two of the participants from this focus group in the design of the trial; especially in the formulation of information sheets and consent forms\".",
    "\"Having pregnant women on the panel will enable us to discuss and address issues around recruitment and concordance from their perspective. This will enable us to alter or improve recruitment strategies\". After the study it was envisaged that public members would assist with dissemination, with writing up findings, and with translation of the findings into practice: \"The planned events are designed to engage a wide range of stakeholders and will form a key part of our definitive trial proposal development, dissemination, and translation into practice plan\".",
    "The importance of discussing and managing the commitment/burden for members of the public during a study was emphasised. It was suggested that fluid membership might be considered, or several individuals could share the role between them in order to reduce time burden. It was acknowledged that ill health could limit the ability of some individuals to make a time commitment: \"The original PPI group felt it would be acceptable to have a fluid membership of pregnant women in the PPI group\". Baxter et al.",
    "Research Involvement and Engagement (2016) 2:13 Page 11 of 15 \"They agreed that having more than one expert patient on the project group meant individuals could 'share the load' and liked the potential for 'peer support' between expert patients\". Valuing public member contributions The perception of public contributors as being individuals with expertise to share, was a thread throughout the data: \"Interestingly our fears [regarding the potential for distress to participants] were largely unsupported by the expert patients. Instead the expert patients raised other issues they felt to be of greater importance\".",
    "This recognition of expertise and value was illustrated clearly in researcher comments regarding changes that were made following public input. The importance of providing feedback to participants following events was also highlighted: \"I have assured the panel that all comments have been reflected upon and the comments have been included in the submission\". \"A lay summary document was produced which detailed the key messages to be taken from the discussion and how the proposed research will be developed as a result\".",
    "Some of the reports included feedback from participants who had taken part in the involvement events. These data included perceptions that being involved was of value to members of the public themselves, and provided insight into the motivation for them taking part: \"I felt good in the meeting and it gave me a chance to get to know people with these issues; and it gave me an insight into how other people are and I got to talk openly, as well as listening to other people's feedback\".",
    "\"This is certainly helping me anyway, being part of this...knowing that it's not just me in this world that it affects\". \"I hope my input was helpful for all the (those) involved\". Discussion",
    "This analysis of reports written by researchers following public involvement activities in developing applications for research provides evidence regarding the perceived value of involvement during the research design process. The views and experiences of researchers described in this study provide further data to support the value of involve- ment of patients and the public at an early stage in developing proposals. The research findings are also consistent with existing guidance for researchers on public involvement issued by organisations such as INVOLVE [12], and the Research Design Services",
    "[13]. The results of the study provide a useful framework for re- searchers to consider public involvement at all stages when developing proposals, and Baxter et al. Research Involvement and Engagement (2016) 2:13 Page 12 of 15 enable them to draw on the experiences of other researchers. The group method that we used to carry out the data analysis was a useful approach to achieving involvement of individuals who have no previous experience of qualitative data analysis.",
    "The potential for lay individuals to contribute to data analysis is commonly recommended [12-14]. However, we have found few detailed examples of studies reporting methods used to facilitate members of the public contributing to data analysis (a notable exception is described by Gillard et al. 2012 [15]). The Framework Method has been suggested as being appropriate for use in research teams where not all members have previous experience of conducting qualitative research [16], and our experience concurs with this.",
    "Our data related to a discrete topic, which may have made the process of analysis more straightforward. Other researchers have cau- tioned that the Framework Method deals less well with highly heterogeneous data [16]. A short debrief was held at the end of the analysis workshop, where participants were encouraged to reflect on the participatory process used.",
    "All participants valued the warm up exercise where they were asked to categorise different types of food as this demon- strated the categorisation process in an accessible way and helped to build confidence. Group members reported that working in pairs to look at specific sections of data worked well. Pairs reported that each person brought slightly different insights and perspectives to the data.",
    "Breaking the data into manageable sections was also appreciated, as this made both the workshop tasks and the preparatory work more manageable. Having one person who had read all the reports in full provided valuable oversight, and meant that individual sections could be put into context if needed.",
    "One potential negative aspect of splitting the text into sections before the workshop, is that the data had already been filtered by a researcher, which could impact on people's interpretations. Feedback from participants following the work- shop was that reading larger sections of data would have been overly onerous, and that different interpretations of data were still possible from reading and discussing each other's sections.",
    "Everyone present had some previous experience of public involvement. This was posi- tive in that it allowed the group to easily understand the topic and the aims of the project. However, this also created a challenge in that people moved easily into discussing their own experiences, and at times made some assumptions about the activities being described in the reports.",
    "Workshop participants had to challenge each other regarding this, and bring discussions back to the data. The group had worked together in the past, and therefore felt able to challenge each other when needed. Group members reported that this would be more difficult with a group who did not have a prior relationship. A learning point here, is that a certain amount of preparation and relationship building is necessary within a workshop where people are coming from different backgrounds, and where challenging each other's perceptions is central to the process.",
    "Limitations We recognise a limitation of the study is that the data came from researchers who had applied for, and achieved funding for public involvement activities. Their views and perceptions may therefore be more positive than researchers who have not recognised the potential benefits, or have not considered public involvement. The researchers were Baxter et al.",
    "Research Involvement and Engagement (2016) 2:13 Page 13 of 15 also responding to their funder, and may therefore be more inclined to be positive. The data were also analysed by a group of people who already had public involvement experience, and pre-existing views and experiences may have influenced their interpret- ation of the data.",
    "It is also important to note that while the reports provide evidence regarding how involvement activities had contributed to development of the research proposal, the potential expected impact on the study itself (if it was successful in receiving funding) was based on researcher intentions rather than actual experience. Future work This work provides evidence of the value of public involvement in the development of proposals however, the impact during studies themselves requires further investigation. It would be helpful for example to gain a further understanding regarding how PPI elements of proposals have informed funding decisions, and how the intentions for PPI of researchers prior to a study, related to the actual involvement achieved.",
    "Research examining the implementation of plans for PPI in clinical trials [17] reported that while most of the plans for PPI had been implemented, some researchers spoke of using it as a means of \"ticking the right boxes\" during the application process. This study also found considerable variability regarding the extensiveness of planned PPI activity, and varying clarity with which plans were described.",
    "This lack of consistency regarding the quality and implementation of PPI in studies which have been accepted for funding, suggests that further investigation of PPI elements throughout the entire course of a research project would be valuable. A recently completed study",
    "[18] has provided evidence that PPI during studies can have positive outcomes in the form of changes to study design, and improvements to recruitment and dissemination when enabling contexts are present. As the authors of this study suggest, it would be interesting to track PPI involvement not only through the course of a project, but also from the earliest stage of research proposals to longer term impact on practice.",
    "Following examination of reports the RDS has continued its consideration regarding ongoing delivery of the funding scheme, and its evaluation [9]. There are plans to follow up a sample of the award recipients including members of the public who had been actively involved in the research, to explore what happened later in the process, and whether the planned public involvement happened when studies commenced. We are also considering ways to seek views on the involvement activities from funders.",
    "The findings of our study indicate that, while public involvement is highly valued, there may be a need for greater support regarding carrying out involvement activities, and the best methods for accessing potential lay members. Some researchers described the need for skills in facilitation, as the public involvement process was very different to their routine clinical interactions, for example one researcher noted \"I need to improve my facilitation skills to learn how to better manage more dominant members of the group.\"",
    "The RDS is considering how best to provide additional advice and support in order that re- searchers have skills to make the most of public involvement opportunities. For example information on how to structure sessions, examples of questions that could be asked, tips on managing group discussions, may assist researchers in preparing for sessions. Baxter et al.",
    "Research Involvement and Engagement (2016) 2:13 Page 14 of 15 Conclusions The findings of the study provide evidence of the value of public involvement during the development of applications for research funding. The results also indi- cate recognition amongst researchers of the variety in potential roles for the public in research, and the acknowledgement of how involvement adds value to studies.

Applying an implementation science lens to policy evaluation suggests that policy impacts are variable depending upon key implementation outcomes (feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness costs) and conditions and contexts. Experiences with non-pharmaceutical interventions COVID-19 case study: (NPIs) including masking, testing, and social distancing/business and school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic response highlight the importance of considering public health policy impacts through an implementation science lens of constantly evolving contexts, conditions, evidence, and public perceptions. As implementation outcomes (feasibility, acceptability) changed, the effectiveness of these interventions changed thereby altering public health policy impact. Sustainment of behavioral change may be a key factor determining the duration of effectiveness and ultimate impact of pandemic policy recommendations, particularly for interventions that require ongoing compliance at the level of the individual.",
    "Practical framework for assessing and evaluating pandemic policy: Updating public health policy recommendations as more data and alternative interventions become available is the evidence-based policy approach and grounded in principles of implementation science and dynamic sustainability. Achieving the ideal of real-time policy updates requires improvements in public health data collection and analysis infrastructure and a shift in public health messaging to incorporate uncertainty and the necessity of ongoing changes. In this review, the Dynamic Infectious Diseases Public Health Response Framework is presented as a model with a practical tool for iteratively incorporating implementation outcomes into public health policy design with the aim of sustaining benefits and identifying when policies are no longer functioning as intended and need to be adapted or de-implemented. Conclusions and implications: Real-time decision making requires sensitivity to conditions on the ground and adaptation of interventions at all levels.",
    "When asking about the public health effectiveness and impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions, the focus should be on when, how, and for how long they can achieve public health impact. In the future, rather than focusing on models of public health intervention effectiveness that assume static impacts, policy impacts Frontiers in Public Health frontiersin.org Branch-Elliman et al. 10.3389/fpubh.2023.1207679 should be considered as dynamic with ongoing re-evaluation as conditions change to meet the ongoing needs of the ultimate end-user of the intervention: the public. KEYWORDS pandemic response, public policy, interventions, dynamic sustainability framework, infectious diseases, COVID-19 implementation science, non-pharmaceutical Background The discovery and subsequent administration of penicillin in 1943 was a major milestone in clinical medicine, saving countless lives (1).",
    "However, even before the drug was approved for clinical use, the first reports of antimicrobial resistance were described. Less than 20 years after initial approval, more than 80% of Staphylococcus aureus strains were penicillin-resistant (2). In the decades since, a similar story has been described for every antibiotic brought to market. Host-pathogen relationships are inherently dynamic: as hosts develop ways to combat an infectious diseases threat-- whether through immunity or treatment--pathogens evolve to evade our advancements.",
    "In addition to an inherently evolving host-pathogen interaction, many factors impacting this interaction are also constantly changing and need to be considered, measured, and integrated into public health policy making. Factors that change over time and therefore determine public policy impact include resource availability, case fatality rate, understanding about modesofthe transmission, human behaviors, societal expectations, evidence basis for treatment and prevention and therefore our understanding about the disease, among others.",
    "Maximizing public health policy impact for combating infectious diseases threats necessitates that all of these dynamic factors be measured and evaluated in real-time to continually response plans and achieve maximum public health adapt to elevate benefit. Updating policies and recommendations some interventions and de-escalate others as contextual factors continually evolve is the best evidence-based policy strategy (3, 4). Achieving this ideal requires re-imaging infectious diseases public health policy making as a dynamic and constantly evolving process with the anticipation of change inherently built into health communications and public expectations (5-7). Infrastructure that can support integration of point-of-care data with emerging and evolving evidence and public input to assess ongoing feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, and costs are needed to achieve safe, efficient and higher quality care and policies (8).",
    "Viewing pandemic responses and the expected impacts of public health policy through the lens of implementation science would enhance emergency preparedness for future pandemics and ultimately improve public health policy impact. The objectives of this review are to: (1) discuss the pipeline from clinical effectiveness to implementation outcomes to ultimate public health impact and introduce the concept of dynamic policy effectiveness (9), (2) to present the COVID-19 pandemic and public health policy as a case study for considering the dynamic host, pathogen, contextual, and evidence changes that evolved over the course the world-wide emergency responses, and (3) to proposeof future innovations to support a real-time, learning public health infrastructure that is more adaptable based on changing conditions, context, and evidence.",
    "A practical tool for operationalizing the Dynamic Infectious Diseases Public Health Response Framework is presented. The tool is designed to facilitate integration of key implementation outcomes and considerations into infectious diseases response planning (Supplementary material).",
    "Clinical efficacy and effectiveness vs. public health policy effectiveness and impact Traditional clinical trials evaluate efficacy and effectiveness of an intervention in a controlled setting, whereas implementation trials evaluate how to promote uptake and how to translate potential benefits into tangible improvements (9). Public health policy impact is a downstream consequence of the potential efficacy of the intervention as well as its real-world implementation (Figure 1). The Dynamic Sustainability Framework (DSF) (10) highlights the importance of adapting interventions on individual and systems levels to maintain and maximize longitudinal impacts in the setting of constantly changing evidence and contexts.",
    "DSF principles also apply to public health systems and public health policy impact. Public health policies are typically composed of a bundle of multiple interventions. To achieve sustained public health impact, public health policies and their component interventions (whether targeted at an individual, organization or society) must adjust and adapt to changing contexts and evidence. In other words, public health policies must be viewed as having dynamic public health impacts and dynamic effectiveness; a constant level of public health impact while other changes in the system are occurring cannot be assumed.",
    "Implementation outcomes Efficacy and effectiveness are the traditional measures for evaluating clinical and public health policies and interventions in controlled research studies. These measures focus on the absolute and relative differences in outcomes among exposed and unexposed groups and are generally conceived of as static estimates; in other words, the relative risk reduction associated with receipt of a particular medical intervention is assumed to be constant over time.

Early implementation outcomes (adoption, feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness) have direct impacts on later implementation outcomes, which in turn determine the effectiveness of a public health policy. During a pandemic response, implementation outcomes change, and these changes also alter the expected benefits of public health policy interventions.",

Very-short term viability, and substantial pressure from the community to limit or refuse these types of mitigation interventions.",
    "The perceived fit, relevance, or compatibility of the policy or practice for a given context** Hospital Admission Surveillance Testing Initially, given reports of asymptomatic spread, universal hospital admission screening was considered an appropriate means for limiting risk to patients and staff. Over time, as vaccines became available and downsides of the testing program emerged (e.g., identification of false positives, changing views of the role of asymptomatic spread in driving transmission, concerns about impacts of delayed medical care), the perceived appropriateness of the intervention changed.",
    "Decision to recommend the intervention or public health policy Masking The decision at a local, state, or national level to officially recommend a specific masking policy, such as a recommendation or a requirement to wear masks in all indoor areas. The extent to which a policy or practice can be used within a specific context. Closely related to and overlapping with resource availability, which has been proposed as an implementation outcome in the context of vaccination.",
    "(12) Testing Strategies Early in the pandemic, testing was not feasible due to limited testing resources. Then, as resource limitations decreased, testing of exposed individuals became a more feasible option for limiting time in quarantine. Then, high rates of spread during the omicron wave made contact tracing infeasible. As individual testing became less feasible, alternative surveillance strategies, such as community wastewater testing, became more widely available and thus a feasible alternative.",
    "The degree to which a policy or practice is implemented as planned. For multifaceted interventions, can be considered as the \"dose.\"",
    "Masking Masking policy recommendations do not necessarily translate into adherence. Fidelity refers to the rate of adherence, which changed longitudinally with availability of other mitigation measures, and changes to acceptability and appropriateness over time. The reach of the policy or practice (e.g., how many people received the intervention/total number of eligible individuals)",
    "School-based testing programs School-based testing programs, such as the test-to-stay modified quarantine program, allowed exposed individuals to continue participation in in-person learning. Penetration, or reach, refers to the number of students and schools who are able to participate in the testing program, and is a function of program availability (access) and participation (e.g, consent)",
    "The cost or impact of the implementation effort (includes intervention costs, costs of implementation, settings) Business and school closures, social distancing The very short-term (i.e., days to weeks) costs and harms of closures are substantial, and increase as duration and extent of closures increases. *Sustainability is not listed, as the focus of the framework is on using different contextual factors to predict sustainability. **Context can be defined broadly, and can refer to practice settings, political settings, longitudinal changers, or other factors that impact the perceived fit of a practice or policy.

    "Early outcomes implementation Implementation science focuses on different outcomes (Table 1) include acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility/availability, and adoption, which is defined as the decision to recommend a specific public health intervention (in contrast with uptake, which is the actual use of the intervention). Later implementation outcomes include fidelity, penetration, and costs. The longest-term implementation outcome is In implementation science, both sustainability and sustainment are key terms, with sustainability referring to a property/characteristic of an intervention related to its likely long-term usability whereas sustainment refers to the outcome of whether an intervention was used over a long period of time. sustainability.",
    "Implementation outcomes: the causal pathway to public health impact Importantly, while often not considered when evaluating clinical efficacy and effectiveness, implementation outcomes directly impact the expected benefit and impact of public health policies and their components (the individual interventions) (Figure 1). Interventions that are promising in laboratory settings or in idealized clinical trial settings have limited or no impact on public and population health if they are infeasible/unavailable, unacceptable, and/or perceived to be inappropriate by end-users. Further complicating longitudinal evaluations of public health impact and ongoing recommendations, these implementation outcomes themselves are not static - feasibility, which is related to availability (12), acceptability, appropriateness, and costs all vary according to contexts, evolving evidence, resource availability, progress, available alternatives and perceived benefits (Figures 2, 3).",
    "Sustainability is a perennial challenge in implementation, particularly if day-to-day behavior change is required and if the intervention is perceived to have substantial downsides. Thus, implementation outcomes are key determinants of public health policy and intervention effectiveness and impact. Implementation outcomes are also constantly evolving. The COVID-19 pandemic public health response: a case study in constant change Consideration of dynamic public health policy effectiveness and impact is particularly important for developing and adapting to infectious disease threats.",
    "As humans make responses advancements, such as the development of therapeutics or vaccines, the pathogen evolves in response to human progress (Figure 4). For example, delta and omicron variants both emerged in part due to pressure from vaccine and infection-induced immunity. Mutations arose that rendered once highly effective monoclonal antibody therapies for early treatment and prophylaxis obsolete.",
    "Antimicrobial resistance, another critical public health threat in infectious diseases, is a direct downstream consequence of pathogen evolution in response to human innovation.the Antimicrobial resistance highlights the generalizability of dynamic nature of the management and containment of infectious diseases beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. The phases of the COVID-19 pandemic the first (early) phase of The COVID-19 pandemic can be viewed as occurring in multiple phases, each characterized by different therapeutic and preventative advancements, resource availability, pathogen infectiousness, evidence and understanding, and varying levels of feasibility, and acceptability of different mitigation policies (Figure 5). Through this lens,the pandemic in the United States lasted from approximately February, 2020 through May of 2020, and was characterized by limited understanding about the novel disease, limited access to testing, and no known effective treatments.",
    "Case fatality rates were high, as were levels of perceived fear and risk, which translated into high levels of perceived appropriateness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). The second (late early) phase lasted from approximately May of 2020 to June of 2020 and was characterized by the identification and availability of effective inpatient therapeutics (remdesivir and dexamethasone).",
    "During Phase II, case fatality rates were lower but still relatively high compared to later periods, and access to a variety of different mitigation strategies, including testing, increased substantially. The third (middle) phase occurred from November 2020 to November 2021 and was characterized by advancements in preventative therapies, specifically vaccines with durable protection against severe disease. During Phase III, case fatality rate plummeted, fear and perceived threat fell precipitously, and the acceptability and appropriateness of many NPIs dropped substantially.",
    "The fourth (late) phase occurred from December 2021 to December 2022 and was characterized by the expansion of therapeutic options to include outpatient therapies and pre- exposure prophylaxis for those at high risk of disease despite vaccination. These advancements further lowered case fatality rates and perceived fear and therefore appropriateness of various NPIs.",
    "A fifth phase may be defined by the loss of pre-exposure prophylaxis due to pathogen evolution (13, 14). Future phases may be defined by the emergence of new variants, the development of next generation vaccines, new pharmaceuticals, or improvements in pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis options, similar to how pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) altered the course of the HIV epidemic (15).",
    "Changing resources Availability of pandemic mitigation tools varied, impacting the feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of different pandemic policy responses (Table 2). Initially, NPIs, including masking, testing strategies, ventilation interventions, and distancing were the only available tools to mitigate transmission; during the very early phases, testing and personal protective equipment (PPE) were both limited resources in the United States.",
    "Subsequently, advancements in disease management and therapeutics reduced disease severity, and then development and distribution of vaccines further reduced disease severity and increased immunity in Frontiers in Public Health frontiersin.org Branch-Elliman et al. 10.3389/fpubh.2023.1207679 FIGURE 2 Impact of specific public health policy interventions during different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic: changing context and implementation outcomes alter effectiveness.

    "the population. Expanded access to testing and innovations in community-based surveillance methods changed the utility and delivery of this strategy over time (16). In other countries, resource access was available at different times during the pandemic.",
    "For example, in South Korea, an extensive testing program was available very shortly after identification of SARS-CoV-2, and thus the country was able to effectively leverage this strategy for early outbreak control (17-20). Testing in the US was delayed for a variety of reasons, limiting the effectiveness of a test-and-quarantine mitigation strategy.",
    "Access to PPE was also highly variable, impacting the feasibility of this approach, and therefore its potential impact. Implementation outcomes as determinants of NPI impact With the exception of ventilation upgrades, most NPIs inherently require a high level of ongoing individual effort; then the if fidelity (or use as-intended) is not maintained, the intervention wanes. Masks, for example, effectiveness of only have the potential to work if people wear them (and wear them as-intended); potential policy impact is determined by adherence (21).",
    "For these reasons, NPI policy effectiveness at any point in time is necessarily determined by the degree of appropriate use as-intended within the target population or community. Use as-intended, or fidelity, in turn, is determined in part by the feasibility, acceptability, and perceived appropriatenessof the end-user at any given time. These implementation outcomes all change depending upon themselves be assumed to a variety of be static.",
    "the intervention for factors and cannot In the longer-term, policy impacts are also determined by the sustainment of fidelity to the intervention; because NPIs provide only short-term protection, without sustainment, their impact is to delay, rather than to prevent, infection. Fidelity, penetration, costs and sustainability are implementation outcomes that provide a means to evaluate the implementation success treatments, policies and protocols and areof distinct from traditionally measured outcomes, such as clinical or health service outcomes (11).

Multiple findings from different contexts and different places in the pandemic highlight the challenges in long-term sustainment of NPI adherence and therefore the potential impact of maskingthe policies as a pandemic control measure.",
    "For example, Bangladesh cluster randomized controlled trial found that a bundle of implementation strategies effectively increased mask use by 29% (to 42%), and that the increase in mask use was associated with a statistically significant reduction of 10% of symptomatic SARS- CoV-2 cases in villages randomized to receive surgical masks and a non-significant reduction of 5% among villages randomized to receive cloth masks (22). An equally important finding of this large, cluster randomized controlled trial was the lack of sustainment of adherence to mask wearing over a relatively short period of time (22). Despite a nationwide masking mandate during the entire study period, a follow-up evaluation of mask use 8-12 weeks after the active intervention found that ongoing fidelity to mask use in villages randomized to receive the bundle of implementation strategies had fallen substantially. The initial 29% increase had fallen to only 10% relative to control villages.",
    "Other studies in other settings have similarly found challenges with intervention fidelity (23). Even individuals who undergo training to wear masks properly often are unaware of best practices (24).",
    "Thus, the Abaluck study and others highlight two key points about pandemic mitigation policies. First, masking policies have Frontiers in Public Health frontiersin.org Branch-Elliman et al. 10.3389/fpubh.2023.1207679 TABLE 2 Longitudinal changes in person-based testing strategies: how implementation outcomes varied through different pandemic phases.",

Changes in resources, feasibility, perceived acceptability and appropriateness, costs of the intervention and changes in the host-pathogen relationship determined the longtidunal public policy impacts of the same mitigation measure (testing). Categories do not apply to community-based surveillance methodologies, such as wastewater testing.",
    "the potential to be beneficial, but the long-term sustainment of appropriate use or fidelity to the intervention (and therefore its impact on transmission) means that in the real world, the public health policy impact may change substantially as motivations, such as perceived risk and intervention fatigue, change. Recent nation-wide data provides empirical support for the condition- dependent and dynamic impacts of masking policies, highlighting the importance of incorporating implementation science principles as part of ongoing policy re-evaluation (25, 26). The perennial challenge of sustaining fidelity to interventions that require ongoing behavioral changes (and therefore public is also supported by evidence about health policy impact) adherence to other NPI policies.",
    "A cross-sectional survey conducted in the United States about self-reported adoption of social distancing recommendations found a slow but steady decline in a variety of different settings from May to July of 2020; these findings are also corroborated by Google movements data, which demonstrated a slow but steady return to usual activity after the initial disruption (27, 28). Similarly, although school closures temporarily reduced childhood social interactions, over a relatively short time horizon and long before schools re-opened, the number of contacts increased among children, providing at least a partial explanation for the limited real-world effectiveness of this intervention (29-31).",
    "Additional data from the spring of 2020 demonstrate that movement increased most substantially among counties that lifted stay-at-home orders, but that increased community activity was also evident among counties that maintained stay-at-home policies (32). Of note, these data were collected during an early pandemic period before widespread immunity from natural infection and vaccination when therapeutic options were still minimal.",
    "Despite these contextual factors, fidelity to the intervention nonetheless fell, likely driven by changes in risk perception and costs associated with social distancing policies, particularly business and school closures. Six et al. evaluated factors associated with self-reported adoption of government-recommended NPIs at different snap- shots during the first phase of the pandemic in Belgium (33).",
    "The first survey occurred during the country-wide lockdown, when cases, hospitalizations and deaths were all close to the initial peak. The second survey was collected after cases, hospitalizations and deaths had all fallen, and relaxation of mitigation measures had been announced. The third survey occurred when cases, hospitalizations, and deaths were all very low, and all mitigation measures were about to be lifted.",
    "In these different contexts, authors found that factors and perceptions associated with self-reported compliance varied. At all three data points, fear of Frontiers in Public Health frontiersin.org Branch-Elliman et al. 10.3389/fpubh.2023.1207679 COVID-19 severity, perceived rule appropriateness, and observing others respect the rules were positively associated with self- reported fidelity to recommended interventions. Perceptions about individual risk of exposure to COVID-19 were positively associated with increased support in the second and third surveys. Perceived rule effectiveness was positively associated with fidelity to interventions during the second survey, and measures of altruism were positively associated with self-reported fidelity to interventions during the third survey. Notably, authors also found that self-reported fidelity was negatively associated with trust in government.",
    "This finding diverged from a body of prior evidence suggesting that increasing trust in government is associated with increases in uptake of policy recommendations. Although the reasons for this finding about trust in the specific context of the pandemic could not be entirely delineated, authors theorized that those who were the most fearful about COVID-19, and who therefore were strongly supportive of ongoing restrictions, were also those who lost the most faith in the government response when mitigation measures were relaxed. about factors Findings self-reported associated with appropriate use of mitigation measures align with real-world findings about policy impacts and effectiveness.",
    "Drivers of appropriate use, which is essential for policy effectiveness, and therefore public health impact changed over time (Table 3). Early in the pandemic, fear of COVID-19 was a major factor that drove adherence and willingness to support NPIs.",
    "Changing perceptions about disease severity - as treatments and vaccines became available and as estimates of case fatality changed - likely drove behavioral changes which, in turn, impacted policy effectiveness. Thus, Six et al.'s study also highlights the importance of updating policies to align with current contexts and public perceptions; in a system of constant and dynamic change, public health policy impacts cannot be assumed to be static. Processes for identifying key inflection points in public opinion and contextual changes to trigger policy updates are needed to improve public health policy impact.",
    "Dynamic policy impact: implementation outcomes as determinants of real-world effectiveness Stemming from changing contexts, evidence, and perceptions, the effectiveness of community public health measures are dynamic. Acknowledging dynamic impact implies that ongoing adaptation of public health policy recommendations as new data emerge and resource availability changes will lead to optimal evidence-based policy making and suggests a path for improving future public policy responses to infectious diseases threats.",
    "Each of the four phases of the COVID-19 pandemic is characterized by different levels of fear, public perceptions about appropriateness, resource availability, feasibility, and differences in estimates of policy impacts (Table 3, Figure 3). The evidence basis to support NPI measures, and our understanding about how, when, and for how long they are effective also changed over time.",
    "In addition to NPI fatigue, these constantly evolving factors changed mitigation measure effectiveness via several mechanisms.of levels as-intended Feasibility of some interventions, such as testing and contact tracing, was variable. During the early phases of the pandemic in the US, testing was not a viable prevention strategy in community settings due to limited resource availability (34); however, a test- and-quarantine strategy was successfully implemented in other countries (18). As the resource became more widely available in the US, applications of testing interventions as a mitigation measure were expanded.",
    "For example, test-to-stay programs for school settings replaced disruptive at-home quarantines in favor of in-person learning opportunities for asymptomatic students (35). However, after the emergence of the more transmissible omicron variant, contact tracing became infeasible due to the frequency of possible exposures both inside and outside of school settings, and some test-to-stay programs had to be retired or adapted (36).",
    "As noted above, longitudinal reductions in intervention fidelity were found with social distancing measures as early as the first phase of the pandemic. Decreasing fidelity)use should be anticipated and factored into public health policy recommendations.",
    "different measures is also variable and dependent upon key milestones (e.g., vaccine development and distribution to high-risk populations). Widespread availability and access to vaccines decreased case fatality rates and decreased fear of COVID-19. Decreased case fatality and fear then altered the perceived appropriateness of ongoing strict mitigation policies.",
    "Alterations in perceived appropriateness led to changes in NPI uptake, which then decreased potential NPI policy impact. The lower risk of severe and fatal infections conferred by natural and vaccine-induced immunity also caused smaller absolute risk reduction associated with NPIs policies.",
    "Simultaneous with decreasing impact due to fidelity and sustainment challenges, as the duration of some of the interventions increased, most notably school and business closures, their negative impacts became increasingly apparent (37-40). Overtime, these costs altered perceived appropriateness and acceptability of these pandemic mitigation policies.",
    "Thus, multiple changes at multiple levels changed the net public health impact of NPI policies, all in the direction of decreasing potential public health impact. appropriateness Perceived (e.g.,of Owing to a confluence of these different mechanisms, the effectiveness of NPIs is likely reduced every time they are recommended or reintroduced.",
    "Maximal potential impact occurred during the early phases of the pandemic and subsided with each subsequent wave and medical advancement. Empirical evidence from business closures suggests a potent short-term benefit with rapidly decreasing returns and increasing harms, supporting the theoretical view of longitudinal decreasing expected benefit (41).",
    "Sustainment versus sustainability - defining infectious disease policy goals A core concept in implementation science is that improving uptake of an evidence-based intervention, and sustaining that increased use longitudinally, leads to improvements in clinical and public health outcomes. Embedded in this view is the concept that Frontiers in Public Health frontiersin.org Branch-Elliman et al. 10.3389/fpubh.2023.1207679 TABLE 3 Availability of different COVID-19 mitigation measures and their acceptability, feasibility, sustainability, and potential policy adjustments as conditions and contexts changed.

    "A traditional view of sustainability is the \"fidelity approach,\" which Berta et al. define as \"the extent to which an intervention program follows the originally intended implementation plan and faithfully delivers the research-informed components of the intervention (42).\" In the traditional view of sustainability, maintaining compliance with the originally intended evidence-based intervention is critical for achieving public health benefit.",
    "An alternate view, particularly germane to infectious diseases policy response planning, is the \"adaptive approach,\" which highlights the importance of the \"co- evolution of the intervention\" and the context. The \"adaptive approach\" postulates that adapting the intervention (and reducing fidelity to the original program) to better fit the context may in fact enhance outcomes. In the example of COVID-19, Thus, rather than focusing sustainability efforts on maintaining compliance with interventions (such as masking policies), an alternate (\"adaptive approach\") view is that sustainability efforts should focus on prioritizing the shifting use and form of interventions in order to maintain (or improve) public health outcomes.",
    "this translates to sustained use of interventions that prevent severe disease, long- term disability, and death, rather than focusing on sustained use of any specific intervention. Early in the pandemic, when medical countermeasures were unavailable, SARS-CoV-2 cases were highly correlated with severe disease and death. Thus, strategies that prevented cases led to reductions in mortality.",
    "However, after the availability of medical countermeasures, infections and severe outcomes became uncoupled (43-45). After this uncoupling, preventing cases had a substantially lower public health impact.",
    "Focusing on sustaining specific interventions, such as masking therefore had a progressively decreasing impact on policies, population health outcomes. Focusing public health policy on sustaining and improving outcomes is expected to have ongoing population health benefits.",
    "Notably, viewed through this lens and the \"adaptive approach,\" de-implementation is an inherent aspect of dynamic sustainability for infectious diseases threats, as interventions that are no longer effective should no longer be recommended or enforced. Maximizing public health policy impact: toward a dynamic infectious diseases public health response framework COVID-19 is presented as a case study for considering public health policy impacts and adaption through an implementation science lens. Principles about dynamic change are inherent to the host-pathogen interaction and generalizable beyond the specifics of the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
    "Key lessons learned include the changing public health policy effectiveness of interventions as a function of conditions, contexts, and political environments and the need to consider the aims of sustainability. Rather than focusing on maintaining compliance with any specific intervention, to improve health, public health policy goals should aim to reduce severe health outcomes. Achieving the ideal of adapting policy to sustain benefit will require re-focusing public health surveillance and evaluation methods to include consideration of implementation outcomes and changing contextual factors. Ideally, systems will be developed so that key inflection points, or phase transitions (e.g., from the early phases characterized by fear and limited resources to the Frontiers in Public Health frontiersin.org Branch-Elliman et al. 10.3389/fpubh.2023.1207679 later phases characterized by reduced mortality) can be measured and acted upon in real time through ongoing policy updates.",
    "Empirical evidence for the importance of novel data sources and integrating implementation outcomes into infectious diseases pandemic planning is illustrated in the modeling data from Chang et al., which demonstrated that integration of cell phone movement data improved outbreak prediction model accuracy (46). Authors also found that integration of data about compliance with social distancing policy (fidelity to the public health intervention), which varied with time, improvements in model prediction accuracy. This study therefore highlights the importance of integrating data about key implementation outcomes, such as fidelity, to improve infectious diseases management and public health policy.",
    "lead to persistent The Dynamic Infectious Diseases Public Health Response Framework is a model for evaluating ongoing public health policy impact in the context of a constantly changing and evolving system (Figures 3, 6). Concepts are grounded in implementation science theory and are a direct extension of the Dynamic Sustainability Framework (10).",
    "Key considerations are generalizable to many infectious diseases threats and associated mitigation measures and prevention responses. Focusing on maximizing public health outcomes has additional implications.",
    "For populations that are high-risk of severe disease despite vaccination (or for other reasons, depending upon the specific infectious disease in question) (47-49), different policy recommendations may be needed to achieve public health goals. For example, mitigation measures designed to prevent any COVID-19 case applied in skilled nursing facilities, dialysis centers, and chemotherapy units are expected to have a more substantial direct public health impact than when those same mitigation measures are applied to lower-risk populations, such as interventions implemented in elementary and secondary school settings. Acknowledgment of differential population risk was one of the reasons masking requirements were maintained in hospital settings longer than in the community (50).",
    "Thus, implementation of a Dynamic Infectious Diseases Public Health response requires measurement of population risk and adaptation of policy to match level of risk. In this setting, risk should be defined broadly, and harms and costs of the intervention should be included when crafting public health policy.",
    "Achieving future improvements in real-time infectious disease policy responses will require major infrastructure investments to collect the data necessary to inform ongoing public policy decisions. Traditional surveillance systems focus on measuring cases via reporting from state and local health departments.",
    "These traditional systems do not have the infrastructure or linkage to data elements that would facilitate evaluation and integration of implementation outcomes. Novel mechanisms for gathering and interpreting data in near-real time are needed; practically, this will likely include a national data repository, technologic advancements in data cleaning and real-time analysis, and integration of non- traditional sources offor ongoing assessment of public perceptions about different public health policies. For example, measuring trends about discussion of masking policies and school closures on Twitter and other social media sites likely would have provided valuable insight into information, such as social media, changing acceptability of these public health recommendations, and allowed for public health policy makers to integrate perceptions of end-users into ongoing policy updates.",
    "Similarly, early in the pandemic, ongoing discussions of lack of access to testing may have served as a signal to invest more heavily in this strategy. Inherent in the Dynamic Infectious Diseases Public Health Framework is the concept that as implementation outcomes evolve longitudinally, so does the effectiveness of public health policy responses (Figure 1). Thus, as a direct result of constantly evolving conditions, risk of the setting and to the individual, public perceptions, and political contexts, public health policy needs constant revision and evolution to maintain the same societal benefits (7).",
    "Challenges with sustainment of behavior change to control disease spread are not specific to COVID-19. Recommendations for use of barrier methods to prevent transmission of sexually transmitted infections, particularly HIV infection, and to reduce the number of sexual contacts, were eventually abandoned in favor of a more harm-reduction focused approach (51), as early abstinence-based public health recommendations were found to be unacceptable to many and therefore less effective than other approaches, such as treatment and PrEP (52-55). In the summer of 2022, when the Mpox outbreak occurred, public health recommendations that focused on reducing sexual contacts were heavily criticized, due in part to lack of acceptability and perceived appropriateness of the intervention among recipients of the public health campaign (56-59). The dynamic infectious diseases public health response: an extension of the real-time, learning health system approach The ideal of the Learning Health System is that data generated in real time can be leveraged to advance our scientific in our understanding of a problem and that advancement understanding can be leveraged to improve care delivery (6).",
    "Inherent in this model is the idea that \"the evidence\" is constantly changing and evolving, and that a variety of data elements are needed to realize potential benefits of this approach (60). Particularly when applied to the context of public health programs, data elements include not only traditional data elements but also other factors that impact real-world effectiveness - cultures, believes, attitudes and contexts.",
    "Integration of these other elements into policy evaluation is critical for achieving and sustaining public health benefit. Adaptation to changing conditions and contexts is the best way to incorporate evidence into policy changes but achieving the ideal synergy of specific policy recommendation to context and public perception requires substantial advancements and investment in data collection, analysis, and implementation. Substantial changes in contexts, evidence and phases need to be identified in near- real time, so that public health policy can be aligned with the current conditions.",
    "The more heavily reliant an intervention is on day-to-day, person-level appropriate use for effectiveness, Frontiers in Public Health frontiersin.org Branch-Elliman et al. 10.3389/fpubh.2023.1207679 FIGURE 6 Dynamic infectious diseases public health response framework for incorporating implementation outcomes into public health policy adaptation. The dynamic infectious diseases public health response framework presents variables that impact public health policy effectiveness.",
    "Optimizing the effectiveness of public health policy necessitates ongoing evaluation of each of these different variables, with updates as they change. the more strongly the duration of the intervention should be considered in weighing recommendations. Ideally, evaluations of the effectiveness of individual-level interventions should be ongoing, with constant reassessments of whether the intervention is continuing to achieve the desired outcome and immediate policy change once the intervention is no longer effective or found to be harmful. Costs and harms of an intervention should be evaluated in parallel with benefits and on an ongoing basis.",
    "Improvements in real-time data analytics are likely to result in earlier policy de-implementation as human behaviors and expectations are inherently integrated into public health policy making. Once the balance tips away from benefit and toward harm, the policy should be de-implemented, with clear and open communication about the emerging evidence and rationale for the change. Recognizing the inherent limitations of observational data, advancements in data management and rapid data analysis are needed for the next pandemic to enhance our understanding about real-time policy effectiveness.",
    "Given the role of perceived appropriateness of policy in driving compliance--and therefore effectiveness--improvements should also include mechanisms to assess and integrate public feedback into public health policy and messaging. Data about the feasibility, acceptability, and costs of different interventions, such as social distancing policies and business and school closures should be collected by public health officials and state and local governments from publicly available sources, such as social media platforms and google movements as well as directly from interested parties and individuals impacted by specific policy interventions.",
    "These data elements should then be integrated into planning and policy responses. Data about ongoing use could be used to inform whether policy effectiveness is likely to have changed due to changing conditions and public perceptions.",
    "Potential harms of interventions should be prospectively measured and incorporated into assessments of the ongoing acceptability and appropriateness of the public health policy. These data elements could then be mapped to quantitative data and used to tailor public health policy recommendations based on input from those most impacted and ongoing expected benefits and harms.",
    "An example application of integrating implementation outcomes into public policy design is presented in Table 3, which ranks NPIs according to feasibility and acceptability.

    "Although there has been significant progress in the available pharmacological treatments to alleviate disease symptoms and slow the disease progression in the past two decades, PAH has a devastating impact not only on the patient's physical daily activity but in several dimensions of health- Indeed, different related quality of surveys conducted worldwide have consistently shown that most PAH patients report that between a quarter and halfof from depression and anxiety symptoms; between half and three quarters are unable to work -with the accompanying reduction in average household income-; and a significant proportion report feelings of social isolation, reduced social activity, or disrupted sexual relationships, among other complaints (2-4). Of note, although PAH-targeted therapies improve HRQoL, especially for pharmacological the physical domains, QoL impairment may persist despite optimal treatment (5, 6).",
    "The results of these surveys support the need for multidisciplinary PAH management that should include healthcare providers (HCPs) and caregivers and take into account the patient's perspective (7, 8). Besides, PAH management requires an active, regular, and intense partnership between patients and HCPs that needs to be continued in- between visits to monitor medication adherence, identify and manage symptoms and adverse events, recommend self-lifestyle interventions, etc. (1).

For instance, mHealth interventions- frequently text messaging to send reminders, alerts, most education, motivation, and prevention- have been reported to improve symptoms of asthma, chronic pulmonary disease, or heart failure; glycemic control in diabetes patients; blood pressure in hypertensive patients; attendance rates, or improved adherence to tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus therapy (10). impact the studies, In the particular case of PAH, a recent review of the literature evaluating the use of eHealth strategies found that they were safe, accurate, and reliable, contributing to the clinical management of PAH patients (11).",

    "Lastly, none ofthe Considering that there is an increased recognition that the management of PAH must aim to reduce the impact of the disease in HRQoL (9), it has been suggested that it should be assessed through PAH-specific patient-reported outcomes measures (PROs) (3). PROs, which are a form of validated self-report instruments which use patients' views to assess their health status and wellbeing (12), can be systematically and electronically collected (ePROs) through eHealth technologies such as tablets, mobile phones, or web- based platforms (13, 14).

    "Besides ePROs assisting clinicians with early detection of complications, immediate action, and potentially reducing symptom burden, complications, and readmissions to the hospital, their use empowers patients and improves patient- clinician communication (13). Last but not least, the routine collection of ePROs may complement clinical evaluations by assessing the patients' perspectives on their HRQoL, unmet needs and concerns, and care priorities (14).",

    "In patients with T2D and hypertension previously using WC for their diabetes management, the addition of hypertension self-management education and self-reported blood pressure (BP) measures showed that the platform facilitated glycemic control while achieving a significant reduction in BP (17). Lastly, a study assessing the WC platform performance during the COVID- 19 lockdown showed similar decreases in average blood glucose to those observed in the pre-lockdown despite increased ePROs (18).",
    "The results confirmed that the use of ePROs was acceptable to patients as a supplement to the usual care at the physician's office, enabling patients to maintain continuity of care (18).

    "integrated Besides, into the patient's medical management, and none ofthe studies assessed the impact of the intervention in important clinical outcomes such as changes in HCPs visits, mortality, hospitalizations, and none evaluated its impact on HRQoL (11). The CBS-PAH clinical investigation described herein seeks to evaluate the acceptability and usefulness of the PAHcareTM digital platform to reduce PAH burden, including patients' emotional wellbeing. these devices were not in most cases, The PAHcareTM platform is anticipated to provide direct benefits to HCPs, patients, and caregivers. From the HCPs' perspective, PAHcareTM is expected to simplify routine the multidisciplinary approach needed to tailor PAH management, a chronic condition requiring ongoing monitoring and assessment.",
    "Besides, it should lead to more efficient use of health resources through the opportunity to optimize therapy or track adverse events. Moreover, the quantitative HRQoL assessment through the digital platform will enhance the patient/HCP interaction.",
    "This will help HCPs better understand the patients' individual needs other than those purely clinical ones, such as their experience with the disease in terms of functional burden and psychosocial impact. Lastly, since the PAHcareTM will be publicly launched for all PAH patients in the future, an added benefit of its implementation in routine care may be the generation of prospective, longitudinal, real-world data that may yield valuable insights into PAH epidemiology, progression, and patient's wellbeing, among others.",
    "From the patient's and caregiver's perspective, the digital platform can provide access to medical care in areas where such services may be limited, not regularly provided, or difficult to reach if the patient has restricted mobility or fatigue. Most importantly, it will empower patients to become more actively involved in managing and treating their disease, which has been shown to improve a range of outcomes in patients with PAH, including psychosocial wellbeing (7). Finally, the delivery of specific information and education on the disease from a high-quality source will help patients and caregivers understand the complexity and challenges of the disease and its treatment and show them how it will impact their physical and emotional daily lives (7). To our knowledge, this is the first study that will examine the effects of using mHealth strategies in patients with PAH.",
    "However, the study has limitations that must be acknowledged. Firstly, the clinical investigation design lacking a control arm (i.e., patients not using the platform) prevents the direct assessment of platform use effects. However, the retrospective assessment of clinical variables, including 6 MWT or CEPT, WHO-FC, and PAH symptoms and signs, may partially compensate for this limitation.",
    "Secondly, the prevalence of patients with marked or severe activity limitation (III/IV WHO FC) is low, while most patients without limitation of activity (I WHO FC) remain undiagnosed due to their mild symptoms. Thus, we anticipate that the clinical investigation population is likely to be biased toward patients with WHO FC II. To avoid this bias, investigators will be encouraged to pre-screen patients to balance the representation of less (I/II) and more (III/IV) severe WHO FCs.",
    "Other limitations of the study are associated with the digital nature of the platform, such as loss of data entered by the users, user interface errors, functionalities not working, or failure to access patient data. Additionally, non- adherence to the digital intervention, incorrect usage of the platform, and discontinuation of the intervention may interfere with the outcomes and interpretation of the results. In summary, the PAHcareTM digital platform will offer the opportunity to facilitate PAH self-management by providing continuity-of-care, encouraging patients' engagement, and promoting self-care behavior through educational content, lifestyle recommendations, patient data storage, and support of a remote HC.",

In turn, this international document defines persons with disabilities as persons with persistent physical, mental, intellectual or interaction with sensory various barriers, may prevent their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others (Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2009). At the same time, according to Ukrainian legislation, a person with a persistent disorder of body functions, which, when interacting with the external environment, leads to a limitation of his or her vital activity, as a result of which the state is obliged to create conditions for the exercise of his or her rights on an equal basis with other citizens and to ensure his or her social protection, is a person with a disability (Provision of auxiliary means of rehabilitation and other means of rehabilitation), 2022). (technical That is, the key factor for determining a person's disability is the presence of persistent health disorders.",
    "in Ukraine The war that began in 2014 and continues to this day has led to the following people being equated with people with disabilities: 1) participants in hostilities (certain categories of citizens who were injured, bruised, maimed or sick as a result of the military aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, participation in an anti- in the terrorist operation or implementation of measures to ensure national security and defence, to repel and deter armed aggression of the Russian Federation in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, being directly in the areas and during the period of military (combat) operations, and who lost the functional capacity of a limb(s)); 2) victims (civilians who, during the period of martial law in Ukraine or in certain areas of Ukraine, directly resided in the areas of military (combat) operations and during the period of military (combat) operations or in areas subjected to bombing, air strikes and other armed attacks and sustained injury, contusion, mutilation or illness as a result of the armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, resided in the areas of the anti-terrorist operation, areas of measures to ensure national security and defence, repulse and deter the armed aggression of the Russian Federation in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, provided that such persons have not committed criminal offences); 3) elderly people; 4) (Provision of auxiliary means of (technical and other means of rehabilitation), 2022). follows the analysis of Ukrainian legislation in the field of social and legal protection of persons with disabilities, because a number of guarantees established for persons with the legal status of persons with disabilities are also extended to the above-mentioned categories of the population. For example, in the cases established by law, regardless of the establishment of disability, they are provided with rehabilitation aids, medical products, rehabilitation services, sanatorium-resort rehabilitation (The Law of Ukraine \"On Rehabilitation of Persons with Disabilities in Ukraine\", 2005).",
    "children with musculoskeletal disorders rehabilitation This conclusion from According to the authors, social protection of people with persistent health disorders is a system of organisational, legal, economic, financial and social measures implemented by the state aimed at meeting the needs of this category of people in restoring and maintaining health, material security, self-realisation, unimpeded access to social infrastructure, and so forth (Kutsa, 2013). At the same time, public administration of social protection of persons with persistent health disorders is the activity of subjects of public administration aimed at administrative and legal regulation of social relations in the field of social protection of such persons with the purpose of satisfying their needs for health, material security, self-realisation, availability of the environment, goods, works and services, etc. and maintenance restoration of As for the definition of the concept of economic methods of public administration of social protection of persons with persistent health disorders, before Baltic Journal of Economic Studies Vol. 9 No. 4, 2023 formulating its definition it is necessary to determine the content of public administration methods in general and economic methods of public adminis- tration in particular.",
    "and dialogic-organisational Thus, the legal sources propose to understand the method of public administration as a way of practical implementation of management functions through the organisational- adminis-trative influence of the management entity on the behaviour and social activities of the managed object with a view to realising their mutually agreed interests (Chernov, Voronkova, 2016). There is also a definition of appropriate methods as ways of influencing public bodies on social and state development processes, as well as on the activities of authorities and certain officials, business entities and citizens (Yastremska, Mazhnyk, 2015). According to the authors, both definitions reveal the meaning of the concept they denote.",

    "encyclopaedic literature, In It In summary, economic methods of public administration of social protection of persons with permanent health disorders are a set of means and methods used by authorised subjects of public administration for the purpose of creating favourable economic conditions for administrative and legal regulation of social relations in the field of social protection of such persons with the aim of satisfying for restoration and maintenance of their needs health, material support, self-realisation, availability of environment, goods, works and services, etc. Interpreting somewhat O. M. Kostenko's conclusion regarding economic methods of occupational health and safety management, the authors of this paper support O. M. Kostenko's position that, unlike legal and administrative methods of management which the therefore fulfilment of certain require strict control over requirements regulate and their implementation, economic methods are more liberal, since they are based not on the fear of punishment, but on the economic benefit of the person to whom they are applied (Kostenko, 2016).",
    "It is also important to note, as N. V. Gritsenko and D. S. Kozodoi have rightly pointed out, that sometimes purely administrative measures have an economic incentive at their core. Therefore, the administrative-legal method of management at the end of the chain of cause-effect relationships becomes inherently economic (Gritsenko, Kozodoi, 2020). For example, the implementation of the 4% employment standard for people with disabilities entitles such employers to a number of subsidies and compensations, and prevents them from having to pay administrative and economic sanctions and fines.",

    "Characteristics of Specific Economic Methods of Public Administration of Social Protection of Persons with Persistent Health Disorders The Law of Ukraine \"On the State Budget of Ukraine for 2023\" provides for state budget expenditures for social protection of persons with disabilities in the amount of 3,441,816.0 UAH (The Law of Ukraine \"On the State Budget of Ukraine for 2023\", 2022).",
    "The funds are distributed among 15 areas, as follows: 1) provision of auxiliary means of rehabilitation (technical and other means of rehabilitation) to persons with disabilities, children with disabilities and other specific categories of the population, payment of monetary compensation for the cost of such means purchased independently; 2) for prosthetics and orthotics with products of increased functionality latest technologies and manufacturing using the technologies that are not available in Ukraine, and/or special products for sports for certain categories of citizens who have lost the functionality of a limb or limbs, including payment for banking services; 3) to pay one-time compensation and provide annual rehabilitation assistance to persons with disabilities and children with disabilities affected by explosive ordnance; 4) to provide financial support to NGOs providing social services to persons with disabilities; 5) to reimburse the cost of rehabilitation services for children with disabilities; 6) for the operation of rehabilitation institutions (centres for comprehensive for persons with disabilities and rehabilitation) children with disabilities, which are under the management of the Ministry of Social Policy; 7) for training persons with disabilities to drive a car; 8) transportation of vehicles to places of storage of confiscated vehicles or to enterprises engaged in collection and processing of scrap metal, technical inspection of vehicles, deregistration of vehicles in the territorial bodies providing services of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, determination of the suitability of vehicles for further operation and the degree of their wear and tear, conversion of vehicles for persons with disabilities into another modification, court and other expenses related to the return, seizure, storage and sale of vehicles; 9) for training and retraining of people with disabilities in educational institutions, centres for complex rehabilitation of people with disabilities in order to acquire a profession; 10) for organisational and technical support of the activities of the Fund and its territorial branches to control the receipt of administrative and economic sanctions and fines in connection with non-compliance with the standard of workplaces for the employment of people with disabilities, expenses for court fees; 11) provision of resort vouchers for persons with disabilities, of vouchers without for citizens accompanying persons with disabilities of the 1st group (with the exception of persons with disabilities resulting from injuries and diseases of the spine and spinal cord), payment of monetary compensation to certain categories of citizens, payment of monetary compensation instead of a resort voucher and the costs of independent resort treatment to certain categories of persons with disabilities, and payment of travel expenses for citizens accompanying persons with disabilities resulting from injuries and diseases of the spine and spinal cord; 12) to finance measures to promote the employment of persons with disabilities as defined in Articles 24-1 and 26, part two of Article 27 of the Law of Ukraine \"On Employment of the Population\" (employment of persons with disabilities from among internally displaced persons); 13) provision of preferential health resort treatment for the cost of and payment of compensation independent health resort treatment of persons in respect of whom the deprivation of liberty as a result of armed aggression against Ukraine has been established, as defined in Article 4 of the Law of Ukraine \"On Social and Legal Protection of Persons in Respect of Whom the Deprivation of Liberty as a Result of Armed Aggression against Ukraine and resort voucher instead of a treatment Baltic Journal of Economic Studies Vol. 9 No. 4, 2023 Members of Their Families has been Established\"; 14) financial support to ensure the functioning of state non-profit enterprises under the management of the Ministry of Social Policy of Ukraine (The Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine \"On Certain Issues of Social Protection of Persons with Disabilities\", 2023). Despite the fact that the number of directions related to the issue of disability, which are financed from the state budget, is quite large, during the war financial support was provided to public organisations of persons with disabilities, which have the potential to perform an extremely wide range of functions for providing and protecting the rights of persons with disabilities.",
    "Nevertheless, today they are still self-financed and are forced to seek funds for the implementation of various activities from international and national donors. Article 7 of the Law of Ukraine \"On the State Budget of Ukraine for 2023\" establishes the subsistence minimum per person per month for persons who have lost their ability to work in the amount of 2,093.00 UAH starting from 1 January 2023 (The Law of Ukraine \"On the State Budget of Ukraine for 2023\", 2022).",
    "A fairly common economic method in this area is to set price caps. For example, the Order of the Ministry of Social Policy of Ukraine \"On Establishing the Maximum Cost of a Voucher (Bed-Day) in 2022\" sets the maximum cost of a voucher (bed-day) for the provision of health resort treatment services to certain privileged categories of citizens, in particular, persons with disabilities from a general illness and persons with disabilities since childhood, persons with disabilities with consequences of injuries and diseases of the spine and spinal cord from among persons with disabilities from a general illness and persons with disabilities since childhood (Provision of auxiliary means of rehabilitation (technical and other means of rehabilitation), 2022).

    "At the same time, the legislation provides for a number of incentives and additional guarantees for employers. Thus, employers who have met the standard for jobs for people with disabilities and want to create additional jobs for this category of people can apply: a subsidy for the creation of special workplaces for the employment of persons with disabilities registered with the State Employment Service as unemployed in the amount of 40 minimum wages or 268,000.00 UAH (in 2023), if such a place is created by adapting the main and additional equipment, technical equipment at an existing workplace or on a free area of the production area, as well as in the amount of 100 minimum wages or 670,000.00 UAH (in 2023) if a job is created by means of installation of basic and additional equipment, technical equipment due to the impossibility of adapting an existing workplace or an existing section of the production area or the lack of places and sections; a targeted loan for the creation of jobs intended for the employment of persons with disabilities; financial assistance for the creation of special jobs for the employment of persons with disabilities (The Order of the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy of Ukraine \"On Approval of the Instruction on Provision of Financial Assistance on a Repayable and Non-Repayable Basis and Targeted Loan at the Expense of Administrative and Economic Sanctions and Penalties Received by the State Budget for Failure to Comply with the Standard of Jobs for Employment of Disabled Persons\", 2010).",
    "Baltic Journal of Economic Studies Vol. 9 No. 4, 2023 In turn, enterprises, institutions and organisations, individual entrepreneurs, including those who have chosen the simplified taxation system, in case of employment of persons with disabilities, have the right to set a single contribution to the obligatory state social insurance in the amount of 8.41% of the determined base of the single contribution for employed persons with disabilities, as opposed to the standard amount of 22%.",
    "For employers willing to hire registered unemployed persons, including persons with disabilities, who have not reached retirement age, for a new job for at least two years at the referral of the employment centre, the law provides for support in the form of compensation for actual expenses in the amount of a single contribution to the obligatory state social insurance for the person concerned for the month for which it is paid, but not more than double the minimum insurance contribution (The Law of Ukraine \"On Employment of the Population\", 2012). Small businesses that hire registered unemployed persons with disabilities for newly created jobs for at least two years by entering into an employment contract may receive compensation for actual expenses in the amount of a single contribution to the obligatory state social insurance per month for the respective person for whom it is paid (The Law of Ukraine \"On Employment of the Population\", 2012). In addition, employers willing to hire internally displaced persons, including persons with disabilities, who have been duly recognised as unemployed, may claim compensation for: 1) employer's labour costs; 2) employer's costs for retraining and professional internally development of registered unemployed displaced persons for a period of at least twelve calendar months (The Law of Ukraine \"On Employment of the Population\", 2012).",
    "For enterprises and non-governmental organisations of persons with disabilities, where the number of persons with disabilities is at least 50% of the total number of employees, and provided that the payroll of such persons with disabilities is at least 25% of the amount of labour costs, the single social tax is set at 5.5% of the defined base for the single social tax for employed persons with disabilities.

    "to provide services such law (The Tax Code of The Law of Ukraine \"On Public Procurement\" provides for the procurement of goods, works and services by a customer whose value is equal to or exceeds 50,000 UAH and is less than 200,000 UAH without applying a simplified procurement procedure, if the procurement of goods, works and services is carried out from an enterprise or organisation established by a public organisation of persons with disabilities and has received permission to use tax exemptions in accordance with the law (The Law of Ukraine \"On Public Procurement\", 2015). for As for licensing, according to O.H. Varhuliak, clear requirements for accessibility conditions are currently defined in three licence conditions, namely: in the Regulation on licensing and registration of the National Financial Services Commission and the conditions their financial services activities (The Resolution of the Board of the National Bank of Ukraine \"On Approval of the Regulation on Licensing and Registration of Financial Service Providers and Conditions for Conducting Financial Services Activities\", 2021), in the Licence Terms and Conditions for conducting educational activities (The Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine \"On Approval of the Licensing Conditions for the Conduct of Educational Activities\", 2015), and the Regulation on Bank Licensing (The Resolution of the Board of the National Bank of Ukraine the Regulation on Licensing \"On Approval of of Banks\", 2018). A number of other licensing conditions (Licensing Conditions for Conducting Business Activities in Medical Practice; Licensing Conditions for Conducting Business Activities in the Production of Medicines, Wholesale and Retail Trade in Medicines, Import of Medicines (Except Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients), etc.), although they contain relevant provisions, are purely declarative (Varhuliak, 2023).",
    "Non-compliance with these requirements is a ground for refusal to issue a licence. In connection with the question of the economic method related to the responsibility, it is worth mentioning that according to the Code of Ukraine on administrative offences, the offender must pay from 1,020 to 1,700 UAH of fines for stopping or parking vehicles in the places marked by appropriate road signs or road markings, where it is allowed to stop or park only vehicles driven by drivers with disabilities or drivers transporting people with disabilities (except in cases of forced parking), as well as creating obstacles for drivers with disabilities or drivers transporting people with disabilities when stopping or parking vehicles driven by them, illegal use of the identification sign \"Driver with a disability\" on the vehicle (Code of Ukraine on Administrative Offences). For example, in the first 8 months of 2022, parking violators in Ivano-Frankivsk paid 3.5 million UAH to the city budget (In Ivano-Frankivsk, parking violators paid 3.5 million UAH to the city budget, 2022).is incomplete, The given list of economic methods of public administration of social protection for persons with persistent health disorders it can be continued for a long time, however, due to the limited scope of the article it is extremely difficult to fully disclose the researched legal relations in the analysed area are developing rapidly, very often changes in legislation are made, especially in times of war.",
    "issue, and Thus, the above gives grounds to conclude that there is a fairly wide range of methods of public administration of social protection of persons with persistent health disorders. They are related to planning, taxation, licensing and other ways of influencing legal relations in the area under study. They are related to planning, taxation, licensing, liability and many other ways of influencing legal relations in the field of research.",
    "However, the analysis of the level and quality of life of persons with disabilities in Ukraine shows that the effectiveness of public administration methods in the field of their social and legal protection, including economic protection, is extremely insufficient. It can be assumed that the primary reason for this is the focus in the development, legislative consolidation and implementation of relevant methods not so much on the rights, legitimate interests and needs of people with persistent health problems, but on the interests of the state. In other words, human-centredness in the relevant state policy is insufficient.",
    "At the same time, the rate of disability in Ukrainian society today is very rapid. While in the pre-war period an average of 13,000 Ukrainians were diagnosed with a disability annually, in the first 10 months of the war in Ukraine, 45,000 people received the relevant legal status. And these are the people who managed to go through all the procedures required by law to obtain a disability.",
    "In reality, there are many more people with health problems. It is worth looking at the number of defenders who are injured, contused, ill, as well as the number of civilians who suffer from daily shelling, mine explosions, etc.",
    "Therefore, the emphasis in public policy, and, accordingly, in the methods of public administration of social protection for people with persistent health disorders, should be on the needs and rights of such people. The implementation of these methods should maximise the access of persons of this category to public and civilian facilities, amenities, transport infrastructure, road services, transport, information and communication, as well as, taking into account individual capabilities, abilities and to education, work, culture, physical culture and sports interests, Baltic Journal of Economic Studies Vol. 9 No. 4, 2023 (The Law of Ukraine \"On the Fundamentals of Social Protection of Persons with Disabilities in Ukraine\", 1991).

    "[1]. However, the potential of CPD programs is not fully realized as they tend to deliver arbitrary con- tent rather than to meet practical educational needs, selecting teaching methods based on educator con- venience such as lectures or observation. Much needed emphasis is now being placed on gap analysis [2], target- ing practice changes [3-5], and adult education practices [6]. A thorough evaluation of existing programs is the first step for applying innovative CPD approaches in edu- cational practice.",
    "The Education and Training Centre for Public Health- care at the National Medical Centre (NMC), here- after referred to as the Centre, plays a key role in providing CPD to 221 public health and medical insti- tutions (PHMIs) in South Korea. PHMIs are established and operated by the state, local governments, and public institutions [7]. The Centre is responsible for providing CPD to 57 PHMIs that fall under the supervision of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, comprising over a quar- ter of the total PHMIs in the country and 2121 physi- cians, as of December 2018, thereby making up 17.1% of the total number of physicians in Korean public health- care hospitals.",
    "Due to its sheer reach, the Centre is one of the most influential institutions in the public healthcare sector. The Centre's core values are to focus on enhancing publicness in healthcare and improving the quality of medical services [8]. Enhancing publicness in healthcare entails strengthening the role of PHMIs to fulfil unmet needs in the healthcare system, addressing areas where the free market typically fails (i.e., infectious disease out- breaks, natural disasters, or emergencies).",
    "Program evaluations should assess how well the Cen- tre's core values are realized and whether the intended changes have occurred. Educational programs are fun- damentally focused on change; therefore, program evalu- ations should assess whether the desired changes occur as a result of educational initiatives [9].",
    "The CPD setting calls for specific criteria that the program must fulfill. For example, since CPD is funded by public money, account- ability is particularly important along with potential effectiveness and administrative feasibility. In addition, it is important to assess whether the needs and objec- tives of the program are clear, as well as whether the program is tailored to meet these needs and objectives.",
    "The Centre's programs are required to prepare physicians for public health roles regardless of their prior residency training or specialty, to be capable of treating the major- ity of patient groups including chronic disease patients, and to be prepared to meet public healthcare demand in times of disaster. Among the diverse methodologies [9-11], the context, input, process, and product (CIPP) model has the most suitable characteristics for the evaluation of CPD in the public healthcare sector, which is affected by external and internal factors, as well as factor interactions.",
    "Situations such as the outbreak of new infectious disease or natu- ral disasters are what physicians in the public healthcare sector need to be trained for. They should also be able to respond to increased need for the treatment of chronic disease patients and issues, such as an aging population. Diverse participants and stakeholders, governmental and related ministries, that operate programs, program policies, and the calls from civil society also affect educa- tional programs.",
    "These factors influence each other. For these reasons, public health CPD should be treated as a nonlinear, complex, and dynamic system [12, 13].",
    "Informed by the complexity theory [14, 15], the CIPP model recognizes the importance of clinical and educa- tional contexts and accommodates numerous uncertain- ties within the educational program [9]. The CIPP model allowed us to recognize \"the dynamic, septic condition of the real world\" ( [16] p. 351), and at the same time metic- ulously considers the program environment and multiple inputs to the program, as is essential in the evaluation of public health CPD.",
    "Additionally, the CIPP model can provide both formative and summative evaluations [16, 17]; therefore, the model's strength lies in monitoring implementation and measuring improvements during and after implementation, typically on a yearly basis.",
    "Moreover, as CPD programs are funded by taxpayers, they must be held accountable. CIPP is particularly use- ful in this regard because all data involving strategy plan- ning, provision, and monitoring of education, as well as objective assessments, are translated into accountability data.",
    "Therefore, the CIPP model is suitable for use in the evaluation of CPD by the Centre. Methods We applied the CIPP model to evaluate CPD programs implemented by the Centre in 2017 and 2018.",
    "The Cen- tre offered 17 programs in 2017 and 10 programs in 2018. Among these programs, we evaluated abdominal and Kim et al.",
    "BMC Medical Education (2022) 22:261 Page 3 of 9 thoracic ultrasound programs because major changes were made to these programs, in terms of strategy, educa- tional goals, content, and methodology in 2018, following a needs assessment in 2017, which showed the strongest demand for change among other programs.",
    "Educational evaluation is useful for examining the effectiveness of a program after changes are made and for determining whether to continue the changes. To answer the evaluation questions in each phase of the CIPP model, data were collected from learners, instructors, operators, stakeholders, and external experts between May 2017 and January 2019 (Table 1). We eval- uated the abdominal and thoracic ultrasound courses delivered to physicians at PHMIs working under the Ministry of Health and Welfare.",
    "This study was approved by the institutional review board of the National Medical Centre, Seoul, Korea. We used the CIPP methodology as an ongoing evalua- tion tool. The ultrasound program and its feedback were reviewed in 2017 through context evaluation.",
    "Based on this, the 2018 program strategy was established through input evaluation. The planning and implementation of the program were assessed through process evaluation. Finally, the outcomes and impact of the 2018 program were reviewed and compared through product evalu- ation with baseline data from the context evaluation.",
    "Both formative and summative evaluations were per- formed using the CIPP model. The formative evaluation was executed by two of the authors, JL and HM, who participated as operators in continuous monitoring. The summative evaluation was executed by all three authors, including CJK, who participated in the record analysis as an external expert after the completion of the program in both 2017 and 2018.",
    "Context evaluation Educational needs, impediments, opportunities, assets, and resources, such as expertise and services, should be included in the context evaluation. To assess the educa- tional needs of potential participants in CPD programs, we conducted an online survey targeting 1010 physi- cians at 39 PHMIs, among which 204 physicians replied, Table 1 Questions used to evaluate CIPP components and data collection methods* CIPP components Evaluation questions Data collection method Context Input Process Product",

    "The FGIs targeting learners followed a democratic view of educational needs assessment approaches [18]. This approach is advantageous because it involves numer- ous stakeholders in goal-setting, thereby allowing them to determine the relative importance of potential needs. However, this approach may have uncovered partici- pants' preferences, rather than their actual needs, thus we did not rely solely on learner FGIs. The same research questions were posed to an expert advisory group to ensure that the potential shortcomings associated with FGI responses can be complemented by informed ana- lytical perspectives [18]. In addition, document review, literature review, demographic data analyses of learners, and 2017 program record analyses were included in the contextual evaluation.",
    "Input evaluation In the input evaluation, the most cost-effective and fea- sible strategy was selected to best satisfy the needs identified through context evaluation.",

    "A literature review, expert consultation, and stakeholder workshops were conducted to identify the strategy selection criteria [17]. Upon completion of the 2017 program, three external experts reviewed the records, assessed the outcomes and impacts, and made suggestions for improvement. Twenty-eight directors of public hospitals also partici- pated in the stakeholder workshop and developed the strategy selection criteria for the 2018 program.",

    "Upon the completion of each education module, par- ticipant satisfaction and reports of project effects on outcomes and impacts were surveyed. Academic achieve- ment was assessed at the end of the module and com- pared with pre-test results.",
    "An online survey assessing how well the learning was applied at worksites was con- ducted 3-6 months after the program completion. As stakeholders, an education and training review commit- tee (directors of PHMIs and medical education experts) evaluated the 2018 program and compared the results with the 2017 data.",
    "The CIPP methodology examines all outcomes related to education, from the intended positive impacts and short-term results to unintended impacts and long-term results [9]. Therefore, open- ended questions were included in the survey conducted after completion of the program to assess unintended outcomes. Results Context evaluation In the context evaluation, the educational needs of the recipients of the Centre's CPD program, impediments inhibiting participation in education, and resources that the Centre can utilize were identified.",
    "Our online survey results were analyzed for educational needs assessment (Table 2). Due to the low number of respondents, the online survey could not present a definitive conclusion regarding the current educational needs. Nevertheless, we considered this data important because those who answered are potential learners with educational aspira- tions. Moreover, issues with low response rates can be supplemented by other methods, such as FGI.",
    "Approxi- mately half of the 178 respondents (49.1%) reported that they chose to participate in educational programs based on the usefulness to their work.\" Therefore, developing practical CPD programs was an important task.",
    "When asked about what makes it difficult to apply learning to the work environment, 38.4% selected \"difference in hospital system,\" and 36.5% selected \"lack of manpower and equipment.\" This finding indicates that educational programs not considering learners' working environ- ments can become obstacles. In addition, 38.1 and 35.3% selected \"no one to cover the work while absent\" and \"inconvenient location,\" respectively, and 78.5% of the respondents reported preferring 1 day, instead of one night and 2 days, as an appropriate program period.",
    "Similar results were derived using FGIs, which were conducted to achieve an in-depth interpretation of the online survey results (Appendix).

These responses clearly indicate many barriers for participation in educational programs. Instead, increasing the tempo- ral and geographical accessibility of programs and mak- ing education mandatory have been suggested as factors that could lead to higher participation.",
    "The ultrasound educational program was the course that respondents most wished to take because it was the most applicable in primary medical care. However, the ultrasound program was cancelled several times in 2017 because of a lack of enrolment.",
    "This indicates that the content and delivery of education can prevent learners from enrolling in a program, despite high awareness of its utility, which is problematic. Whether it is applicable in the practical field is also a key factor prominent in FGIs.",
    "The groups, who responded to the overall curriculum in 2017 were good but not well-applied, pointed out that they could not use their learning in the practical field due to differ- ences between the environment of a hospital in Seoul and a remote local hospital. The environment, human resources, facilities, and even patient groups are vastly different from that of a university hospital in Seoul and a local hospital in remote areas.",
    "In addition, interest and practical applications are prominent factors in promoting learners' participation. Therefore, to recruit physicians as potential learners and draw good responses, educational content that can be applied in the environment where they work must be developed.",
    "In consultation with experts, expanding accessibility and providing educational content tailored to the roles played by public health institutions in the community were highlighted. In particular, significant gaps were observed in the actual clinical environment and patient groups between the learners and university hospital where the educational program was outsourced.",
    "In the literature review, two goals for PHMIs were revealed as immediate challenges: ameliorating the finan- cial independence of hospitals by securing sufficient prof- its and pursuing public interest in improving the health of the local community [19-21]. The fact that PHMIs must achieve these goals simultaneously was highlighted in 2013 through the closure of a century-old PHMI, Jinju Medical Centre, which caused significant social repercus- sions [22].",
    "In addition, labor productivity was found to greatly influence public hospital profits. Among them, the labor productivity of physicians accounted for a significant part of PHMI's labor productivity [21].",
    "Due to the lack of phy- sicians, only one doctor was placed in-charge for each department in most PHMIs. The directors of PHMIs may not be favorable toward physicians attending educational programs due to the financial losses caused by the lack of physicians.",
    "Considering these findings together, it was concluded that physicians cannot attend long-term edu- cational programs due to the current situation in hospi- tals. Based on the online survey results, FGIs, and expert consultations, the ability to quickly identify emergency patients or treat elderly patients with chronic conditions was especially important in learners' clinical environ- ments.",
    "The location of the program and program length were also critical. The abdominal and thoracic ultrasonography program was determined to require the most changes in needs assessment due to the largest gap between willingness to attend the program and actual participation rate.",
    "More- over, the Centre can potentially be held accountable for Kim et al. BMC Medical Education (2022) 22:261",
    "Page 6 of 9 cancelled programs if poorly planned during inspec- tions by the government administration. Therefore, we reviewed records from the 2017 educational program.",
    "Initially, the Centre planned to deliver three ultrasonog- raphy courses for a total of 10 classes. However, only six classes were completed, which leads to a potential accountability issue. Financial support from the Minis- try of Health and Education and administrative support from the Centre were secured for the program.",
    "Input evaluation Through input evaluation, we identified the best alter- native that satisfied all preselected criteria. After con- sultation with external experts and workshops with stakeholders, responsiveness to priority system needs, potential effectiveness, fit with existing services, afforda- bility, and administrative feasibility were selected as crite- ria.",
    "The abdominal and thoracic ultrasound program was maintained in 2018 because it fulfilled the priority system needs, thereby enabling the quick screening of emergency patients. However, it was clear that the program required improvement.",
    "We selected educational materials and providers through open competitive bidding by using a targeted outsourcing strategy for the abdominal and thoracic ultrasound course only. This strategy was deter- mined to be superior to the outsourcing strategy used in 2017 when a total of 17 CPD programs were outsourced en bloc to a single contractor.",
    "While the Centre provided administrative support, it selected one academic society in a related field that best fulfilled the criteria. One academic society fulfilled the criteria of respon- siveness to priority system needs and fit with existing services by setting the educational goal as differentiation of emergency diseases and achievement of skills required for quick referral in primary care.",
    "It also fulfills the cri- teria for potential effectiveness by establishing a prac- tice-centric educational method. By shortening the educational period from four nights and 5 days in 2017 to one night and 2 days, we satisfied the criteria of poten- tial effectiveness and fit with existing services.",
    "The edu- cational program described in the initial proposal was affordable and administratively feasible. For these rea- sons, the academic society was selected as the provider of educational content.",
    "In addition, considering the demand Table 3 Programme plan and outcomes for 2018 programm for improved geographical accessibility, we decided to provide education not only in Seoul, but also in other areas. Process evaluation After adopting these changes, the revised abdominal and thoracic ultrasound program was introduced in 2018.",
    "This program proceeded as planned and even had to be expanded due to increased demand. The initial goal was to educate 24 clinicians in two sessions with 12 stu- dents each. However, due to the increased accessibil- ity of the program, compared with the 2017 program in terms of time and location, more students signed up than expected. More sessions were scheduled, thus bringing the program operation rate to 150% and the education recipient rate to 187%, with both being higher than those in 2017 (Table 3).",
    "Two of the authors observed the sessions in real-time and recorded progress. The learners, instructors, and operators were requested to complete the free-answer questionnaires. The data obtained were then analyzed during a meeting at the Centre, where concerns were raised that the necessary capabilities may not have been sufficiently trained due to the shortened education period.",
    "However, the responses from learners during the sessions indicated that they were not only satisfied but also quite confident about their learning. The instructors believed that the learners had demonstrated the required level of competence. Freely-answered questionnaire responses were collected from all instructors, learners, and operators.",
    "The instructors said that the program was highly effective, citing intense concentration and enthusi- asm among the learners. The learners were satisfied with the learning content that could be applied in daily clinical practice and the diverse case studies they were provided.",
    "Many learners left comments thanking the instructors and operators. The operators described the vibrant inter- actions between the instructors and learners.",
    "Product evaluation Goal attainment was assessed by examining post-edu- cation improvements in academic achievement.

The educational satisfaction levels for the 2017 and 2018 programs (Fig. 1) showed that the 2018 program scored higher than the 2017 program, in terms of topic satisfaction, teaching method, applicability, and instruc- tor preparedness.",
    "In terms of geographic accessibility, the 2018 program scored lower than the 2017 program. However, respondents who considered the four nights and 5 days program held in Seoul in 2017 to be too long and distant did not participate in the first place, and only those for whom it was easy to attend participated, the 2017 participants may have been quite satisfied with the geographic accessibility of the program location.",
    "Based on an analysis of per capita education costs, the 2018 program accounted for only 84.1% of the total investment in the 2017 program. Three to 6 months after the completion of the pro- gram, the recipients were asked if they had experi- enced progress in their performance by applying what they learned in their work. On a scale of 1 to 10, the average score was 7.19. An obstetrician-gynecologist shared a story in a newsletter about how he successfully improved the diagnosis and survival rates of emergency patients after receiving ultrasound education.",
    "All short- and long-term effects were examined and reflected in the decision-making process. An education and train- ing review committee consisting of officials from the Ministry of Health and Welfare, public medical insti- tution directors, medical education experts, and phy- sicians conducted the evaluations and made decisions as stakeholders.",
    "The review committee pointed out that only a small number of students could receive ultrasound education because of the high cost of the program. Still, the committee agreed that the content of the program corresponded with the goals of public medical institutions and the Centre's core values, and thus evaluated the modifications carried out in 2018 to be effective for fulfilling educational goals. Accordingly, they decided to maintain the program, which was pro- vided in 2019.",
    "Discussion In this study, the CIPP model was applied to evaluate CPD programs targeting physicians employed by public health institutions in Korea. CPD provided to physicians working in the public healthcare sector has significant potential to directly improve the quality of community healthcare.",
    "To realize the potential of CPD to the fullest, program evaluations must be conducted thoroughly, and improvements to educational programs must be based on such evaluations. The CIPP method makes it pos- sible to highlight the context in which CPD is provided, which in our case was public healthcare and physicians in the public healthcare sector. In context evaluation, we emphasized the following factors: education is funded by taxpayer money; education should be geographically and temporally accessible to doctors working in diverse envi- ronments and facilities; education should rely on admin- istrative support from the Centre.",
    "Therefore, during the input evaluation, we adopted an education strategy that fulfilled the criteria of being responsive to prior- ity system needs, potential effectiveness, fit with exist- ing service, affordability, and administrative feasibility. Kim et al.",
    "BMC Medical Education (2022) 22:261 Page 8 of 9 Improvements were made accordingly, and enhanced abdominal and thoracic ultrasound courses were pro- vided in 2018.",
    "Through process and product evaluation, we demonstrated that the 2018 program had a higher number of participants, compared to that of the previous year (2017), as well as higher levels of participant satis- faction and cost-effectiveness. This study has limitations because it analyzed only one program provided by the Centre (which provided a total of 17 courses in 2017 and 10 courses in 2018) over a short span of time. Educational programs are constantly affected by factors within and outside the program. Therefore, it is clear that numerous programs provided by the Centre must have mutually affected each other.",
    "Needs assessment was carried out through surveys and FGIs, with the subject being the entire educational pro- gram provided by the Centre. The scope of this study was limited to an ultrasound educational program that was identified as a high pri- ority through needs assessment. Selecting one course for the program cannot expand its positive effects to the entire program (10 courses in 2018).",
    "In addi- tion, this narrow scope may have made it impossible to analyze the complexity and interrelations between programs. Moreover, the FGIs conducted in 2017 were based on voluntary participation, thus only 10% learners participated in the FGIs. Therefore, we can- not dismiss the possibility of bias toward the inclusion of enthusiastic learners.",
    "Long-term outcomes, such as the impact on patient treatment, were not evaluated. The study was based on data collected May 2017 to January 2019, when the 2017 program was initiated to when the applications of practical skills were surveyed for the 2018 program. Therefore, the long-term out- comes or impacts of the program have not been fully examined.",
    "Nonetheless, one obstetrician-gynecologist reported improvements in the diagnosis and survival rates of emergency patients after receiving ultrasound education. Despite the limitations mentioned above, the study has strengths in being comprehensive, having con- ducted evaluations at all phases beginning with the previous educational program, improvement and imple- mentation of the revised program, and evaluation of the revised program after implementation. In addi- tion, ongoing program evaluation is carried out based on a shared understanding, thus determining whether year-long education is being provided as planned can be reviewed later.",
    "We assessed not only whether the intended outcomes were achieved, but also how and why they were achieved, thus the process can be reproduced in the future, and accountability data can be secured in the future as well. Conclusions The CIPP approach is suitable for the evaluation and improvement of CPD in public health.",
    "It enables the analysis of interactions between internal and external factors affecting educational programs, as well as the context in which the program is provided. Therefore, the CIPP approach helps to produce desired changes in edu- cational programs and evaluate and improve programs funded by taxpayer money because accountability data are generated while simultaneously executing formative and summative evaluations.",
    "CPD programs administered by the Centre have the potential to improve quality of care provided by physicians in Korean PHMIs, and even- tually to enhance public health. The educational program we examined exhibited notable improvement after the application of the CIPP approach, thus we were success- ful in realizing our goals.",

    "The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) maintains a strong commitment to transfer the results of its science and technology programs to the private sector. The intent is to apply innovative and sometimes advanced technologies to address needs while simultaneously stimulating new commercial business opportunities.",
    "Such focused \"technology transfer\" was evident in the late 1990s as the results of DOE investments in environmental management technology development led to new tools for characterizing and remediating contaminated sites as well as handling and minimizing the generation of hazardous wastes. The Department's Office of Environmental Management was attempting to reduce the cost, accelerate the schedule, and improve the efficacy of clean-up efforts in the nuclear weapons complex.",
    "It recognized that resulting technologies had broader world market applications and that their commercialization would further reduce costs and facilitate deployment of improved technology at DOE sites. DOE's Albuquerque Operations Office (now part of the National Nuclear Security Administration) began in 1995 to build the foundation for a technology exchange program with Mexico.",
    "Initial sponsorship for this work was provided by the Department's Office of Environmental Management. As part of this effort, Applied Sciences Laboratory, Inc. (ASL) was contracted by the DOE Albuquerque office to identify Mexico's priority environmental management needs, identify and evaluate DOE-sponsored technologies as potential solutions for those needs, and coordinate these opportunities with decision makers from Mexico's federal government.",
    "That work led to an improved understanding of many key environmental challenges that Mexico faces and the many opportunities to apply DOE's technologies to help resolve them. The above results constituted, in large part, the foundation for an initial DOE-funded program to apply the Department's technology base to help address some of Mexico's challenging environmental issues. The results also brought focus to the potential contributions that DOE's science and technology could make for solving the many difficult, multi-generational problems faced by hundreds of bi-national communities along the 2,000-mile shared border of the United States and Mexico.",
    "Efforts to address these U.S.-Mexico border issues were initially sponsored by the DOE's Albuquerque and Carlsbad offices. In subsequent years, the U.S. Congress directed appropriations to DOE's Carlsbad office to address public health, safety and security issues prevalent within U.S.-Mexico border communities.",
    "With ASL's assistance, DOE's Albuquerque office developed contacts and formed partnerships with interested U.S and Mexican government, academic, and commercial organizations. Border industries, industrial effluents, and public health conditions were evaluated and documented.",
    "Relevant technologies were then matched to environmental problem sets along the border. Several technologies that were identified and subsequently supported by this effort are now operational in a number of U.S.-Mexico border communities, several communities within Mexico's interior states, and in other parts of Latin America. As a result, some serious public health threats within these communities caused by exposure to toxic airborne pollutants have been reduced.",
    "During this time, DOE's Carlsbad office hosted a bilateral conference to establish a cross-border consensus on what should be done on the basis of these earlier investigative efforts. Participating U.S.-Mexico Technology Transfer Page 1 border region stakeholders set an agenda for technical collaborations. This agenda was supported by several Members of Congress who provided appropriations and directed DOE's Carlsbad office to initiate technology demonstration projects. During the following two years, more than 12 private- sector and DOE-sponsored technologies were demonstrated in partnership with numerous border community stakeholders.",
    "All technologies were well received and their effectiveness at addressing health, safety and security issues was successfully demonstrated. Several of these technologies, including this effort, are now operational. Furthermore, a number of public and national security issues unique to the U.S.-Mexico border were brought to the attention of the federal government and are now being addressed, largely through the efforts of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.",
    "those noted above and demonstrated under Program results demonstrated the value and effectiveness of the program's process for technology exchanges. Opportunities now exist to transition the program from its successful initial stage to one where it can more effectively address a broader spectrum of multi-disciplinary problems that impact millions of U.S. and Mexican citizens. Substantial benefits would accrue to both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border were the two countries to continue this collaboration.",
    "U.S.-Mexico Technology Transfer Page 2 INTRODUCTION For several years, the Department of Energy's collaborations with Mexico's federal agencies have largely focused on energy cooperation. The common theme of this work has often included joint research and applications of innovative technologies that show potential for resolving challenges of common from DOE-sponsored laboratories, contractors and universities and a host of Mexico's counterpart organizations. Technologies often originate to both countries. interest In the mid-1990s, DOE's Office of Environmental Management (EM) began to plan a cooperative program with Mexico's government, industry and academic sectors on the use of innovative environmental management technologies.",
    "At that time, the program was sponsored by the International Programs Division of EM's Office of Science and Technology. Work was directed by DOE's Albuquerque office.",
    "Plans called for cultivating and then implementing a bi-national cooperation program beginning with information and staff exchanges that would foster mutual- interest relationships and help focus the program's out-year activities. DOE's initial strategy called for the program to broaden beyond exchanges to include: (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) U.S.-Mexico co-development of environmental technologies capable of addressing common problems Demonstrations of DOE-sponsored environmental management technologies that show promise for meeting Mexico's priority needs Joint deployment of DOE-sponsored technologies by U.S. and Mexican businesses Scientific exchanges that leverage the applied R&D capabilities of U.S. and Mexican academic and research institutions, and Technology exchanges that enhance the operations of the DOE weapons complex as well as U.S. and Mexican industry. It was widely recognized that these DOE-Mexico technology exchange efforts must be structured to achieve near-term benefits for the U.S. and Mexican governments and their citizens.",
    "For example, by applying DOE-sponsored technologies, the environmental management infrastructure of the U.S.-Mexico border region could be improved.1 This would, in turn, reduce health risks for both U.S. and Mexican citizens caused by exposure to pollutants from the region's expanding manufacturing industry. In parallel, technology developers would have greater opportunities to test and evaluate the effectiveness of their technologies under real-world operating conditions. Thus, the program's implementation model called for: Focusing on environmental management issues that are common to both the U.S. and Mexico (including problems associated with the clean-up and improved operations of DOE's weapons complex) or, at least, impact both nations 1 Under the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the U.S.-Mexico border region is defined as 100 km north and 100 km south of the international boundary.",
    "U.S.-Mexico Technology Transfer Page 3 Identifying and evaluating DOE-sponsored technologies that show promise for addressing these needs by matching technology performance parameters against the requirements faced by the problem holders Demonstrating technologies in collaboration with the problem holders under realistic operating conditions that would, in turn, expand the performance database of the technologies, and Deploying solution technologies that satisfy the problem holders' needs within an acceptable form, schedule and budget. It was believed that the above strategy would yield the following results: Successful technology demonstrations along the border that would create opportunities for greater commercialization Successful commercialization would generate new jobs for both countries through the manufacture, sales, distribution and maintenance of deployed technologies Commercialization would benefit those communities in greatest need of secure, long-term jobs and help elevate the socio-economic conditions of the border region Improved environmental quality of the region would reduce human exposure to toxins and trigger a host of benefits for public health and sustainable economic growth, including reduced healthcare costs and, potentially, improved academic achievement, and The schedule, costs and risks for clean-up of contaminated DOE, other U.S., and Mexican sites would be reduced by the availability of improved commercial technologies. U.S.-Mexico Technology Transfer Page 4 2.",
    "MEXICO'S PRIORITY NEEDS At the outset of this program, Applied Sciences Laboratory was tasked to review and consolidate data of Mexico's priority energy, water, and environmental management needs. The results served as a starting point for identifying DOE-sponsored science and technology programs that could be applied to address the priority needs. To do so within the program's narrow budget and schedule constraints, ASL leveraged work published in the open literature and obtained the support of Mexico's university Instituto Tecnologico y Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM) (Monterrey, Nuevo Leon) to build on existing data.",
    "Energy. During the period of the original investigation, Mexico's power consumption was growing at more than twice the U.S. rate.",
    "In order to keep up with growth, Mexico prepared to add 12,000 megawatts of electric power (MWe) to its electric power grid in the late 1990s - a 35 percent increase over the country's capacity at that time. Much of this increased power capacity is now provided by natural gas to help reduce air emissions. Also in the interest of improving environmental quality, the Mexican government emphasized energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, including: cogeneration; improved electric end-use efficiency technologies; hydroelectric power generation; geothermal power generation; wind power production; and solar power production.",
    "Water. Water availability is one of the most critical issues of Mexico's economic development. The northern part of Mexico - which comprises almost one-third of the nation's area and includes a number of the nation's major industrial centers - has only 3 percent of the available water.",
    "The north is also the region with the greatest rate of economic growth. Even the concentrated water resources of the south are not adjacent to major population centers since the cities are located at considerably higher elevations. Preliminary (unpublished) studies performed by ITESM's Center for Environmental Quality (CEQ) found that Mexico has an annual water deficit of about 38,000 million cubic meters.",
    "This is causing falling underground water tables. To meet daily water demands, water is transported from one place to another at enormous costs. For example, Mexico City (population more than 20 million), which faces enormous water problems, pumps about 80 percent of its water from aquifers faster than they can be replenished.",
    "The remainder of Mexico City's water supply is pumped 127 km from the Cutzumala River at a huge energy cost. Mexico's water distribution system also has serious problems as considerable quantities of water are lost through leakage.",
    "These extensive water pumping efforts are triggering concerns over damage to Mexico's ecosystems. Mexico's severe water supply limitation has prompted the federal government to carefully evaluate industries and determine the types that are most compatible with the long-range sustainable development of the country. Mexican officials have indicated that one way to correct the country's water supply challenges is to desalinate sea water - essentially for the mid and northern parts of the country.",
    "U.S.-Mexico Technology Transfer Page 5 Environmental management. Rapid urbanization and industrialization outpaced the development of Mexico's environmental infrastructure, particularly for municipal wastewater and solid waste collection and treatment. Mexico's priority industrial environmental needs include: air pollution control equipment; water and wastewater systems; resource recovery; hazardous and solid waste management and equipment, analytical and consulting services; instrumentation for measurement and monitoring; and pollution avoidance technologies. Mexico's 1990s market for environmental management systems was highest for water pollution control equipment and services as this represented about 40 percent of the total environmental market in Mexico.",
    "Other key markets included solid and hazardous waste management. The main sources of industrial solid waste remain manufacturing, mining, and oil processing.",
    "Mexico's state-owned companies have some potentially staggering clean-up projects. Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX) (national petroleum company), Comision Federal de Electricidad (national electric utility), and the state-owned railroad company, Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Mexico, are faced with large-scale remediation projects.",
    "The cleaning and upgrading of storage tanks (underground and aboveground) as well as the remediation of contaminated tank sites remain priority needs throughout Mexico. For example, many of the gasoline storage tanks at PEMEX's 3,000 gas stations throughout Mexico suffer chronic leakage problems. The number of industrial storage tanks that require cleaning and remediation services may be even greater.",
    "Furthermore, PEMEX owns many properties that are contaminated with acids and spent oils. The company's refinery units have major problems with hazardous waste disposal, especially polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The remediation of unsecured municipal landfill sites where hazardous wastes have been improperly disposed of is another important remediation issue. One of the most challenging waste management problems is the disposal of used auto tires which in some cities exceeds several million tires at unsecured sites.",
    "These sites are responsible for a number of serious public health issues that have been linked by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to mosquitoes and rodents that find haven in the tire piles. The ignition (accidental, malevolent, or by act of nature) of these tires is a serious health and safety risk.",
    "The smoke from a tire-pile fire causes large spikes in the concentration levels of hazardous byproducts. The resulting smoke threatens the respiratory health of the public.",
    "Air quality. Air pollution is the worst environmental problem facing Mexico's largest cities. The most serious air pollution problems are in Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey.",
    "The health effects of air pollution were estimated in the mid 1990s to cost Mexico City about $1.5 billion each year in lost economic productivity alone. Combined, these three cities are responsible for about 40 percent of Mexico's total atmospheric emissions. The transportation sector is responsible for more than 70 percent of the air pollution in these cities.",
    "Industrial sources (including power generation) are major contributors of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrous oxides (NOx), particulate matter, and other regulated pollutants. Mexico's industrial sector generates 4.4 percent of the nation's air pollution and the energy sector (including the petroleum industry) generates 4 percent.",
    "Natural sources (especially wind) accounts for 15 percent of air pollution. Industrial need for improved air-pollution control technologies can primarily be found in U.S.-Mexico Technology Transfer Page 6 the mining and foundry, energy, petroleum, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, chemical, steel, plastics, textile, rubber, pulp and paper, and electric-electronics industries.",
    "Solid waste handling. Rapid urbanization and industrialization in Mexico have driven up the need for greater solid waste management infrastructure capacity.",
    "In the late 1990s, only about 4 percent of the 526,000 metric tons of solid waste generated each day in Mexico was adequately managed. This is highlighted in Figure 1 which shows the daily solid and hazardous waste generation in Mexico. As depicted, about 15,500 metric tons of Mexico's daily generation of solid wastes includes hazardous materials.",
    "Met needs Unmet needs Units are metric tons per day. Total 525,885 Industrial 465,500 Hospitals Municipal 60,185 Hazardous 15,500 Non- Hazardous 450,000 Collected 42,130 Not collected 18,055 Disposal facilities Other Agroindustry Chemical Industry (Organic & Inorganic) Mining & Foundry Byproducts Landfills Open dumps 2,175 18,116 Source: Instituto y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey Totals: 20,291 (4%)",

    "Of the estimated 526,000 metric tons of solid waste generated per day in Mexico, over 85 percent (465,000 metric tons) is from industry. The main sources of industrial solid waste are the manufacturing, mining and oil sectors.",
    "As shown in Figure 1, approximately 15,500 metric tons per day of hazardous waste is generated by industry, while only 14 percent of the hazardous waste generated is properly disposed. The balance of these hazardous wastes, or 13,325 metric tons per day, may be mixed with non-hazardous wastes and, perhaps, left in open dumps.",
    "By the late 1990s, less than 20 percent of Mexico's population was served by any type of landfill infrastructure. About 50 percent of Mexico's population was served by an adequate municipal solid waste infrastructure. Only five of Mexico's 32 states had reasonably adequate facilities to dispose of municipal solid wastes. The situation was slightly better in the U.S.-Mexico border states where U.S.-Mexico Technology Transfer Page 7 about 25 percent of the population was served by the landfill infrastructure.",
    "At that time, only 4 percent of the total solid waste of the country was treated or disposed of properly. This issue has been identified as one of the key challenges facing the North American Development Bank in its efforts to help improve the environmental management infrastructure of the U.S.-Mexico border region.",
    "Hazardous waste management. Mexico has an underdeveloped domestic hazardous waste management industry. As of the late 1990s, the country had the facilities to manage only about one-third of the hazardous wastes generated each year.",
    "Mexico requires the full spectrum of hazardous waste management equipment and services. The largest sources of demand are the private sector and certain government-owned entities such as PEMEX.",
    "Mexico City generates about 38 percent of Mexico's total volume of hazardous waste. Most of these consist of spent solvents, oils and fats, and other wastes from manufacturing. Acid, alkaline and petroleum wastes are other toxic waste streams.",
    "These are generated mostly in: southern Mexico and the Gulf Coast where PEMEX operations are located; central Mexico where a rapidly growing mineral mining industry is located; and northern Mexico where coal mining is concentrated. Because most industrial hazardous wastes are either solvents (38 percent) or oils and fats (13 percent), improved recycling technologies are needed.",
    "The maquiladora industry is primarily situated along the U.S.-Mexico border region. Maquiladoras are in-bond facilities that were originally created by the Mexican government in 1965.",
    "They are factories that are allowed to import components into Mexico without tariffs for assembly. The components must return to the country-of-origin where they pay a nominal tariff on the \"value added\" to the product. As long as the imported components brought into Mexico are destined for export, no Mexican import duty is levied on the temporarily imported maquiladora inputs.",
    "Maquiladoras can manufacture a broad array of products under Mexican law. Exceptions to this allowance include such industries as petroleum, petrochemicals, and items which contain radioactive elements. The maquiladora industry was largely created to bring employment to Mexico's northern states.",
    "U.S.-Mexico Technology Transfer Page 8 INITIAL TECHNOLOGY EXCHANGE OPPORTUNITIES For several years, the DOE Office of Environmental Management maintained an aggressive national program of applied research and development to improve U.S. waste management and clean-up capabilities. The program initially focused on stimulating national laboratories, universities, and private industry to develop innovative technologies and then on applied R&D and technology demonstrations to prove the readiness of technologies for transition and deployment.",
    "R&D program areas included: Contaminant plume containment and remediation Landfill stabilization Mixed waste characterization, treatment and disposal Pollution prevention Decontamination and decommissioning High-level waste tank remediation, and Efficient separation and processing. DOE's investment yielded hundreds of innovative technologies to help meet its mission to clean-up the weapons complex and to prevent future environmental problems.",
    "In 1996, ASL conducted a comparison of attributes of 385 of these technologies for applicability to high-priority needs in Mexico and the U.S.-Mexico border region. Figure 2 shows the technology evaluation methodology utilized to screen the technologies. A review of available sources of technology information was conducted.",
    "Information sources included data available on the worldwide web that was developed by DOE focus area teams, publications (e.g., DOE environmental technology catalogues) that describe the status of development of the technology and its performance, and DOE databases. The relative merits of each of the 385 technologies were evaluated for their applicability to Mexico's environmental problems. Evaluations were based on: a technology's potential to treat specific contaminants in particular media; maturity of the technology; ease of implementation of the technology; and cost of applying the technology. Technologies that required a significant level of capital investment were often removed from consideration largely because of Mexico's limited economy.",
    "Technologies for treating high-level radioactive waste were also eliminated at the start of the evaluation because information on the extent of this type of waste was not available and not applicable to Mexico's priority needs. Technology matches.",
    "The evaluation of DOE technologies resulted in 179 of 385 technologies having potential to meet Mexico's environmental problems. The largest percentage (58 percent) of technologies came from the Contaminant Plume and Containment and Remediation Focus Area followed by the Landfill Stabilization Focus Area (25 percent).",
    "Table 1 lists applicable technologies categorized by DOE focus area groupings. U.S.-Mexico Technology Transfer Page 9 Figure 2. Technology evaluation methodology.",
    "Contaminant Plume Containment and Remediation The Contaminant Plume Containment and Remediation Focus Area had the largest number (103) of potentially applicable technologies to meet Mexico's priority needs. The majority of the technologies (76) in this group were applicable to soil contamination by industrial solid waste disposal at landfills or dumpsites, followed by surface and groundwater contamination, and finally air (emissions of soil vapor and stack gases). Landfill Stabilization The Landfill Stabilization Focus Area had the second largest number (44) of technologies.",
    "The majority of technologies in this group (39) were applicable to soil contamination caused by effluents to land (landfills or dump sites). Of the 39 technologies, 26 were considered non-contaminants specific because they measure geological characteristics.",
    "Mixed Waste Characterization, Treatment, and Disposal The Mixed Waste Characterization, Treatment, and Disposal Focus Area had 14 technologies that were relevant to Mexico's environmental needs. The majority of technologies in this group were applicable to soil contamination from Mexican industries.",
    "U.S.-Mexico Technology Transfer Page 10 Pollution Prevention The Pollution Prevention Focus Area had eight technologies that were pertinent to Mexico's environmental needs. The technologies were evenly apportioned between application to air emissions of soil vapor and stack gases, surface and groundwater, and land media.",
    "Decontamination and Decommissioning Four technologies were identified that had applicability to Mexico's environmental needs from the Decontamination and Decommissioning Focus Area. Two of the technologies were applicable to contamination in pipes.",
    "High-level Waste Tank Remediation The High-level Waste Tank Remediation Focus Area had four technologies applicable to air contamination of soil vapor and / or stack gases, geological data generation and monitoring of remediation sites. Efficient Separation and Processing The Efficient Separation and Processing Focus Area had two technologies potentially applicable to Mexico's environmental needs. Both technologies were applicable to water pollution.",

The initial basis for bi-national cooperation was the ASL-identified set of DOE- sponsored R&D programs that matched to Mexico's priority environmental management needs. In partnership with Mexico's ITESM university, ASL and ITESM staff arranged for and held numerous detailed meetings with decision makers from Mexico's federal agencies, including the Commission for Energy Efficiency, Secretariat of Energy, Secretariat of Ecology and Public Safety, and others.",
    "Coordination meetings were also conducted with the leadership of Mexico's federal research laboratories. Key results of these coordination meetings were several formal written expressions of the systematic implementation of the DOE-Mexico technology exchange program. These efforts led to the following strategies for cooperation: interest by Mexico's to proceed with federal agencies (cid:1) Scientific staff exchanges from among U.S. and Mexican research laboratories (cid:1) Co-development of environmental technologies capable of addressing common problems (cid:1) Demonstrations of DOE-sponsored environmental management technologies at selected industrial and government sites within Mexico, and (cid:1) Joint deployment of DOE-sponsored technologies by U.S. and Mexican businesses.",
    "This breakthrough work triggered initial steps to advance formal bi-national federal cooperation between the United States and Mexico on the resolution of hazardous waste management issues. DOE's International Programs office and the U.S. Department of State became engaged in this process. Specific research topic areas and collaborating organizations were identified, but further work was halted due to Congressional direction that altered the Office of Environmental Management's program priorities.",

    "The DOE Albuquerque and Carlsbad offices saw a common need for collaboration between the U.S. and Mexico in the interest of improving overall conditions in the border region. Background.",
    "The U.S.-Mexico border region is the land within 100 km on each side of the U.S.- Mexico boundary. It stretches from the Pacific Ocean represented by the Ciudad Tijuana / San Diego area to the Gulf of Mexico represented by the Matamoros / Brownsville area.",
    "The region encompasses parts of six Mexican states (Baja California Norte, Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and Tamaulipas) and four U.S. states (California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas). The region's 200-km wide land mass is home to more than 12 million people, with about 60 percent living and working in the United States. Circumstances peculiar to the U.S.-Mexico border region contributed to the foundation of the maquiladora program in 1965.",
    "A series of initiatives were pursued by the Mexican government to improve the economy of the region by taking advantage of Mexico's juxtaposition to the United States. One of the underlying program objectives was to improve employment in communities throughout northern Mexico.",
    "Rapid population and industrial growth in the border region have greatly affected regional water sources and spawned other environmental problems. Growth has exceeded the original infrastructure developed to serve a much smaller population.",
    "The results have been uncontrolled and untreated wastewater discharges, unsound disposal of municipal and industrial wastes, and escalating air pollution. This has also increased demand for energy and this, in turn, has added to the region's environmental problems.",
    "As a result, the U.S.-Mexico border region has some of the most serious environmental problems in the western hemisphere. These problems can be partly attributed to the area's transnational nature.",
    "Table 2 ranks the region's major pollution problems. Table 2.",

Ranking by Severity Description Shortage of clean water for drinking and potability Lack of proper disposal facilities for wastewater leading to contamination of water sources, food sources and natural habitat Lack of disposal facilities for municipal waste Need for increased energy generation Need to reduce air contaminants from vehicles and industry Need to develop an infrastructure for reducing, recycling, transporting and disposing of hazardous wastes U.S.-Mexico Technology Transfer Page 17 The region's water is supplied by numerous transnational river basins and aquifers. The 14 pairs of U.S.-Mexico sister cities share common air sheds with airborne pollutants freely moving across political boundaries.",
    "There is extensive industrial pollution of water, land, and air; dangerously inadequate water treatment and supply infrastructure; and acute shortages of facilities and systems to manage solid waste. Preliminary investigations suggest that these conditions present serious health risks to the region's population. Figure 3 shows the high incidence of various diseases compared to U.S. national rates during the late 1990s.

Many of these health issues may be attributed to the high concentration and rapid growth of industry and population in the border region, combined with relatively low rates of investment in institutional and physical capacity to handle the attending levels of pollution. Industrial growth in the border region has been driven in large part by the maquiladora program.",
    "It is estimated that over 2,000 maquiladora plants have located along the U.S.-Mexico border. Through the late 1990s, it was widely reported that many of the maquiladora plants lacked proper waste treatment or pollution prevention technology and practices. U.S.-Mexico Technology Transfer Page 18 The maquiladora industry contributes indirectly and directly to environmental degradation in the U.S.-Mexico border. Indirectly, job opportunities serve as a draw for migrants from central and southern Mexico, increasing local border populations.",
    "Maquiladoras also outsource some production to local factories that lack even rudimentary waste handling / management practices. (While research indicated that outsourcing to such plants was widespread and such plants' practices were alarming, evidence is largely anecdotal.) This has created an overload of the region's urban infrastructure and its fragile ecology.",
    "Directly, the maquiladoras adversely impact the border's environment through improper and / or inefficient disposal of waste material. Water quality. Based on available information, the status of the water quality in the border region, specifically in the California-Baja California, Arizona-Sonora, New-Mexico-Texas-Chihuahua, and Texas-Tamaulipas regions, was summarized by examining some of the major sister cities in these regions. The results are presented below.",
    "In the Tijuana-San Diego area, the Tijuana sewage system was originally built for a capacity of 17 million gallons of sewage per day (MGD). However, the average sewage production for 1995 was 35-40 MGD. Even today, Mexican and U.S. coastal residents in the Tijuana and San Diego areas are exposed to untreated water.",
    "1995 California EPA data showed daily release levels of 25 MGD of undisinfected wastewater and partially-treated sewage as well as 2-3 MGD of raw sewage into the Pacific Ocean six miles south of the border.",
    "Tijuana wastewater and storm water systems are combined. Therefore, industrial waste, laden with lead and pesticide residues, may still flow in the sewage system. In the Calexico-Mexicali area, the New River had the distinction in the late 1990s of being the dirtiest U.S. river with a flow at the border of 20-25 MGD of partially-treated domestic and industrial wastewater and about 3 MGD of untreated industrial wastewater. Previous monitoring reports revealed high levels of dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (synthetic pesticide, also known as DDT), PCB, chloroform, trichlorethane, toluene, xylene and fecal coliform levels that are several thousand percent higher than the level considered potentially fatal to humans.",
    "Warnings are posted to avoid bodily contact with the water. The Nogales sister cities are still plagued by the heavily contaminated Nogales Wash, a channel with a mixture of toxics and raw human sewage flowing through the downtown areas of Nogales, Sonora and Nogales, Arizona. There is no effective water treatment for the industrial and residential waste of Nogales, Sonora.",
    "In 1995, fecal coliform levels were often above Arizona standards by as much as 20 times. Up until the late 1990s, there was no water treatment facility in Ciudad Juarez. Open canals may still carry \"black waters\" containing run-off from the city's approximately 350 factories and raw sewage dumped into the Rio Grande.",
    "The Rio Grande remains so polluted by human fecal matter in this area that skin contact threatens exposure to cholera, hepatitis and dysentery-causing organisms. This untreated water is often used for irrigation.",
    "The situation poses a threat to Mexican farmers and consumers of Mexican produce on both sides of the border. U.S.-Mexico Technology Transfer Page 19 Air quality. Throughout the 1990s, and perhaps continuing today, the sister-city pair of Tijuana- San Diego competes with Juarez-El Paso for the most polluted border air. San Diego was cited as a 1995 non-attainment zone for carbon monoxide and ozone under the Clean Air Act. Most pollution comes from automobiles in both countries and the Tijuana maquiladoras.",

Maquiladora emissions, small brick factories, burning rubbish, and dust from unpaved roads comprise the extremely high level of dangerous particulate matter in the air.",
    "An ozone haze hangs over Juarez and El Paso much of the year caused by emissions reacting with sunlight. The ozone levels in El Paso steadily increased from 58 percent of the days each year having unhealthy ozone levels in 1992, to 67 percent in 1994, and 75 percent in 1995.",
    "Hazardous waste. The increase in border industrial activity led to a companion increase in the creation of hazardous wastes. The damage to the environment and threats to public health are largely caused by illegal dumping of hazardous waste along the U.S.-Mexico border that increased throughout the 1990s.",
    "U.S.-Mexico Technology Transfer Page 20 Much of the industrial waste generated in the border region was often reported as \"washed down the drain.\" In 1995, the newspaper Diario de Juarez reported that only 20 percent of industries generating hazardous waste reported proper disposal, while the disposal methods of about 44 tons of daily hazardous waste from the Juarez maquiladora zone is unknown. Oscar Canton Cetina, as Chairman of the Mexican Ecology Commission, revealed that each year, seven million tons of toxic waste is without control and illegally dumped in drains and marine waters.",
    "A spokesman for the Mexican National Council of Environmental Industrial Businessmen noted in an August 1995 Excelsior interview that the inspection of the maquiladora industry is virtually non-existent.",
    "The increase in the amount of unrecorded hazardous waste and improper disposal throughout the 1990s is in direct correlation to the incentives for illegal dumping. Mexico's depressed economy was often a stimulus for illegal waste dumping by the maquiladora industry due to the high cost of proper disposal.",
    "In addition, the Mexican depression resulted in public spending being slashed and government regulators had fewer resources to investigate and prosecute illegal dumping. Border population. Almost 90 percent of the border region's population resides in urban areas. For the most part, these urban areas include 14 sister-city communities located along the border, each composed of a U.S. and Mexican city closely related by proximity, commerce, and shared resources.",

    "With the support of the New Mexico and Texas Congressional delegations, DOE's Albuquerque office initiated and DOE's Carlsbad office assumed sponsorship and led the implementation of a number of technology demonstration projects. Several of these projects required funding for additional development, test and evaluation activities prior to demonstration. Some of these projects are discussed below.",
    "Reducing Brick Kiln Emissions The first project was an applied technology development, test and evaluation effort conducted by New Mexico State University (NMSU), under the direction of Applied Sciences Laboratory. The resulting technology was later demonstrated and showcased. The project's origins were in materials science work that had been conducted by a scientist and student intern at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL).",
    "The intern later continued this work as part of his dissertation for a doctoral degree under the direction of a professor within the NMSU Chemistry Department. The candidate's work was assisted by a graduate student from Mexico who also earned a doctoral degree from NMSU in chemistry. Background. For many generations, small groups of Mexican citizens along the border have been earning a living by making bricks that are widely used by U.S. and Mexican consumers.",
    "The traditional brick-fabrication techniques that are employed are similar to those used for centuries to make adobes. The bricks are baked at high temperatures long enough for them to \"vitrify\" so that the bricks achieve acceptable structural and thermal performance properties. Traditional brick-making ovens are thermally inefficient and highly polluting.",
    "Furthermore, the brick makers' resource constraints make it necessary to use low-cost materials as fuel. These fuels normally include scrap woods, but plastics, industrial woods treated with preservatives, used auto tires, and used motor oils are often used, despite their prohibition, because they are cheap and readily available. The airborne by-products of each of these fuel materials are highly toxic; thus, this industry has become a very serious threat to the region's public health and to the environment.",
    "During the late 1990s, up to 400 kilns were in operation in Ciudad Juarez while about 3,000 kilns operated along the 2,000 mile U.S.-Mexico border region. An independent study found that emissions from these kilns account for up to $150 million per year in related health care costs in Ciudad Juarez and about $15 million per year in related health care costs in El Paso, Texas.",
    "The brick makers face more immediate and direct hazards, since they must stoke the fires from above the open air kilns and losing one's balance results in severe burns or death. U.S.-Mexico Technology Transfer Page 29 Solution.",
    "Initially, efforts were undertaken to enclose the kiln using the same clay material that encompasses the kiln. While this reduced emissions dramatically and eliminated most of the hazards to brick makers, it prevented observation of temperature evenness. The solution to this was observation ports in the kiln perimeter and an ingeniously simple rod device that extended aluminum cans into the kiln. Melting of the cans confirmed adequate uniform temperatures.",
    "The key to the technology, however, was tapping the tremendous surface areas in clays and valence in order to absorb large volumes of contaminants and trap them within the clay matrix. Essentially the same material being fired in the kiln (bricks) became the filtration media. Optimizing this materials science application involved an engineering application that also addressed a key inefficiency of the single stage kiln design. Once an enclosed, single stage kiln was fired, it still had to cool down before another batch of bricks could be baked. This wasted time and costly fuel.",
    "By applying simple heat exchange engineering principals to the kiln design, two smaller kilns were connected to the main kiln and heat that was released was now conserved in the two secondary kilns. Unbaked bricks were staged in the secondary kilns and absorbed the airborne contaminants from the primary kiln that was being fired. Once the bricks in the primary kiln were vitrified, residual heat was channeled into the secondary kilns and those kilns were fired with a minimum of heat loss to bake the next batch of bricks. The resulting, three-stage kiln design, named the \"Marquez kiln\" after its designer, was a closed- loop system that fires bricks in the central or end chambers and traps the contaminants in the system's unfired bricks.",
    "It combined high-tech materials science and engineering with low-tech materials and construction techniques. Prototype tests revealed that the design captured 97 percent of all airborne particulates, was 64 percent more efficient, reduced energy costs by 63 percent, increased productivity by 33 percent, and improved material strength by 24 percent. It also virtually eliminated all health and safety risks of operation.",
    "The improved kiln design is also appropriate and sustainable technology. Construction of the kiln required the same clay material as the traditional kilns; a material that is both inexpensive and readily available.",
    "Construction costs increased about 60 percent due to the additional labor to make the adobe bricks and assemble the kiln. Nevertheless, the economies are evident to the brick makers and serve as the incentive to invest. Status.",
    "The prototype kiln was constructed in Ciudad Juarez by a local brick maker who partnered with NMSU in the spring of 2000. This effort was successful largely because the development team worked in close collaboration with the region's brick makers.",
    "This helped ensure the acceptance of the technology as it was being advanced. The kiln was successfully demonstrated in August 2001. A scaled-down working model was also showcased on the Capitol Mall as part of the Smithsonian Institution's Folk Life Festival.",
    "The improved kiln design has application worldwide as the traditional Mexican brick-making process and technology is evident in many of the developing countries of Latin America, Africa, Asia Minor, the Subcontinent, and East Asia. Following demonstration, the design was reevaluated and, with support from the U.S. Congress, additional design improvements were developed to increase brick-making capacity and recycle scarce water that is used during production. The improved design was constructed in Ciudad U.S.-Mexico Technology Transfer Page 30 Juarez and tested in 2002-03.",
    "Project costs were shared with the private sector and local governments. The Marquez kiln is now deployed at a number of U.S. border communities, in central Mexico, and in other Latin American countries. Deployment of the Marquez kiln has been steady, but slower than achievable. Deployments have been primarily funded by the private sector from the U.S. and Mexico.",
    "The resulting technology has the potential to revolutionize brick-making cottage industries throughout arid, developing regions of the world. After completing their doctorate degrees in chemistry, NMSU researchers continue work on the Marquez kiln and are conducting further research on the use of clays for a variety of environmental and public health applications that are specific to the U.S.-Mexico border region. Recycling Used Tires",
    "The second project was also an applied technology development, test, and evaluation effort. The technology's original development was funded by industry and resulted in a 1990 U.S. Patent for the inventor's gasification technology. Patent award was followed by a DOE Regional Biomass Energy Program (RBEP) 1991 grant awarded to Thermogenics, Inc. (Albuquerque, NM) to demonstrate the gasification technology.",
    "Then, in 1994 Thermogenics entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with Sandia National Laboratories and the State of New Mexico Technology Enterprise Corporation for further development of the gasification technology. Thermogenics received in 1998 a second RBEP grant to develop the gas-to-liquid fuels capability of its gasification technology. Background.",
    "In the United States, it is rare to hear of waste management and public health issues associated with used auto and truck tires. The U.S. possesses an infrastructure for the disposal and recycling of used tires. Conditions in Mexico are quite different.",
    "In fact, many used tires from the U.S. migrate to Mexico, particularly to the border communities due to the low cost of used tires and depressed economic conditions in Mexico. This drives the requirement to dispose of these tires once they are no longer usable at a much higher per-capita level in Mexico's border communities versus the conditions in the United States. This situation has led to the accumulation of very large piles of used tires within Mexico's border communities at a rate that far exceeds the capability to dispose / recycle them. For example, Mexican authorities have provided unofficial estimates of the inventory of used tires in Ciudad Juarez exceeding 8 million tires at the city's primary tire disposal site.",
    "In Ciudad Juarez, and other border communities, these sites are simply large piles of tires above ground. These unsecured sites provide little protection against malicious acts. Accordingly, these sites present a number of concerns to border communities.",
    "(cid:1) One of the greatest concerns is a tire fire and the immediate effects on public health, the economy, commerce, and the environment. Should any of these tire piles catch fire, it is unlikely that even a bi-national fire department response would have the capability to extinguish the fire.",
    "It is common practice in the U.S. to allow tire-pile fires to burn until the fuel source (tires) is depleted. This is because tires have an enormous energy content and, therefore, burn with intense heat at levels that exceed the practical capability to extinguish them. Should this scenario be carried out, for example, in Ciudad Juarez, the impacts would U.S.-Mexico Technology Transfer Page 31 be catastrophic.",
    "The region's air shed would experience very high concentration levels of toxic compounds. U.S. and Mexican citizens would experience daily challenges to their respiratory systems to varying degrees depending on their health as well as wind direction and other environmental conditions for any given day. The effects of the airborne particulate and compounds would impact crop production and quality, the meat and poultry industry, and others.",
    "One should expect this condition to last not just for days or weeks, but for months; perhaps even for more than a year. (cid:1) (cid:1)",
    "Tire piles are ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes and rodents. The mosquitoes find haven in the fiber structure of tires where they re-produce. Large rodent populations are also commonly found in the tire piles.",
    "Mosquitoes and rodents are a clear threat to the Mexican public. To what degree this situation threatens Americans is dependent on the location of the tire piles and the travel distances of the mosquitoes and rodents.",
    "There is clear evidence (e.g., Centers of Disease Control) that there are escalating levels of U.S. and Mexican citizens experiencing serious health issues associated with exposure to mosquitoes. These are certainly linked to mosquitoes and perhaps linked to rodents. Under the present situation, some U.S. and Mexican citizens face these unhealthy conditions for their entire lifetimes.",
    "Airborne pollutants are just one of the by-products of tire fires. Tire fires will also generate hazardous and toxic liquid byproducts that will migrate from the ground surface to below ground. The extent of migration is dependent on several factors, one of which is the soil properties.",
    "Thus, this situation poses a threat to the region's aquifers. The extent of contamination of these aquifers is unknown, but it is clear that many border region communities face water shortages and can ill-afford damage to their aquifers. Solution.",
    "Used tires are a source of useful energy. Rather than being discarded and collecting in solid waste sites, used tires are sometime recycled into several forms such as pavement materials, park benches, and other products. The cement industry recognizes the enormous heat value of used tires and often burns them in the production of cement.",
    "But, it is clear, that in some parts of the world (and certainly in the U.S.-Mexico border region) the generation rate of used tires exceeds the recycling rates. Some entrepreneurs have become aware of this situation and recognize the economic value of used tires.",
    "A few have made it their priority to advance and potentially commercialize technology that can cleanly and effectively recycle used tires into useful energy forms. Thermogenics, Inc. has been designing and testing a tire-recycling system that converts shredded tires to a gaseous fuel for more than a decade.",
    "While the process is not yet commercially successful, Thermogenics has achieved used-tire fuel conversion in a form that can power an internal engine and, in turn, drive an electric generator that produces electric power. This end-to- end functionality has been achieved on a single platform at the company's test and evaluation facilities.",
    "Recognizing the importance of this issue and the potential contribution of the Thermogenics tire-recycling system, the Department of Energy's Albuquerque and Carlsbad offices sponsored a demonstration of the Thermogenics system during fiscal year 2000. U.S.-Mexico Technology Transfer Page 32 Status.",
    "The demonstration, held at the Thermogenics facility, included 20 participants from U.S. and Mexican government offices and the business and academic sectors. During the demonstration, the system's shredded-tire input stream was converted to a methane-based gas and the gas, in turn, successfully powered an internal combustion engine. The engine drove a generator.",
    "DOE's Carlsbad office then sponsored follow-up work that focused on further testing and improvements of tire-recycling technology. The follow-up work was completed and did not advance further due to funding setbacks for the program.",
    "Other Technology Demonstrations Personal Ice Cooling System (PICS). For workers who must perform their duties in thermally hot environments, the potential of heat stress is a serious occupational concern. When subject to heat stress, a worker's judgment is impaired and can quickly suffer heat exhaustion.",
    "The problem is compounded for emergency responders of U.S.-Mexico border communities who face harsh summer temperatures and who are required to wear protective clothing during the course of their duties. Consequently, they can only work in 15-minute intervals safely.",
    "In response, DOE sponsored the demonstration in 2000-01 of PICS - originally developed under DOE sponsorship to address worker health concerns in high-temperature environments associated with clean-up and decommissioning activities of the weapons complex. The demonstration was conducted in partnership with the DOE Fernald Environmental Management Project; Nogales, Arizona Fire Department; El Paso, Texas Fire Department; Laredo, Texas Fire Department; White Sands Missile Range; Fort Bliss Army Base; Nogales, Sonora (Mexico) Office of Civil Protection; and the Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua (Mexico) Environmental and Civil Protection Departments. PICS successfully emerged as a cost-effective tool for reducing emergency responders' heat stress and was immediately deployed at seven border region communities.",
    "in that the soil Electromagnetic radiography. Many border communities are concerned about known and perceived hazardous contaminants threaten public health. Conventional characterization methods are costly and slow.",
    "This technology was first developed by U.S. industry in collaboration with Sandia National Laboratories to detect buried waste drums and other materials. Electromagnetic radiography is routinely used to detect and characterize subsurface hazards to soil depths up to 48 feet. Demonstration of electromagnetic radiography was conducted in 2001 in the Nogales sister city community in partnership with the Nogales Economic Development Foundation, Tucson Environmental Management Division, and the Nogales, Sonora Office of Civil Protection.",
    "The demonstration team identified a potentially contaminated plume in a highly-populated residential area; at another site, the team located tunnels used for illegal operations. The demonstration confirmed the technology's value in locating and identifying subsurface contaminants within just a few hours and without extracting costly borehole samples.",
    "Sediment Erosion Field Measurement. The El Paso Valley is heavily stressed by development and population pressures.",
    "Because the quality of surface water is so important to human health, technologies that aid in managing and protecting this valuable resource from contamination are needed. Sandia National Laboratories carried out the demonstration in 2001-02 of the Sediment Erosion Field Measurement technology for gauging erosion and the transport potential of sediments in the Rio Grande.",
    "Work was carried out in partnership with the International Boundary and Water Commission, University of Texas at El Paso, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the U.S.-Mexico Technology Transfer Page 33 Autonomous University of Ciudad Juarez. The technology has since been used extensively on near-shore and river systems throughout the United States.",
    "Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). There remains serious concern over the tremendous volumes of container and trailer ingress into the U.S. each year - estimated to be 16 million shipments. Only a fraction of shipments are inspected. In partnership with the U.S. transportation industry, DOE sponsored a 2002 demonstration of the RFID technology for its effectiveness in detecting the unauthorized intrusion and breach of a locked truck trailer or cargo container.",
    "Conducted in Laredo, Texas, the demonstration included simulated breaches into a trailer. The demonstration utilized an origin and destination chokepoint, where the system is activated and secured during each demonstration cycle. The status of the trailer, as indicated by the RFID system, revealed that the cargo container had been breached.",
    "Notification of the breached condition was successfully downloaded from the Internet in real-time and displayed. The RFID security system detected and immediately reported the time and date of the unauthorized trailer breaches. Today, RFID is widely applied by Customs and Border Protection operations.",
    "Quick-SLAB toxic gas dispersion modeling system. Typically, following notification of a toxic release, it takes 90 minutes for trained emergency responders to gather information on the release, enter data to a software code, execute the code, and interpret results.",
    "Dense industry and population in many border communities make 90-minute predictions too long to help ensure public safety. Furthermore, the difficulty of using conventional air-dispersion codes often discourages emergency responders from using them in a crisis.",
    "To overcome these challenges, Applied Sciences Laboratory linked the SLAB air-dispersion code - developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory - with an innovative user interface comprising of databases of toxic chemical inventories, their locations, and the locations of community facilities, along with an automated weather-station interface. This capability allows the emergency responder to rapidly predict, display and report toxic gas releases from industrial and municipal accidents.",
    "The resulting Quick- SLAB system was successfully developed, field tested, and deployed in 2002-03 in partnership with the Nogales, Arizona Fire Department; Nogales, Sonora (Mexico) Office of Civil Protection; and Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua (Mexico) Environmental and Civil Protection Departments. Quick- SLAB, which cuts air-dispersion prediction time to less than 10 minutes, is now a bilingual tool routinely used to protect the binational interests of the U.S. and Mexico.",
    "Solar water distiller. Colonias are faced with the daily challenge of securing a dependable potable water supply. Residents must haul their own water and store it in barrels. The water is often of poor quality with high dissolved solid content. DOE sponsored the demonstration in 2003 of the SolAqua, Inc. (El Paso, Texas) solar distiller system in Ciudad Juarez.",
    "The system had been advanced with the earlier support of materials and manufacturing expertise from Sandia National Laboratories with the goal of achieving affordable and effective household solar distillers for the border region's colonias. The demonstration revealed contaminant issues in the purified water. However, these issues were traced by researchers to the use of commercial water hoses that introduced additional water contaminants into the process. Recommendations focused on resolving this additional waste stream before proceeding with technology deployment.",
    "U.S.-Mexico Technology Transfer Page 34 8. RECOMMENDATIONS This report chronicles in a summary fashion work that was initially undertaken to expand the application and impact of the Department of Energy's environmental technology development program through collaborations with Mexico.",
    "The shift in focus towards U.S.-Mexico border security and prosperity was prompted by the results of the earlier investigations and growing recognition over the course of these investigations that U.S. and Mexican interests converge most markedly along the border. Yet, from the Mexican perspective, conditions on the border, or frontera, are relatively good by comparison with other regions of the country. Accordingly, it behooves the U.S. to assume a lead role in improving border conditions.",
    "In this regard, there needs to be a U.S. focal point that draws upon the expertise of various federal agencies, industry, academia and the communities along the border to focus on coordinated solutions. The Department of Energy, as a major science and technology organization, has much to contribute to this effort, but is not in a position to address issues outside its mission space any more than any other federal agency can.",
    "Much has been accomplished by the Department in collaboration with U.S. and Mexican organizations. However, much more remains to be done. It is recommended that an entity be established with the mandate and resources to lead such an effort.",
    "It is also recommended that the Department of Energy continue in a support role to provide new and innovative technologies and approaches in addressing border needs.

All of us associated with the journal are very proud of this milestone, but at the same time we are aware of the need to continually assess progress toward original goals and make changes when and where needed.",
    "EID's genesis stems from advice to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) promulgated by the 1992 Institute of Medicine report, Emerging Infections: Microbial Threats to Health in the United States (1). EID was envisaged as a vital component of CDC's effort to communicate the threat of emerging infec- tions worldwide.",

Its broad-based content would mirror the complex microbial, demographic, genetic, economic, technologic, behavioral, social, and other factors (including nefarious ones) that contribute to infectious disease emergence. The format would include views and summaries of major disease top- ics and trends, reports of new agents, reservoirs or foci of infection, and timely or preliminary results of relevant research.",
    "To make possible swift global dissemination of this compelling content, the journal would be fully elec- tronic and be distributed free of charge, a concept being robustly discussed in 2005 by many editors and publishers under the topic of \"open access.\" Special features were soon added to emphasize the links between science, public health, and the human condition. If submissions and subscriptions are a measure of read- er interest, Emerging Infectious Diseases has enjoyed some success during its first decade.",
    "Readership (infec- tious disease professionals in academia, clinical practice, industry, public health, and related disciplines) has grown from 3,000 subscribers in 1995 to >45,000 (print and online, >6,000 international). Submissions are increasing and number >120 per month.",
    "Although most submissions *Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia,USA come from scientists in the United States and western Europe, manuscripts continue to arrive in substantial and increasing numbers from every part of the globe.

    "The risks of HIV transmission associated with the opioid epidemic make cost-effective pro- grams for people who inject drugs (PWID) a public health priority. Some of these programs have benefits beyond prevention of HIV--a critical consideration given that injection drug use is increasing across most United States demographic groups. To identify high-value HIV prevention program portfolios for US PWID, we consider combinations of four interven- tions with demonstrated efficacy: opioid agonist therapy (OAT), needle and syringe pro- grams (NSPs), HIV testing and treatment (Test & Treat), and oral HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).",
    "Methods and findings We adapted an empirically calibrated dynamic compartmental model and used it to assess the discounted costs (in 2015 US dollars), health outcomes (HIV infections averted, change in HIV prevalence, and discounted quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of the four prevention programs, considered singly and in combination over a 20-y time horizon. We obtained epidemiologic, economic, and health utility parameter estimates from the literature, previously published models, and expert opin- ion.",
    "We estimate that expansions of OAT, NSPs, and Test & Treat implemented singly up to 50% coverage levels can be cost-effective relative to the next highest coverage level (low, medium, and high at 40%, 45%, and 50%, respectively) and that OAT, which we assume to have immediate and direct health benefits for the individual, has the potential to be the high- est value investment, even under scenarios where it prevents fewer infections than other programs. Although a model-based analysis can provide only estimates of health outcomes, we project that, over 20 y, 50% coverage with OAT could avert up to 22,000 (95% CI: 5,200, a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 OPEN ACCESS Citation: Bernard CL, Owens DK, Goldhaber- Fiebert JD, Brandeau ML (2017) Estimation of the cost-effectiveness of HIV prevention portfolios for people who inject drugs in the United States: A model-based analysis.

When coverage expansions are allowed to include combined investment with other programs and are compared to the next best intervention, the model projects that scaling OAT coverage up to 50%, then scaling NSP coverage to 50%, then scaling Test & Treat coverage to 50% can be cost-effective, with each coverage expansion having the potential to cost less than US$50,000 per QALY gained relative to the next best portfolio. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, 59% of portfolios prioritized the addition of OAT and 41% prioritized the addition of NSPs, while PrEP was not likely to be a priority nor a cost-effective addition.",
    "Our findings are intended to be illustrative, as data on achievable coverage are limited and, in practice, the expansion scenarios considered may exceed feasible levels. We assumed independence of interventions and constant returns to scale. Extensive sensitivity analyses allowed us to assess parameter sensitivity, but the use of a dynamic compartmental model limited the exploration of structural sensitivities.",
    "Conclusions We estimate that OAT, NSPs, and Test & Treat, implemented singly or in combination, have the potential to effectively and cost-effectively prevent HIV in US PWID. PrEP is not likely to be cost-effective in this population, based on the scenarios we evaluated.",
    "While local bud- gets or policy may constrain feasible coverage levels for the various interventions, our find- ings suggest that investments in combined prevention programs can substantially reduce HIV transmission and improve health outcomes among PWID. Author summary Why was this study done?",
    "* The US drug-injecting population is growing, with consequent deaths from opioid over- dose (30,000 deaths in 2014 alone) as well as increased HIV transmission.",
    "* Cost-effective HIV prevention programs for people who inject drugs are essential to the long-term health outcomes for this population and other high-risk groups in the US.",
    "* Our model-based analysis was designed to identify high-value portfolios of HIV preven- tion programs targeted to people who inject drugs in the US.",
    "What did the researchers do and find? *",
    "We adapted and extended a dynamic compartmental model that tracks multiple HIV risk groups in the US. PLOS Medicine | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002312 May 24, 2017 2 / 19 HIV prevention portfolios for US PWID * We projected the lifetime costs and benefits resulting from combinations of opioid ago- nist therapy, needle and syringe exchange programs, enhanced HIV screening and anti- retroviral therapy programs, and oral HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for people who inject drugs.",
    "* We estimated that opioid agonist therapy, which reduces injecting frequency and results in multiple, immediate quality-of-life improvements, can be cost-effective, while less expensive programs like needle and syringe exchange can provide additional value when used in combination. PrEP was not likely to be cost-effective in this population in most of the scenarios we evaluated.",
    "What do these findings mean? *",
    "Several prevention interventions--opioid agonist therapy, needle and syringe exchange programs, and enhanced HIV testing and treatment services--have the potential to pre- vent HIV transmission in PWID and improve health outcomes while meeting com- monly accepted thresholds for cost-effectiveness. Opioid agonist therapy may reduce HIV transmission and also improve quality of life for people who inject drugs; both effects contribute to its favorable cost-effectiveness. *",
    "Some prevention programs for people who inject drugs are controversial, and access is limited. We demonstrate that some of these programs can be both effective and cost- effective investments that have the potential to reduce not only the spread of HIV but also the size of the injecting population. Introduction Over the past decade, injection drug use, particularly heroin injection, has increased across most US demographic groups, making substance-abuse-related mortality and morbidity a public health crisis [1].",
    "In 2014, there were 47,055 deaths from drug overdose in the US, with almost 30,000 due to opioid overdose [2]. Because HIV spreads relatively efficiently through the transfer of blood in shared injecting equipment [3], people who inject drugs (PWID) account for a disproportionate share of HIV prevalence and incidence in the US [4,5].",
    "Although HIV prevalence and incidence among US PWID have been falling over the past decade [4,6,7], recent growth in the size of the injecting population has raised concerns that HIV risks could rise [8]. Programs targeted to PWID, which have the additional benefit of pre- venting downstream sexual transmission of HIV to others in the population, are therefore a public health priority.",
    "Given the current epidemic of injection drug use in the US, benefits that extend beyond HIV prevention are also a critical consideration [1,8]. A recent empirical study demonstrated that a combined prevention strategy effectively halted HIV epidemics in PWID populations [9].",
    "This strategy included opioid agonist therapy (OAT), which reduces injecting frequency [10,11], needle and syringe programs (NSPs), which reduce injection equipment sharing [12], and enhanced services for HIV testing and treatment (Test & Treat), which identify and virally suppress infected individuals by enrolling them in antiretroviral therapy (ART)",
    "[13,14]. Additionally, the US Centers for Disease Control PLOS Medicine | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002312 May 24, 2017 3 / 19 HIV prevention portfolios for US PWID and Prevention (CDC) now recommends daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which reduces uninfected individuals' risk of acquiring HIV, for PWID",
    "[15]. Although all of these programs have demonstrated efficacy, they have diverse delivery methods and target popula- tions, as well as different costs and anticipated benefits, and have not been modeled compara- tively in a cost-effectiveness context.",
    "The complexity of transmission dynamics and intervention scenarios makes it difficult to deduce a priori the highest value portfolio of prevention programs for PWID. To address this, we extended an empirically calibrated model of the US HIV epidemic",
    "[16] to assess the cost- effectiveness of alternative HIV prevention portfolios for US PWID. Each portfolio included some combination of OAT, NSPs, Test & Treat, and PrEP scaled to various coverage levels.",
    "Our model integrated clinical, epidemiologic, and economic data and captured the dynamic accrual of total population costs and benefits by tracking the spread of HIV through injection- based and sexual transmission routes. Methods Overview Our analysis builds on a previously published dynamic compartmental model of the US HIV epidemic",
    "[16]. A simplified schematic (Fig 1) illustrates how the model stratifies the adult pop- ulation aged 18-64 y by HIV infection and awareness status, CD4 count, ART status, OAT status, and risk group.",
    "We instantiated the model with US data (Table 1) and calibrated it to match a range of targets, including CDC estimates of US HIV prevalence [5,17-21] and inci- dence [4,21] across all risk groups.",
    "The model consists of a system of differential equations programmed in Matlab R2015b (MathWorks) that track compartment populations monthly from 2015 to 2035. We used a societal perspective to calculate the costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) associated with each Fig 1. Simplified model schematic.",
    "The simplified schematic shows model compartments for PWID not on OAT. A parallel compartment set exists for PWID on OAT, with flows between the two compartment sets, as well as 13 compartments each for men who have sex with men and low-risk populations, yielding a total of 70 active compartments in the model.

Costs and QALYs were measured over the lifetimes of all individuals active in the model over the 20-y time horizon and were discounted at 3% annually [22,23]. We also measured health outcomes such as HIV infections averted and change in HIV prevalence.",
    "Model structure and flows The majority of the modeled population is considered low-risk heterosexual. Consistent with CDC estimates, PWID and men who have sex with men (MSM) are smaller populations with higher initial HIV prevalence and HIV-related risk behaviors [5,21].",
    "Between 2015 and 2035, US birth cohorts age into the model when they turn 18 y, and individuals either age out of the actively injecting population at age 65 y or die (at age <65 y) at background mortality rates adjusted for risk behavior [31,48,55], HIV infection, and ART status [39,40,42,43,47]. Addi- tional Markov models follow individuals who mature out and those alive at the end of the 20-y analytic time horizon to capture all lifetime costs and benefits (S1 Appendix, Section 1). The model tracks incident infections, disease progression, HIV screening, enrollment in ART, and transitions into and out of OAT. Through calibration, the model reflects HIV infection risks given current OAT, NSP, Test & Treat, and PrEP coverage.",
    "We assume that PWID, when they do share injecting equipment, are equally likely to share with any other PWID [17,27,28,38,44].",
    "Injection-based HIV trans- mission depends on the infected partner's HIV stage [3,41] and ART status [13,14], along with the uninfected partner's use of PrEP [13]. Sexual mixing patterns approximate partnerships among and between risk groups, with transmission between sero-discordant partners addi- tionally depending on male condom use [18-20,27,29,38,56], condom effectiveness [57], and whether both partners are MSM [3].",
    "Upon infection, an individual enters a brief but highly infectious acute stage [3,41,58], fol- lowed by asymptomatic HIV (CD4 count 500 to 1,200 cells/mm3), symptomatic HIV (CD4 count >200 to <500 cells/mm3), and AIDS (CD4 count (cid:20) 200 cells/mm3) [25,41,47]. As CD4 count falls, infectivity increases [3,41,58] and quality of life decreases [44,59].",
    "ART moderates these effects, reducing injection-based transmission by 59% [13,44] and sexual transmission by 90% [14,41,44], and extends life expectancy by suppressing HIV viral load [40,42,43]. To be eli- gible for ART, an individual must first be diagnosed with HIV infection, at which time that person may also modify risk behaviors, such as injection equipment sharing or condom usage",
    "[18,27,29,38]. In the model, HIV detection rates depend on risk group and are higher in symp- tomatic HIV compartments [47].",
    "Although the model captures multiple risk groups in order to calibrate to the US HIV epi- demic, all interventions in this analysis are directed exclusively to PWID. Program scale-ups are incremental to the status quo, which assumes baseline 2015 levels of OAT, NSP, Test & Treat, and PrEP coverage.",
    "Scale-ups to low, medium, and high coverage levels were chosen to standardize comparisons and provide intuition for program costs, benefits, and interactions as coverage increases. In practice, feasible enrollment levels in terms of budget and participant retention are likely to vary by community.",
    "Opioid agonist therapy Methadone and buprenorphine are the most common pharmacological therapies prescribed as OAT in the US [10].",
    "We assume that OAT decreases the number of injections by 55% [10,11], thereby reducing overdose risk [27,31] and the chance of HIV transmission, and improving quality of life [27,28,32]. Additionally, we assume that individuals on OAT have higher HIV screening rates than the general PWID population and are more likely to connect PLOS Medicine | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002312 May 24, 2017 6 / 19 HIV prevention portfolios for US PWID to ART services if diagnosed [60,61]. OAT also provides the sole pathway by which individuals permanently cease drug use (3.6% annually) and move to a lower-risk population",
    "[28,30]. Pre- vious analyses of the costs and benefits of OAT have consistently found it to be cost-effective [28,62,63]. We assume that 25% of PWID receive OAT under the status quo [17,18,27-29].",
    "At low, medium, and high coverage levels, enrollment increases to 40%, 45%, and 50% of the PWID population, respectively. Such scale-up would involve both short-term investments (e.g., over- head costs for starting methadone clinics) and the long-term costs of delivering the therapies themselves [27,28,33]. In sensitivity analyses, we varied parameters affecting OAT's effective- ness and cost.",
    "Needle and syringe programs In the model, NSP broadly refers to any of a range of local programs, such as those at pharma- cies, hospitals, or designated facilities, through which PWID access sterile hypodermic inject- ing equipment [64]. We assume that NSPs reduce equipment sharing by 45% [12,34].",
    "Despite being considered a cost-effective HIV prevention strategy [35,65], social and political barriers often prevent NSP expansion [66], and it remains the most controversial of PWID-targeted interventions. We calibrated our analysis to the current effects of NSPs, which we assume to be minimal at a national level in the status quo [37,67].",
    "Low, medium, and high coverage levels expand NSPs to reach 40%, 45%, and 50% of PWID, respectively. We assume a fixed annual operating bud- get for NSPs, and low scale-up costs [35-37]. We varied the estimated costs and effectiveness of NSPs in sensitivity analyses.",
    "HIV testing and treatment US guidelines recently eliminated a CD4 count threshold for ART initiation and now recom- mend immediate ART following diagnosis [68]. US cities adopting this policy have used aggres- sive HIV testing, same-day treatment initiation, and routine follow-up to significantly increase overall viral suppression [69,70].",
    "Previous analyses of Test & Treat in the US have found favor- able cost-effectiveness ratios [44,47,71], and while PWID remain a difficult demographic to reach and sustain in care [70], other community-based interventions targeted exclusively to high-risk populations have demonstrated the potential for sustained case management for PWID",
    "[49]. Our status quo reflects current ART engagement levels [27,39,40], with risk group deter- mining the probability that a newly diagnosed individual becomes virally suppressed [40,72].",
    "At low, medium, and high coverage levels of Test & Treat, 40%, 45%, and 50% of infected PWID, respectively, enroll in sustained ART care by 2035. (Because an infection must occur before enrollment in Test & Treat, this intervention, unlike the others, cannot scale immedi- ately in the model.)",
    "Costs associated with Test & Treat include those of screening, diagnosis confirmation, counseling, and ART [44,47,48,50,51], as well as the associated costs of compre- hensive community-based care programs [49]. We varied the parameters determining enroll- ment probability (calibrated to additionally reflect the phenomenon of loss to follow-up), program costs, and participant quality-of-life benefits in sensitivity analyses.",
    "Pre-exposure prophylaxis Our previous analysis [16] found that PrEP, a daily oral pill of 300 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and 200 mg emtricitabine (Truvada), is most valuable for PWID when delivered per the CDC's clinical guidelines (e.g., HIV screening every 3 mo, toxicity monitoring every 6 mo) PLOS Medicine | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002312 May 24, 2017 7 / 19 HIV prevention portfolios for US PWID [15] and with prompt and sustained provision of ART for those who do become infected.",
    "Nonetheless, PrEP for PWID is expensive in terms of total budget outlay and ICER, although it could be considered cost-effective in the highest prevalence communities [16]. Our status quo assumes negligible PrEP use among PWID in 2015. At low, medium, and high coverage levels, 40%, 45%, and 50% of uninfected PWID, respectively, receive PrEP.",
    "The direct costs of PrEP reflect the costs of Truvada [48,53,54] as well as ongoing monitoring costs [48,51]. We assume that the PrEP enrollment process modestly increases HIV screening for the entire PWID population and that individuals diagnosed with HIV discontinue PrEP immediately [15].",
    "Economic model Each compartment is associated with an annual cost (adjusted for inflation to 2015 US dollars [73]) and QALY value depending on the characteristics of that subpopulation. A one-time scale-up cost is additionally associated with each intervention (S1 Appendix, Section 3).",
    "For every individual in the model, discounted costs and QALYs accrue at each time step, yielding a total cost and QALY estimate for each scenario. We also include lifetime costs and QALYs for individuals maturing out of the population and for individuals alive in the population at the end of the modeled time horizon (S1 Appendix, Section 1). We calculate ICERs by comparing the incremental discounted costs and QALYs for each scenario to the next best alternative [23].",
    "Model calibration We used a random search algorithm to repeatedly sample from estimated distributions for each model input and then empirically fit the model to US epidemiologic data, resulting in 182 calibrated parameter sets (S1 Appendix, Section 2) [74,75].",
    "Ranges on parameter values are presented in Table 1. We performed all analyses over the calibrated sets to incorporate param- eter uncertainty [76]. We present the averages over these sets as our base case results, with 95% confidence intervals where appropriate.",
    "Results Main analysis Table 2 compares the four prevention programs implemented singly. We estimate that expan- sions of OAT, NSPs, and Test & Treat up to coverage levels of 50% can cost less than US $30,000 per QALY gained relative to the next highest coverage level (95% confidence intervals for these programs fall below commonly accepted thresholds of cost-effectiveness, with NSPs having the widest range), while PrEP is likely to cost more than US$300,000 per QALY gained (95% confidence intervals fall above commonly accepted thresholds of cost-effectiveness). Our model estimates that achieving 50% coverage for OAT may avert fewer infections than achiev- ing 50% coverage for PrEP. Because we model nearly immediate direct decreases in mortality rates and increases in quality of life and HIV treatment for those enrolled in OAT, we estimate that expanded OAT coverage is likely to produce higher QALY gains than any other interven- tion, even when averting fewer infections.",
    "An underlying assumption in the model is that PWID must transition through OAT before being \"eligible\" to cease injection use. At low, medium, and high OAT coverage, respectively, we estimate that the actively injecting popula- tion could decrease by 23%, 31%, and 37% over 20 y, accounting for a substantial proportion of the quality-of-life gains.",
    "Relatively low delivery costs combined with these benefits have the potential to make OAT the most cost-effective choice among the singly implemented preven- tion programs.

Our findings presented in Figs 2 and 3 and Table 3 are largely insensitive to the majority of one-way sensitivity analyses conducted on model parameters relating to the implementation of each intervention. Several one-way sensitivity analyses conducted on program delivery parameters cause an intuitive interchange in the relative priority of interventions.",
    "For instance, at low NSP delivery costs or high efficacy of NSPs, or at high OAT delivery and start-up costs, our analysis suggests that the highest value portfolio would first increase NSP coverage before scaling up OAT. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA), 41% of sampled sets first add NSPs to the portfolio before adding OAT, while the rest add OAT first.",
    "We estimate that additions PLOS Medicine | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002312 May 24, 2017 11 / 19 HIV prevention portfolios for US PWID of OAT and NSPs to the portfolio cost less than US$50,000 per QALY gained in 100% and 74% of all samples considered in PSA, respectively. When the threshold is US$100,000 per QALY gained, NSPs are a cost-effective addition in 93% of PSA samples. We estimate that increasing Test & Treat coverage could cost less than US$50,000 per QALY gained over a range of delivery costs.",
    "We did not identify a one-way sensitivity scenario under which Test & Treat replaces OAT as the most favorable investment, although there are several scenarios in which, unlike in the base case, Test & Treat is a higher priority investment than NSPs. Furthermore, in PSA there were no sampled sets for which the model projected Test & Treat as the first addition to a highest value portfolio.",
    "The addition of Test & Treat costs less than US$50,000 per QALY gained in 4.7% of PSA samples, less than US$100,000 in 33% of samples, and less than US$150,000 in 67% of samples. Thus, in terms of cost-effective- ness, our findings indicate that a portfolio of prevention programs could achieve highest value by first investing in OAT or NSPs before scaling up Test & Treat.",
    "Over the majority of one-way sensitivity analyses, we estimate PrEP to cost more than US $500,000 per QALY gained when added to the portfolio. Only when we decrease PrEP's drug cost by 90% do we project its ICER value to fall below US$100,000 relative to the next best alternative. In PSA, when we vary both the cost and the efficacy of PrEP within estimated, cur- rently feasible ranges, 1% of sampled sets have a highest value portfolio for which the addition of PrEP costs less than US$150,000 per QALY gained.",
    "To further explore the dependence of our results on underlying calibrated parameters, such as ART efficacy, we performed all analyses on a limited subset, the sets containing a parameter value in the bottom or top 5% of all sets, for each parameter. Limiting the analysis to extreme values does not substantially change our findings, nor do other sensitivity analyses on the duration or implementation of interventions (S1 Appendix, Section 5.2).",
    "To probe the effects of wide confidence intervals on several parameters, we performed multiple joint sensitivity analyses outside the calibrated context as well as over three calibrated sets for which both OAT's effectiveness in reducing injection frequency and the decrease in injection equipment sharing following HIV diagnosis (with implications for the effectiveness of Test & Treat) were highly unfavorable (S1 Appendix, Section 5.3). We estimated that in such circumstances NSPs can replace OAT as the priority investment, but OAT, NSPs, and Test & Treat remain cost-effective additions to the portfolio, while PrEP is not likely to be, although its value can increase when other interventions are less favorable.",
    "Discussion The opioid epidemic is a global public health burden that has become particularly acute in the US [1,2,8]. In addition to the substantial mortality associated with substance abuse [2], high rates of HIV transmission among PWID make the successful prevention of HIV in this popu- lation a public health priority.",
    "To that end, we consider portfolios of HIV prevention programs that include OAT, NSPs, Test & Treat, and PrEP scaled to various coverage levels. Although model projections can only provide estimates of health benefits and costs, such analyses can provide intuition around critical mechanisms and assumptions to inform decision making. Our main finding is that, over 20 y, high coverage (enrollment of 50% of the eligible popula- tion) of OAT, NSPs, and Test & Treat in combination could avert nearly 43,400 (95% CI: 23,000, 74,000) HIV infections among PWID and reduce HIV prevalence among PWID by 27% (95% CI: 12%, 45%).",
    "The construction of such a portfolio has the potential to be cost- effective at each incremental expansion, with projected ICERs below US$50,000 per QALY gained. Moreover, our analysis suggests that the estimated benefit obtainable by PrEP alone PLOS Medicine | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002312 May 24, 2017 12 / 19 HIV prevention portfolios for US PWID (measured in QALYs) could potentially be achieved and even surpassed at substantially lower cost by combining other prevention interventions into high-value portfolios. Advocates for efficient investment in PWID-specific interventions have asked, \"What good is preventing HIV if we do not first save that life at HIV risk?\"",
    "[77]. Our analysis suggests that the high competing mortality risks of PWID can explain why interventions that immediately improve quality of life can have substantially higher estimated benefits than those that focus on HIV prevention alone. Our analysis estimates that OAT, in particular, which we assume has a direct impact on the length and quality of life of treated individuals [27,28,30-32,60,61], can provide substantially more benefit, measured in QALYs, than other interventions, even when it prevents fewer infections (Table 2).",
    "Although our analysis did not identify a scenario in which OAT was not a cost-effective addition to a high-value portfolio, deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses can provide intuition regarding scenarios in which NSPs could replace OAT as the priority invest- ment. Because the assumed delivery cost of NSPs is so much lower than that of other pro- grams, our findings suggest that it is reasonable to invest in NSPs concurrent with OAT scale- up. While Test & Treat is often estimated in our analysis to be a cost-effective addition to the portfolio, our model does not project it to be a priority investment.",
    "Our estimates for ART's reduction of transmission risk via injection-based contact [13,44] are lower than those for sex- ual contact",
    "[14,41,44], which may explain our projection of smaller benefits in the PWID pop- ulation. It should also be noted that HIV prevalence in US PWID is less than 10% [18], and the direct QALY increases from Test & Treat programs were therefore low relative to programs that served the entire PWID population. Costs and cost-effectiveness are but one factor among several in the decision to provide pre- vention interventions. Policymakers and clinicians may decide that considerations of ethics and social justice outweigh economic considerations for this vulnerable population.",
    "PrEP, for instance, can provide benefits for PWID and should not be denied on the basis of injection drug use. Moreover, our findings are based on the current cost of PrEP in the US. If the cost of PrEP were substantially reduced, its cost-effectiveness could become more favorable.",
    "Nonethe- less, as policymakers address the broader epidemic, our findings suggest that increasing the availability of a full spectrum of prevention interventions would have the highest health and economic benefits. Our analysis assumes that each intervention is an available option, which is not true in many settings. Treatment and prevention programs for PWID remain controversial, and interventions may be infeasible for reasons beyond budgetary impact.",
    "Despite evidence of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, a current ban in the US prevents federal funding for NSPs [67], and although a previous study found no significant correlation between neighborhood crime and treatment centers [78], proposals for new methadone clinics often face community opposition. Moreover, nearly 60% of individuals on methadone in the US receive insufficient dosing [79].",
    "For this reason, the model's calibrated sets reflected a wide range of possible effec- tiveness levels of methadone. If barriers to OAT access were lowered and treatment offered at international evidence-based standards, our analysis suggests that the value of this already cost-effective intervention could increase.",
    "Our analysis has several limitations (Table E in S1 Appendix). First, although our model captures dynamic interactions between programs, we implement combinations of programs as independent.",
    "This means that the efficacy and cost of each program does not depend on the efficacy, cost, and impact of other programs at the individual level (for a PWID enrolled in multiple programs) or the population level; that is, declining HIV incidence from an already implemented intervention does not change the delivery cost of another intervention. Rather, our parameters reflect average, aggregate effects in the targeted population.",
    "As policymakers PLOS Medicine | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002312 May 24, 2017 13 / 19 HIV prevention portfolios for US PWID move toward a \"one stop shop\" approach [66], there may be synergies between programs that we do not account for. At the same time, our analysis likely overestimates cost in such a situa- tion by counting the same overhead multiple times.",
    "PrEP's cost, however, comes primarily from the drug itself and is unlikely to decrease if combined with other services. As our analysis suggests that OAT, NSPs, and Test & Treat can be cost-effective even without combining over- head costs or incorporating synergies on an individual level, modeling programs as interde- pendent would likely not change our general ranking of programs, although it might increase value in an absolute sense if, for instance, adherence to any one program could be improved with multiple enrollment.",
    "Second, certain limitations are inherent to our choice of model. Although extensive sensi- tivity analysis allows us to investigate parameter sensitivity, the use of a dynamic compartmen- tal model prevents the exploration of structural sensitivities [80,81].",
    "Because compartmental models do not track individuals, we do not explicitly model such phenomena as loss to follow- up in HIV care, although we do calibrate linkage rates to account for long-term drop-offs in the care cascade [27,39,40]. Our model does not explicitly account for networks or distinguish risk on an individual basis.",
    "All of the interventions we consider would be more cost-effective if targeted to individuals central to injecting or sexual networks. Because an individual's decrease in needle sharing must also affect the number of shared needles of his or her injecting partners, the effects of NSPs, in particular, may be underestimated by a compartmental model, where we can only estimate average effectiveness for the individual accessing the service.",
    "However, as we find NSPs to be cost-effective under most circumstances, and as we find the most substan- tial benefit to come from direct, individual health gains accruing from OAT, independent of network effects, this simplification is not likely to alter our model's general findings. Third, we assume constant returns to scale (i.e., per person costs do not increase as coverage expands) even though, in practice, enrolling more marginalized PWID, especially at higher coverage levels, is likely more costly. While diminishing returns as coverage rises may decrease the value of investments in absolute terms, the relative ranking of programs, assuming that marginalized PWID are equally difficult to enroll in any program, would not be affected. Moreover, our framing of low, medium, and high coverage levels is meant to be illustrative of possible investment patterns, but our prioritization rankings and cost-effectiveness conclu- sions do not change with arbitrary definitions of \"high\" coverage (S1 Appendix, Section 5.2.3).",
    "In practice, achievable coverage levels may vary extensively by region. However, our cost-effi- cient frontier (Fig 2) suggests that OAT investments along a range of feasible coverage levels can provide high value, even when such levels are below 50%.",
    "Finally, many of our model parameters are uncertain. To address this uncertainty, we cali- brated our model to empirical data and conducted extensive sensitivity and uncertainty analy- ses (S1 Appendix, Section 5). Although these analyses suggest that our main findings are consistent across many scenarios and analyses, there remains uncertainty about HIV transmis- sion dynamics and the effectiveness of prevention programs when implemented jointly.",
    "Our findings should be interpreted in view of these limitations. Our model-based analysis builds intuition for the mechanisms behind the conclusions of Des Jarlais et al.",
    "[9], who found that a combined prevention approach was effective in ending HIV epidemics among PWID in a number of settings. We also project a range of scenarios under which these combined portfolios can be cost-effective.",
    "Where budgets are limited, our analysis suggests that a reasonable approach is for resources to be allocated first towards expanding OAT coverage, which we assume can have additional quality-of-life benefits for PWID beyond HIV prevention, including cessation of drug use. Combining NSP scale-up with OAT expansion, and investing remaining budget resources in further NSP expansion and in Test & Treat, has the potential to be both cost-effective and beneficial to the entire PLOS Medicine | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002312 May 24, 2017 14 / 19 HIV prevention portfolios for US PWID population.",
    "While budgets may dictate the extent to which programs can be scaled, we project that the relative ranking among modeled programs remains consistent across varied delivery contexts. Investment in cost-effective programs is critical given the current epidemic of injec- tion drug use in the US",
    "[1,8]. Although further empirical studies of combined prevention pro- grams would be very useful, model-based projections can inform the development of high- value HIV prevention portfolios.",
