    "Moderna vaccinees are older than Pfizer vaccinees and more likely to be White. These differences provide evidence on selection effects . Centrally for this project, for ages 60+, two- dose Pfizer vaccinees are substantially healthier (they have lower Non- Covid- NMR) than two -dose Moderna vaccinees, and three- dose Pfizer vaccinees are substantially healthier than three- dose Moderna vaccinees. The Pfizer vaccinees also have substantially higher CEMP levels. For younger two- dose vaccinees, age 18 - 59, selection effects are smaller.",
    "The Moderna vaccine is preferable to Pfizer for ages 60+, at least until one gets to a booster dose. Conversely, younge r persons are well protected by two- doses of either vaccine, and the lower Pfizer dose may have lower risk of side effects \u2013 in particular myocarditis, which is an important side effect for young men, with higher risk for Moderna than for Pfizer. Current U.S. public health messaging does not distinguish between vaccines, and promotes boosters for all. This guidance, our evidence suggests, is too crude. Also too crude is the apparent plan by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to recommend, and perhaps only allow, a single vaccine schedule for all vaccines and all ages.",

    "Conclusions The FDA has authorized, on an emergency ba - sis, the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. These two vaccines can provide protection from SARS-COV- 2 infection by formation of antibod - ies, to provide immunity against a SARS-COV-2 infection, with humoral as well as possibly cel - lular immunity, which has led to great hope for ending the COVID-19 pandemic. The available evidence supports the conclusion that both vac - cines are beneficial, but may cause some adverse effects including pain, redness or swelling at the site of vaccine shot, nausea, vomiting, fever, fa - tigue, headache, muscle pain, itching, chills, and joint pain, as well as in rare cases they may cause an anaphylactic reaction.

General Information: COVID-19 Vaccines Both the P \ufb01zer and Moderna vaccines are messenger ribo- nucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines. The mRNA-based vaccineshave advantages in that they do not generate infectious com- ponents or have the potential to cause infection, do not affect the genes or genome of the person or host cell, dogenerate a strong immune response with only one or twolow-doses of vaccine, and can be quickly produced in alarge-scale to treat mass populations ( Maruggi, Zhang, Li, Ulmer, & Yu, 2019 ;Wang, Kream, & Stefano, 2020 ).",

    "While certain developed nations are vaccinating their citizens free of charge, others are charging the public and must consider whether the vaccine is affordable by all the citizens, because the health and lives of all individuals of a society are equally important and universal vaccination is an excel - lent way to reach herd immunity. Special consid - eration must be taken by low-income countries where the average person can simply afford the vaccine or not, and if so, then cost would be a consideration. However, despite its lower cost, the Pfizer vaccine\u2019s major issue lies with its storage temperature between -80\u00baC and -60\u00baC (-112\u00baF to -76\u00baF)19, whereas the Moderna vaccine is stored at a relatively much higher temperature between -25\u00ba and -15\u00baC20 that is easier to maintain. This temperature requirement can pose a challenge to low-income countries, many of which also face an energy crisis, as to how they will manage such low storage temperature conditions to ensure the promising results of both the vaccines, especial - ly the Pfizer vaccine, with although cheaper, re - quires much lower and more difficult to maintain storage temperatures. Published data has shown that both vaccines elicit a similar humoral re - sponse, and the published literature reports no difference in cellular immunity.",

Findings of this paper show that other vaccines are awaiting clinical roll out for trials. Even thou gh these efficacies imply that the vaccines offer significant protection against the infection, further research and evaluation should go on to achieve higher efficacies while addressing any safety concerns that may go beyond local and systemic reactions t hat occur on patients after vaccination.

    "Page 6 Across these same frequencies, for 45-year-old women, 100% of simulations resulted in ratios higher than $100,000 per QALY for vaccination and screening compared to screening alone. Discussion There is great promise in the availability of accurate HPV diagnostics, new screening strategies, and a preventive vaccine against HPV-16 and HPV-18 for cervical cancer prevention in the U.S. Model-based decision analyses of how to best use these new options alone or synergistically can provide insight for policy deliberations and professional guidelines, as well as aid in identifying research priorities. Although previous analyses have evaluated the HPV vaccine in the context of current guidelines for catch-up programs up to age 26 (16,42,43), to our knowledge, our study is the first to assess the vaccine's routine use in an older population of U.S. women. Consistent with the general consensus that the value of HPV vaccination diminishes with increasing age of vaccination (16,43-45), we found that HPV vaccination provides nominal benefits in the context of current screening recommendations and practice among women in their 30s and 40s. Considering the lifetime risk of cervical cancer in the U.S. is less than 1% (1), the absolute risk reductions provided by HPV vaccination in this age group are quite low. Likewise, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios associated with adding vaccination to screening, given currently available information, exceeded $100,000 per QALY in most instances. These results were stable even when evaluating new, promising screening algorithms using HPV DNA testing with cytology triage, which is expected to have a higher positive predictive value than cytology testing alone post-vaccination (46).",

    "[77]. Our analysis suggests that the high competing mortality risks of PWID can explain why interventions that immediately improve quality of life can have substantially higher estimated benefits than those that focus on HIV prevention alone. Our analysis estimates that OAT, in particular, which we assume has a direct impact on the length and quality of life of treated individuals [27,28,30-32,60,61], can provide substantially more benefit, measured in QALYs, than other interventions, even when it prevents fewer infections (Table 2).",
    "Also, vaccine efficacy data using HPV infection and cervical disease endpoints are only available for five years and are only recently being presented for women in older age groups (59,60). In our analysis, we optimistically assumed that women up to age 45 were fully compliant to the three-dose vaccine series, and that those without prior exposure to vaccine- types received complete lifelong protection from the vaccine. Given these optimistic assumptions, our results could be considered a \"best-case scenario\"; to the extent that efficacy is lower or of shorter duration, cost-effectiveness ratios for vaccination strategies may be even less attractive than presented in the current study. This analysis did not consider the effects of reduced HPV transmission attributable to vaccination of older women, resulting in herd immunity benefits. We also did not include the vaccine's potential cross-protective effects against other high-risk HPV infections nor the benefits related to other HPV-associated conditions, such as other anogenital, oral, and oropharyngeal cancers; the natural histories of these conditions - and contribution of HPV-16,-18 - are far less certain, and vaccine efficacy data on these outcomes are limited.",

    "Previous cost-effectiveness studies that have included some or all of these factors have suggested that their inclusion does not offset the diminished efficacy among women of older ages (16,61). It is important to note that we did not incorporate the risks of adverse events or diminished quality of life from vaccination (e.g., side effects) or screening (e.g., overtreatment). Even though small risks of minor adverse events from either intervention will likely be outweighed by the overall average benefits at the population level, as data become available, studies should incorporate all risks and costs associated with a vaccination program. We also assumed that a woman's screening interval would not change post-vaccination; since a woman's particular history of vaccine-type HPV exposure - and therefore her level of vaccine protection - is unknowable with certainty in clinical practice, we assumed that extending a woman's screening interval without more information would be unjustifiable. Finally, this analysis is not relevant for women who have never been screened, who may comprise up to 5% of screen-eligible women in the U.S. (29-31). Both vaccination and screening will likely have beneficial effects in this population, but the magnitude of benefit from either approach will depend on important Ann Intern Med.",

    "The latter leads to an infodemic [16] of misleading information with immediate effects on public health, refusal, and vaccine hesitancy [9] for participation in clinical trials [17,18]. It should be noted that health misinformation is responsible for increased fear and lack of trust, which are major factors for enrollment also in cancer clinical trials [19-21].

    "HPV-16,-18 Vaccination and Screening Strategies, by Age and Screening Frequency When we comparatively assessed the health and economic outcomes of a range of cervical cancer prevention options facing \"today's older woman\" (i.e., different screening tests and frequencies, with and without vaccination), we found that most vaccination strategies were less efficient (i.e., strongly or weakly dominated) than strategies involving screening alone, or had cost-effectiveness ratios generally exceeding $100,000 per QALY (Table 2). For example, the cost-effectiveness of adding vaccination to annual screening for 35-year-old women ranged from nearly $200,000 per QALY (cytology with HPV triage over the lifetime) to over $400,000 per QALY (cytology with switch to combined testing). At 2- to 3-year screening intervals, vaccination strategies were either weakly dominated or exceeded $130,000 per QALY; ratios fell below $100,000 per QALY with less frequent screening.",

In the context of current U.S. screening patterns, in which women are screened with variable frequency, adding vaccination exceeded $125,000 per QALY irrespective of vaccination age or screening strategy. For all scenarios evaluated, the incremental cost-effectiveness of adding vaccination to screening was less attractive (i.e., had higher ratios) at older ages.",

Conversely there are many tests on the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (CLFS) for which the current level of reimbursement is not sufficient to cover the costs of performing the tests.

    "Vaccination involved the full three-dose series administered to women at the ages of 35, 40, or 45. In the base case analysis, we assumed 100% efficacy against HPV-16 and -18 over the lifetime among women without prior exposure to these specific types but explored the impact of lower efficacy and waning immunity in sensitivity analysis. Health benefits were expressed as reductions in lifetime risk of cervical cancer and gains in quality-adjusted life years (QALY), which reflect both morbidity (e.g., diminished quality of life due to cervical cancer) and mortality secondary to cervical cancer. Lifetime costs (in 2006 U.S. dollars) included direct medical costs associated with screening, diagnosis, and treatment (e.g., tests, procedures, hospitalizations) and with vaccination (e.g., three doses at $120 per dose, wastage, supplies and administration) (Table 1) (4,5,26-28,32-40).

    "Clinical efficacy and effectiveness vs. public health policy effectiveness and impact Traditional clinical trials evaluate efficacy and effectiveness of an intervention in a controlled setting, whereas implementation trials evaluate how to promote uptake and how to translate potential benefits into tangible improvements (9). Public health policy impact is a downstream consequence of the potential efficacy of the intervention as well as its real-world implementation (Figure 1). The Dynamic Sustainability Framework (DSF) (10) highlights the importance of adapting interventions on individual and systems levels to maintain and maximize longitudinal impacts in the setting of constantly changing evidence and contexts.",
