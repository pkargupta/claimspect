    "Moderna vaccinees are older than Pfizer vaccinees and more likely to be White. These differences provide evidence on selection effects . Centrally for this project, for ages 60+, two- dose Pfizer vaccinees are substantially healthier (they have lower Non- Covid- NMR) than two -dose Moderna vaccinees, and three- dose Pfizer vaccinees are substantially healthier than three- dose Moderna vaccinees. The Pfizer vaccinees also have substantially higher CEMP levels. For younger two- dose vaccinees, age 18 - 59, selection effects are smaller.",
    "The Moderna vaccine is preferable to Pfizer for ages 60+, at least until one gets to a booster dose. Conversely, younge r persons are well protected by two- doses of either vaccine, and the lower Pfizer dose may have lower risk of side effects \u2013 in particular myocarditis, which is an important side effect for young men, with higher risk for Moderna than for Pfizer. Current U.S. public health messaging does not distinguish between vaccines, and promotes boosters for all. This guidance, our evidence suggests, is too crude. Also too crude is the apparent plan by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to recommend, and perhaps only allow, a single vaccine schedule for all vaccines and all ages.",
    "The Pfizer vaccine is giv - en in two slightly smaller dosages of 30 \u03bcg14,15, whereas the Moderna vaccine is given in two 50 \u03bcg dosages16,17. The Pfizer vaccine is approved for ages 16 years up, whereas the Moderna vaccine is approved for ages 18 years and up. The efficacy reported for the Pfizer vaccine, at 95%14 is very slightly more than that reported for the Moderna vaccine at 94.5%16. However, differences between the two arise when their factors of cost, storage requirements, and beneficial or adverse effects are considered. The Pfizer vaccine is significantly less costly than the Moderna vaccine, and their costs are $19.50 USD and $32-37 USD, respectively18.",
    "Conclusions The FDA has authorized, on an emergency ba - sis, the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. These two vaccines can provide protection from SARS-COV- 2 infection by formation of antibod - ies, to provide immunity against a SARS-COV-2 infection, with humoral as well as possibly cel - lular immunity, which has led to great hope for ending the COVID-19 pandemic. The available evidence supports the conclusion that both vac - cines are beneficial, but may cause some adverse effects including pain, redness or swelling at the site of vaccine shot, nausea, vomiting, fever, fa - tigue, headache, muscle pain, itching, chills, and joint pain, as well as in rare cases they may cause an anaphylactic reaction. The occurrence of these adverse effects is reported to be lower with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine than with the Moderna vaccine. However, the Moderna vaccine com - pared to the Pfizer vaccine is easier to transport and store because it is less temperature sensitive.",
    "So far, both COVID-19 vaccines have their own pros and cons and appear to be effective. The incidence of adverse effects is reported to be lower with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine than with the Moderna vaccine; however, the Moderna vaccine compared to the Pfizer vaccine is easier to transport and store because it is less temperature sensitive. With fur - ther research, the science community will hope - fully bring forth new radical measures to fight this disease and finally bring an end to this pandemic.

    "Most importantly the Moderna, AstraZeneca/Oxford, and Pfizer/BioNtech vaccines seem effective and nearly equivalent in preventing serious disease due to COVID -19. Evidence, for the ability of the Sputnik V vaccine to prevent serious disease has yet to be published though it is effective in preventing infection . All four vaccines seem relatively safe with the greatest risk being anaphylaxis, though rare can be life threatening. Though these vaccines will more and likely be approved following the completion of their phase III cli nical trials one should consider a benefit cost analysis. Those at high risk such as those over the age of 60 or with moderate to severe chronic health problems should be the first to receive these vaccines.",
    "Thus, we conducted a rigorous analysis using the RCT CASP tools for the two RCTs, P \ufb01zer (Polack et al., 2020 ) and Moderna ( Baden et al., 2021 ), and the reporting of these RCTs using the Consolidated Standardsof Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist.

General Information: COVID-19 Vaccines Both the P \ufb01zer and Moderna vaccines are messenger ribo- nucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines. The mRNA-based vaccineshave advantages in that they do not generate infectious com- ponents or have the potential to cause infection, do not affect the genes or genome of the person or host cell, dogenerate a strong immune response with only one or twolow-doses of vaccine, and can be quickly produced in alarge-scale to treat mass populations ( Maruggi, Zhang, Li, Ulmer, & Yu, 2019 ;Wang, Kream, & Stefano, 2020 ).",

    "While certain developed nations are vaccinating their citizens free of charge, others are charging the public and must consider whether the vaccine is affordable by all the citizens, because the health and lives of all individuals of a society are equally important and universal vaccination is an excel - lent way to reach herd immunity. Special consid - eration must be taken by low-income countries where the average person can simply afford the vaccine or not, and if so, then cost would be a consideration. However, despite its lower cost, the Pfizer vaccine\u2019s major issue lies with its storage temperature between -80\u00baC and -60\u00baC (-112\u00baF to -76\u00baF)19, whereas the Moderna vaccine is stored at a relatively much higher temperature between -25\u00ba and -15\u00baC20 that is easier to maintain. This temperature requirement can pose a challenge to low-income countries, many of which also face an energy crisis, as to how they will manage such low storage temperature conditions to ensure the promising results of both the vaccines, especial - ly the Pfizer vaccine, with although cheaper, re - quires much lower and more difficult to maintain storage temperatures.

Using information that is available now, our results indicate that HPV vaccination of older women participating in the U.S. screening program provides much lower benefits than vaccination of pre-adolescent girls and does not provide good health value for the resources invested, compared with well-accepted health interventions in the U.S. It will be important to revisit this analysis as more information becomes available regarding the natural history of HPV and vaccine impact in older women.",
    "[42] Injectable PrEP keywords: [(Apretude) OR (cabotegravir) OR (inject AND prevent AND hiv) OR (inject AND protect AND hiv)] is PrEP,\" \"How Collecting Actively Obtained Information To assess actively obtained information, a systematic search of PrEP was conducted using 5 popular search engines (ie, Google, Yahoo, Bing, DuckDuckGo, and Ask) from April to June 2022. We simulated the behavior of general consumers using the following various search terms and phrases: \"PrEP,\" \"PrEP to use PrEP,\" information,\" \"What \"Pre-exposure Prophylaxis frequently asked questions,\" \"how does PrEP work in HIV prevention,\" \"PrEP brochure,\" \"PrEP facts,\" \"HIV and PrEP,\" \"Truvada PrEP,\" \"PrEP side effects,\" \"how much does PrEP cost,\" or \"how to take prep\" until a search result saturation was reached (ie, new information was not obtained). Then for comparison purposes, we specifically searched for \"medication guide,\" \"patient information,\" \"info for people,\" \"information for the patient,\" \"information for the user,\" and \"patient version\" of known PrEP medications, (eg, Truvada, Descovy, Apretude, Vocabria, and cabotegravir).",
    "Page 6 Across these same frequencies, for 45-year-old women, 100% of simulations resulted in ratios higher than $100,000 per QALY for vaccination and screening compared to screening alone. Discussion There is great promise in the availability of accurate HPV diagnostics, new screening strategies, and a preventive vaccine against HPV-16 and HPV-18 for cervical cancer prevention in the U.S. Model-based decision analyses of how to best use these new options alone or synergistically can provide insight for policy deliberations and professional guidelines, as well as aid in identifying research priorities. Although previous analyses have evaluated the HPV vaccine in the context of current guidelines for catch-up programs up to age 26 (16,42,43), to our knowledge, our study is the first to assess the vaccine's routine use in an older population of U.S. women. Consistent with the general consensus that the value of HPV vaccination diminishes with increasing age of vaccination (16,43-45), we found that HPV vaccination provides nominal benefits in the context of current screening recommendations and practice among women in their 30s and 40s. Considering the lifetime risk of cervical cancer in the U.S. is less than 1% (1), the absolute risk reductions provided by HPV vaccination in this age group are quite low. Likewise, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios associated with adding vaccination to screening, given currently available information, exceeded $100,000 per QALY in most instances. These results were stable even when evaluating new, promising screening algorithms using HPV DNA testing with cytology triage, which is expected to have a higher positive predictive value than cytology testing alone post-vaccination (46).",
    "Also, vaccine efficacy data using HPV infection and cervical disease endpoints are only available for five years and are only recently being presented for women in older age groups (59,60). In our analysis, we optimistically assumed that women up to age 45 were fully compliant to the three-dose vaccine series, and that those without prior exposure to vaccine- types received complete lifelong protection from the vaccine. Given these optimistic assumptions, our results could be considered a \"best-case scenario\"; to the extent that efficacy is lower or of shorter duration, cost-effectiveness ratios for vaccination strategies may be even less attractive than presented in the current study. This analysis did not consider the effects of reduced HPV transmission attributable to vaccination of older women, resulting in herd immunity benefits. We also did not include the vaccine's potential cross-protective effects against other high-risk HPV infections nor the benefits related to other HPV-associated conditions, such as other anogenital, oral, and oropharyngeal cancers; the natural histories of these conditions - and contribution of HPV-16,-18 - are far less certain, and vaccine efficacy data on these outcomes are limited.",
    "Variants emerging during a pandemic are of great concern because they can affect viral virulence, immunogenicity, and transmission, but also can impact diagnostic tests and vaccine effectiveness. For instance, 10,000 sequences deposited in GISAID (27) were used to assess that SARS-CoV-2 appears immune pressure,notbut indicating humoral selective pressure on the immunity imparts a significant virus (28). Genome sequences from all over the world being deposited in GISAID allowed Korber et al. (29) to show that the emergent variant leading to the amino acid change the coronavirus spike protein, which came to D614G of dominate SARS-CoV-2 sequences, is more transmissible. They went on to link clinical data to viral genome sequences and show that the increased transmissibility is likely due to increased viral shedding.",

    "HPV-16,-18 Vaccination and Screening Strategies, by Age and Screening Frequency When we comparatively assessed the health and economic outcomes of a range of cervical cancer prevention options facing \"today's older woman\" (i.e., different screening tests and frequencies, with and without vaccination), we found that most vaccination strategies were less efficient (i.e., strongly or weakly dominated) than strategies involving screening alone, or had cost-effectiveness ratios generally exceeding $100,000 per QALY (Table 2). For example, the cost-effectiveness of adding vaccination to annual screening for 35-year-old women ranged from nearly $200,000 per QALY (cytology with HPV triage over the lifetime) to over $400,000 per QALY (cytology with switch to combined testing). At 2- to 3-year screening intervals, vaccination strategies were either weakly dominated or exceeded $130,000 per QALY; ratios fell below $100,000 per QALY with less frequent screening.",

    "Page 2 Conclusions--Given currently available information, the effectiveness of HPV vaccination of screened women over age 30 appears, on average, to be small. Compared with current screening that uses sensitive HPV DNA testing, HPV vaccination in this older population is associated with cost- effectiveness ratios that are less attractive than well-accepted interventions in the U.S. Introduction Organized screening is widely credited with reducing the incidence of cervical cancer, and today, women in the United States face an average lifetime risk of 0.7% (1). With the availability of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing, clinical guidelines have been revised to provide several screening options including cytology screening at one- to three-year intervals with HPV DNA testing for triage of equivocal cytology results and HPV DNA testing in combination with cytology at two- to three-year intervals for women over the age of 30 (2- 4).",
    "Previous cost-effectiveness studies that have included some or all of these factors have suggested that their inclusion does not offset the diminished efficacy among women of older ages (16,61). It is important to note that we did not incorporate the risks of adverse events or diminished quality of life from vaccination (e.g., side effects) or screening (e.g., overtreatment). Even though small risks of minor adverse events from either intervention will likely be outweighed by the overall average benefits at the population level, as data become available, studies should incorporate all risks and costs associated with a vaccination program. We also assumed that a woman's screening interval would not change post-vaccination; since a woman's particular history of vaccine-type HPV exposure - and therefore her level of vaccine protection - is unknowable with certainty in clinical practice, we assumed that extending a woman's screening interval without more information would be unjustifiable. Finally, this analysis is not relevant for women who have never been screened, who may comprise up to 5% of screen-eligible women in the U.S. (29-31). Both vaccination and screening will likely have beneficial effects in this population, but the magnitude of benefit from either approach will depend on important Ann Intern Med.",

    "This study primarily aimed to design and develop a standard toolkit to increase positive attitudes and access to trustworthy information for better access and increased recruitment to vaccine trials for the public. More specifically, the produced tools are focused on inclusiveness and equity, and are targeting different population groups, including underserved ones, as potential volunteers for the VACCELERATE Volunteer Registry (older individuals, migrants, children, and adolescents). The promotional and educational material is aligned with the main objectives of the Volunteer Registry to increase public literacy and awareness regarding vaccine-related clinical research or trials and trial participation, including informed consent and legal issues, side effects, and frequently asked questions regarding vaccine trial design. Methods: Tools were developed per the aims and principles of the VACCELERATE project, focusing on trial inclusiveness and equity, and are adjusted to local country-wise requirements to improve public health communication. The produced tools are selected based on the cognitive theory, inclusiveness, and equity of differently aged and underrepresented groups, and standardized material from several official trustworthy sources (eg, COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access; the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control; the European Patients' Academy on Therapeutic Innovation; Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; and the World Health Organization).",

In particular, our results underscore the need for prompt action by public health authorities.",

    "Nevertheless, we are currently in the process of evaluating them for vaccine trials during this year by another expert group (WP4) of the VACCELERATE Consortium. Conclusions Communicating with trustworthy information to the public, related to public health issues and vaccine research or trials, constitutes the most important preventive strategy against infectious diseases and threats of future emerging infection diseases. Future initiatives could involve further improvement of the dissemination process for the developed tools in order to increase the number of volunteer registrations and in particular among population groups, which remain underrepresented in vaccine trials.",

    "The latter leads to an infodemic [16] of misleading information with immediate effects on public health, refusal, and vaccine hesitancy [9] for participation in clinical trials [17,18]. It should be noted that health misinformation is responsible for increased fear and lack of trust, which are major factors for enrollment also in cancer clinical trials [19-21]. Recently, Luis et al [22] reported that there is a lack of public information about COVID-19 vaccine trials among several population groups (eg, minorities and underrepresented populations or individuals), while the available tools for trial participation were also sparse."
