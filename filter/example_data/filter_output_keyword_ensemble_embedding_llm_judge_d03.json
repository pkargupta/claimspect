    "Moderna vaccinees are older than Pfizer vaccinees and more likely to be White. These differences provide evidence on selection effects . Centrally for this project, for ages 60+, two- dose Pfizer vaccinees are substantially healthier (they have lower Non- Covid- NMR) than two -dose Moderna vaccinees, and three- dose Pfizer vaccinees are substantially healthier than three- dose Moderna vaccinees. The Pfizer vaccinees also have substantially higher CEMP levels. For younger two- dose vaccinees, age 18 - 59, selection effects are smaller.",
    "The Moderna vaccine is preferable to Pfizer for ages 60+, at least until one gets to a booster dose. Conversely, younge r persons are well protected by two- doses of either vaccine, and the lower Pfizer dose may have lower risk of side effects \u2013 in particular myocarditis, which is an important side effect for young men, with higher risk for Moderna than for Pfizer. Current U.S. public health messaging does not distinguish between vaccines, and promotes boosters for all. This guidance, our evidence suggests, is too crude. Also too crude is the apparent plan by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to recommend, and perhaps only allow, a single vaccine schedule for all vaccines and all ages.",
    "So far, both COVID-19 vaccines have their own pros and cons and appear to be effective. The incidence of adverse effects is reported to be lower with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine than with the Moderna vaccine; however, the Moderna vaccine compared to the Pfizer vaccine is easier to transport and store because it is less temperature sensitive. With fur - ther research, the science community will hope - fully bring forth new radical measures to fight this disease and finally bring an end to this pandemic. Study Strengths and Limitations This is the first study in the literature, to our knowledge, to highlight a comparison between the biology, pharmacology, indications, contra - indications and adverse effects of the Pfizer/Bi - oNTech and Moderna vaccines for a better under - standing of these two vaccines.",
    "There is, howev - er, preliminary unpublished evidence that Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine may trigger stronger CD8 T-cell responses than Moderna\u2019s vaccine27. This cellular response might provide added protection against an infection. Regarding their adverse effects, both vaccines have in some cases produced serious adverse ef - fects, and in rare cases, have produced severe aller - gic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Despite these issues that concern the vaccines, to date, Pfizer and Moderna vaccine are the only widely available vaccinations in the fight against corona. Countries, despite cost, are trying their best to vaccinate their citizens as early as possible, but further research is required to ensure that potential adverse effects are not triggered by any COVID-19 vaccines28 and that planned phase 4 post marketing trials are also  S.A.

    "Comparative RMR of Pfizer vs. Moderna from Multivariate Logit Model Table shows odds ratio from logit estimation of COVID -19 mortality for samples of persons in Milwaukee County , aged 18 -59 or aged 60+, who died of natural causes and received 2 or 3 doses of Pfizer or Moderna over indicated periods. Odds ratios are for Pfizer vaccinee mortality relative to Moderna vaccinees (P/M ratio), from logit model of Prob(Covid- 19 Death) = f(received Pfizer (Moderna is baseline), with controls for age, age2, gender , and (days since last vaccine dose - 30 days) . Sample excludes immune -compromised persons and persons who received mixed Moderna and Pfizer doses. For NCNMR ratios, *, **, *** indicates p < .05, .01, and .001, respectively; significant results (at p < .05 or better) in boldface .",
    "The Pfizer vaccine is giv - en in two slightly smaller dosages of 30 \u03bcg14,15, whereas the Moderna vaccine is given in two 50 \u03bcg dosages16,17. The Pfizer vaccine is approved for ages 16 years up, whereas the Moderna vaccine is approved for ages 18 years and up. The efficacy reported for the Pfizer vaccine, at 95%14 is very slightly more than that reported for the Moderna vaccine at 94.5%16. However, differences between the two arise when their factors of cost, storage requirements, and beneficial or adverse effects are considered. The Pfizer vaccine is significantly less costly than the Moderna vaccine, and their costs are $19.50 USD and $32-37 USD, respectively18.",
    "Conclusions The FDA has authorized, on an emergency ba - sis, the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. These two vaccines can provide protection from SARS-COV- 2 infection by formation of antibod - ies, to provide immunity against a SARS-COV-2 infection, with humoral as well as possibly cel - lular immunity, which has led to great hope for ending the COVID-19 pandemic. The available evidence supports the conclusion that both vac - cines are beneficial, but may cause some adverse effects including pain, redness or swelling at the site of vaccine shot, nausea, vomiting, fever, fa - tigue, headache, muscle pain, itching, chills, and joint pain, as well as in rare cases they may cause an anaphylactic reaction. The occurrence of these adverse effects is reported to be lower with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine than with the Moderna vaccine. However, the Moderna vaccine com - pared to the Pfizer vaccine is easier to transport and store because it is less temperature sensitive.",
    "The authors have no competing interests. Corresponding author: Bernard Black, bblack@northwestern.edu. 1 Selection Effects and COVID -19 Mortality Risk After Pfizer vs. Moderna Vaccination: Evidence from Linked Mortality and Vaccination Records Introduction COVID- 19 vaccines have saved hundreds of thousands of lives in the United States (Steele 2022) and millions worldwide (Watson 2022) . Conventional wisdom is that both mRNA vaccines, from Pfizer- BioNTech (BNT162b2) and Moderna (mRNA1273) , provide strong and similar protection against severe disease and mortality , with perhaps a nod to Moderna, which wane s more slowly. However, these studies rely on observational data , and are vulnerable to selection effects for who gets vaccinated , with how many doses, and with which vaccine.",
    "The occurrence of adverse effects is reported to be lower in the Pfizer/Bi - oNTech vaccine compared to the Moderna vac - cine; however, the Moderna vaccine compared to the Pfizer vaccine is easier to transport and store because it is less temperature sensitive. CONCLUSIONS: The FDA has granted emer - gency use authorization for the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. These vac - cines can protect recipients from a SARS-CoV- 2 infection by formation of antibodies and provide immunity against a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both vaccines can cause various adverse effects, but these reactions are reported to be less frequent in the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine compared to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine; however, the Mod - erna vaccine compared to the Pfizer vaccine is easier to transport and store because it is less temperature sensitive.",

    "Most importantly the Moderna, AstraZeneca/Oxford, and Pfizer/BioNtech vaccines seem effective and nearly equivalent in preventing serious disease due to COVID -19. Evidence, for the ability of the Sputnik V vaccine to prevent serious disease has yet to be published though it is effective in preventing infection . All four vaccines seem relatively safe with the greatest risk being anaphylaxis, though rare can be life threatening. Though these vaccines will more and likely be approved following the completion of their phase III cli nical trials one should consider a benefit cost analysis. Those at high risk such as those over the age of 60 or with moderate to severe chronic health problems should be the first to receive these vaccines.",
    "Thus, we conducted a rigorous analysis using the RCT CASP tools for the two RCTs, P \ufb01zer (Polack et al., 2020 ) and Moderna ( Baden et al., 2021 ), and the reporting of these RCTs using the Consolidated Standardsof Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist. The authorspresent the \ufb01ndings from this analysis which revealed that both the P \ufb01zer and Moderna vaccine demonstrated safety and ef \ufb01cacy. The goals for this analysis are twofold: (1) enable health care providers to understand the methods and outcomes of these RCTs, and (2) enable health care pro- viders and community leaders to become champions for thevaccines to reduce vaccine hesitancy among all populations. General Information: COVID-19 Vaccines Both the P \ufb01zer and Moderna vaccines are messenger ribo- nucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines. The mRNA-based vaccineshave advantages in that they do not generate infectious com- ponents or have the potential to cause infection, do not affect the genes or genome of the person or host cell, dogenerate a strong immune response with only one or twolow-doses of vaccine, and can be quickly produced in alarge-scale to treat mass populations ( Maruggi, Zhang, Li, Ulmer, & Yu, 2019 ;Wang, Kream, & Stefano, 2020 ).",
    "Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines recorded a percentage efficacy of 95% and 94.1%. On the other hand, AstraZeneca and Sinovac vaccine recorded a percentage efficacy of 70.4% and 78 %, respectively. Although the COVID -19 vaccine is deployed based on immunogenicity data and safety measures, vaccine development aims to obtain evidence on vaccine efficacy in protecting individual s against SARS -CoV-2 infection [23]. Assessment for vaccine efficacy for COVID -19 is complex where a fundamental understanding o f pathogen evolving is crucial [23] .",
