    "Moderna vaccinees are older than Pfizer vaccinees and more likely to be White. These differences provide evidence on selection effects . Centrally for this project, for ages 60+, two- dose Pfizer vaccinees are substantially healthier (they have lower Non- Covid- NMR) than two -dose Moderna vaccinees, and three- dose Pfizer vaccinees are substantially healthier than three- dose Moderna vaccinees. The Pfizer vaccinees also have substantially higher CEMP levels. For younger two- dose vaccinees, age 18 - 59, selection effects are smaller.",
    "The Moderna vaccine is preferable to Pfizer for ages 60+, at least until one gets to a booster dose. Conversely, younge r persons are well protected by two- doses of either vaccine, and the lower Pfizer dose may have lower risk of side effects \u2013 in particular myocarditis, which is an important side effect for young men, with higher risk for Moderna than for Pfizer. Current U.S. public health messaging does not distinguish between vaccines, and promotes boosters for all. This guidance, our evidence suggests, is too crude. Also too crude is the apparent plan by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to recommend, and perhaps only allow, a single vaccine schedule for all vaccines and all ages.",
    "The Pfizer vaccine is giv - en in two slightly smaller dosages of 30 \u03bcg14,15, whereas the Moderna vaccine is given in two 50 \u03bcg dosages16,17. The Pfizer vaccine is approved for ages 16 years up, whereas the Moderna vaccine is approved for ages 18 years and up. The efficacy reported for the Pfizer vaccine, at 95%14 is very slightly more than that reported for the Moderna vaccine at 94.5%16. However, differences between the two arise when their factors of cost, storage requirements, and beneficial or adverse effects are considered. The Pfizer vaccine is significantly less costly than the Moderna vaccine, and their costs are $19.50 USD and $32-37 USD, respectively18.",
    "Conclusions The FDA has authorized, on an emergency ba - sis, the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. These two vaccines can provide protection from SARS-COV- 2 infection by formation of antibod - ies, to provide immunity against a SARS-COV-2 infection, with humoral as well as possibly cel - lular immunity, which has led to great hope for ending the COVID-19 pandemic. The available evidence supports the conclusion that both vac - cines are beneficial, but may cause some adverse effects including pain, redness or swelling at the site of vaccine shot, nausea, vomiting, fever, fa - tigue, headache, muscle pain, itching, chills, and joint pain, as well as in rare cases they may cause an anaphylactic reaction. The occurrence of these adverse effects is reported to be lower with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine than with the Moderna vaccine. However, the Moderna vaccine com - pared to the Pfizer vaccine is easier to transport and store because it is less temperature sensitive.",
    "So far, both COVID-19 vaccines have their own pros and cons and appear to be effective. The incidence of adverse effects is reported to be lower with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine than with the Moderna vaccine; however, the Moderna vaccine compared to the Pfizer vaccine is easier to transport and store because it is less temperature sensitive. With fur - ther research, the science community will hope - fully bring forth new radical measures to fight this disease and finally bring an end to this pandemic.

    "Most importantly the Moderna, AstraZeneca/Oxford, and Pfizer/BioNtech vaccines seem effective and nearly equivalent in preventing serious disease due to COVID -19. Evidence, for the ability of the Sputnik V vaccine to prevent serious disease has yet to be published though it is effective in preventing infection . All four vaccines seem relatively safe with the greatest risk being anaphylaxis, though rare can be life threatening. Though these vaccines will more and likely be approved following the completion of their phase III cli nical trials one should consider a benefit cost analysis. Those at high risk such as those over the age of 60 or with moderate to severe chronic health problems should be the first to receive these vaccines.",
    "Thus, we conducted a rigorous analysis using the RCT CASP tools for the two RCTs, P \ufb01zer (Polack et al., 2020 ) and Moderna ( Baden et al., 2021 ), and the reporting of these RCTs using the Consolidated Standardsof Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist.

General Information: COVID-19 Vaccines Both the P \ufb01zer and Moderna vaccines are messenger ribo- nucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines. The mRNA-based vaccineshave advantages in that they do not generate infectious com- ponents or have the potential to cause infection, do not affect the genes or genome of the person or host cell, dogenerate a strong immune response with only one or twolow-doses of vaccine, and can be quickly produced in alarge-scale to treat mass populations ( Maruggi, Zhang, Li, Ulmer, & Yu, 2019 ;Wang, Kream, & Stefano, 2020 ).",

    "While certain developed nations are vaccinating their citizens free of charge, others are charging the public and must consider whether the vaccine is affordable by all the citizens, because the health and lives of all individuals of a society are equally important and universal vaccination is an excel - lent way to reach herd immunity. Special consid - eration must be taken by low-income countries where the average person can simply afford the vaccine or not, and if so, then cost would be a consideration. However, despite its lower cost, the Pfizer vaccine\u2019s major issue lies with its storage temperature between -80\u00baC and -60\u00baC (-112\u00baF to -76\u00baF)19, whereas the Moderna vaccine is stored at a relatively much higher temperature between -25\u00ba and -15\u00baC20 that is easier to maintain. This temperature requirement can pose a challenge to low-income countries, many of which also face an energy crisis, as to how they will manage such low storage temperature conditions to ensure the promising results of both the vaccines, especial - ly the Pfizer vaccine, with although cheaper, re - quires much lower and more difficult to maintain storage temperatures.

Using information that is available now, our results indicate that HPV vaccination of older women participating in the U.S. screening program provides much lower benefits than vaccination of pre-adolescent girls and does not provide good health value for the resources invested, compared with well-accepted health interventions in the U.S. It will be important to revisit this analysis as more information becomes available regarding the natural history of HPV and vaccine impact in older women.",
    "[42] Injectable PrEP keywords: [(Apretude) OR (cabotegravir) OR (inject AND prevent AND hiv) OR (inject AND protect AND hiv)] is PrEP,\" \"How Collecting Actively Obtained Information To assess actively obtained information, a systematic search of PrEP was conducted using 5 popular search engines (ie, Google, Yahoo, Bing, DuckDuckGo, and Ask) from April to June 2022. We simulated the behavior of general consumers using the following various search terms and phrases: \"PrEP,\" \"PrEP to use PrEP,\" information,\" \"What \"Pre-exposure Prophylaxis frequently asked questions,\" \"how does PrEP work in HIV prevention,\" \"PrEP brochure,\" \"PrEP facts,\" \"HIV and PrEP,\" \"Truvada PrEP,\" \"PrEP side effects,\" \"how much does PrEP cost,\" or \"how to take prep\" until a search result saturation was reached (ie, new information was not obtained). Then for comparison purposes, we specifically searched for \"medication guide,\" \"patient information,\" \"info for people,\" \"information for the patient,\" \"information for the user,\" and \"patient version\" of known PrEP medications, (eg, Truvada, Descovy, Apretude, Vocabria, and cabotegravir).",
    "Page 6 Across these same frequencies, for 45-year-old women, 100% of simulations resulted in ratios higher than $100,000 per QALY for vaccination and screening compared to screening alone. Discussion There is great promise in the availability of accurate HPV diagnostics, new screening strategies, and a preventive vaccine against HPV-16 and HPV-18 for cervical cancer prevention in the U.S. Model-based decision analyses of how to best use these new options alone or synergistically can provide insight for policy deliberations and professional guidelines, as well as aid in identifying research priorities. Although previous analyses have evaluated the HPV vaccine in the context of current guidelines for catch-up programs up to age 26 (16,42,43), to our knowledge, our study is the first to assess the vaccine's routine use in an older population of U.S. women. Consistent with the general consensus that the value of HPV vaccination diminishes with increasing age of vaccination (16,43-45), we found that HPV vaccination provides nominal benefits in the context of current screening recommendations and practice among women in their 30s and 40s. Considering the lifetime risk of cervical cancer in the U.S. is less than 1% (1), the absolute risk reductions provided by HPV vaccination in this age group are quite low. Likewise, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios associated with adding vaccination to screening, given currently available information, exceeded $100,000 per QALY in most instances. These results were stable even when evaluating new, promising screening algorithms using HPV DNA testing with cytology triage, which is expected to have a higher positive predictive value than cytology testing alone post-vaccination (46).",
    "Also, vaccine efficacy data using HPV infection and cervical disease endpoints are only available for five years and are only recently being presented for women in older age groups (59,60). In our analysis, we optimistically assumed that women up to age 45 were fully compliant to the three-dose vaccine series, and that those without prior exposure to vaccine- types received complete lifelong protection from the vaccine. Given these optimistic assumptions, our results could be considered a \"best-case scenario\"; to the extent that efficacy is lower or of shorter duration, cost-effectiveness ratios for vaccination strategies may be even less attractive than presented in the current study. This analysis did not consider the effects of reduced HPV transmission attributable to vaccination of older women, resulting in herd immunity benefits. We also did not include the vaccine's potential cross-protective effects against other high-risk HPV infections nor the benefits related to other HPV-associated conditions, such as other anogenital, oral, and oropharyngeal cancers; the natural histories of these conditions - and contribution of HPV-16,-18 - are far less certain, and vaccine efficacy data on these outcomes are limited.",
    "Variants emerging during a pandemic are of great concern because they can affect viral virulence, immunogenicity, and transmission, but also can impact diagnostic tests and vaccine effectiveness. For instance, 10,000 sequences deposited in GISAID (27) were used to assess that SARS-CoV-2 appears immune pressure,notbut indicating humoral selective pressure on the immunity imparts a significant virus (28). Genome sequences from all over the world being deposited in GISAID allowed Korber et al. (29) to show that the emergent variant leading to the amino acid change the coronavirus spike protein, which came to D614G of dominate SARS-CoV-2 sequences, is more transmissible. They went on to link clinical data to viral genome sequences and show that the increased transmissibility is likely due to increased viral shedding.",

    "However, even before the drug was approved for clinical use, the first reports of antimicrobial resistance were described. Less than 20 years after initial approval, more than 80% of Staphylococcus aureus strains were penicillin-resistant (2). In the decades since, a similar story has been described for every antibiotic brought to market. Host-pathogen relationships are inherently dynamic: as hosts develop ways to combat an infectious diseases threat-- whether through immunity or treatment--pathogens evolve to evade our advancements.",

    "It should be noted that the provided educational material can be adopted to the user needs and may also be used as base-prototypes for further improvement and production of related tools. To ensure high rates of vaccination in populations [31] and a large number of participants in vaccine trials, it is necessary to ensure effective, targeted, and trustworthy educational and promotional tools regarding vaccines and vaccine trials, guaranteeing high diversity and inclusiveness in vaccine trials without underrepresentation of minorities. The developed standardized toolkit is one example of information from trustful sources that can be used against health misinformation and disinformation, lack of trust, fear, and fake news. Furthermore, it can be also used to increase literacy and understanding of the importance of vaccine clinical trials in the general population as part of an emergency preparedness plan. In addition, the promotional and educational material will be able to bridge the gap in public information (eg, communication approach, target audiences, and type of media produced) regarding COVID-19 vaccine trials, which is covered in only 2.51% of the collected media and only in 4 languages (English, French, German, and Czech)",
    "Limitations include uncertainty in the natural history of cervical disease, particularly in older women. As previously noted (58), whether an HPV infection detected at older ages is a newly- acquired infection or one that was acquired many years before and has re-emerged will influence the vaccine's impact in older women, but is subject to much uncertainty and debate. Our probabilistic analysis attempts to explore plausible scenarios of natural history uncertainties, while maintaining a good fit to data that are available from empirical studies.",

    "Vaccination involved the full three-dose series administered to women at the ages of 35, 40, or 45. In the base case analysis, we assumed 100% efficacy against HPV-16 and -18 over the lifetime among women without prior exposure to these specific types but explored the impact of lower efficacy and waning immunity in sensitivity analysis. Health benefits were expressed as reductions in lifetime risk of cervical cancer and gains in quality-adjusted life years (QALY), which reflect both morbidity (e.g., diminished quality of life due to cervical cancer) and mortality secondary to cervical cancer. Lifetime costs (in 2006 U.S. dollars) included direct medical costs associated with screening, diagnosis, and treatment (e.g., tests, procedures, hospitalizations) and with vaccination (e.g., three doses at $120 per dose, wastage, supplies and administration) (Table 1) (4,5,26-28,32-40). Direct non-medical costs, such as patient time and transportation, were included for all strategies.",
