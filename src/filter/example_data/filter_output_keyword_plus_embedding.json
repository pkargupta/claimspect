    "After Moderna published primary efficacy results of Phase 3 studies in late November, the FDA announced emergency use author - ization shortly thereafter.11,29 Mechanism of action The Pfizer and Moderna vaccine both use mRNA technology and are considered to have similar mechanisms of action.30 This mechanism is discussed on page 5. Efficacy The Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine is 94.1% effective at pro- tecting against symptomatic COVID-19 after administration of the second dose. The vaccine\u2019s efficacy in the age cohort of >65 appears to be slightly lower, at 86.4%. There were no significant differences in efficacy across ethnic and racial groups.",
    "So far, both COVID-19 vaccines have their own pros and cons and appear to be effective. The incidence of adverse effects is reported to be lower with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine than with the Moderna vaccine; however, the Moderna vaccine compared to the Pfizer vaccine is easier to transport and store because it is less temperature sensitive. With fur - ther research, the science community will hope - fully bring forth new radical measures to fight this disease and finally bring an end to this pandemic. Study Strengths and Limitations This is the first study in the literature, to our knowledge, to highlight a comparison between the biology, pharmacology, indications, contra - indications and adverse effects of the Pfizer/Bi - oNTech and Moderna vaccines for a better under - standing of these two vaccines.",
    "The Pfizer vaccine is giv - en in two slightly smaller dosages of 30 \u03bcg14,15, whereas the Moderna vaccine is given in two 50 \u03bcg dosages16,17. The Pfizer vaccine is approved for ages 16 years up, whereas the Moderna vaccine is approved for ages 18 years and up. The efficacy reported for the Pfizer vaccine, at 95%14 is very slightly more than that reported for the Moderna vaccine at 94.5%16. However, differences between the two arise when their factors of cost, storage requirements, and beneficial or adverse effects are considered. The Pfizer vaccine is significantly less costly than the Moderna vaccine, and their costs are $19.50 USD and $32-37 USD, respectively18.",
    "Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines recorded a percentage efficacy of 95% and 94.1%. On the other hand, AstraZeneca and Sinovac vaccine recorded a percentage efficacy of 70.4% and 78 %, respectively. Although the COVID -19 vaccine is deployed based on immunogenicity data and safety measures, vaccine development aims to obtain evidence on vaccine efficacy in protecting individual s against SARS -CoV-2 infection [23]. Assessment for vaccine efficacy for COVID -19 is complex where a fundamental understanding o f pathogen evolving is crucial [23] .",
    "Most importantly the Moderna, AstraZeneca/Oxford, and Pfizer/BioNtech vaccines seem effective and nearly equivalent in preventing serious disease due to COVID -19. Evidence, for the ability of the Sputnik V vaccine to prevent serious disease has yet to be published though it is effective in preventing infection . All four vaccines seem relatively safe with the greatest risk being anaphylaxis, though rare can be life threatening. Though these vaccines will more and likely be approved following the completion of their phase III cli nical trials one should consider a benefit cost analysis. Those at high risk such as those over the age of 60 or with moderate to severe chronic health problems should be the first to receive these vaccines.",

    "While certain developed nations are vaccinating their citizens free of charge, others are charging the public and must consider whether the vaccine is affordable by all the citizens, because the health and lives of all individuals of a society are equally important and universal vaccination is an excel - lent way to reach herd immunity. Special consid - eration must be taken by low-income countries where the average person can simply afford the vaccine or not, and if so, then cost would be a consideration. However, despite its lower cost, the Pfizer vaccine\u2019s major issue lies with its storage temperature between -80\u00baC and -60\u00baC (-112\u00baF to -76\u00baF)19, whereas the Moderna vaccine is stored at a relatively much higher temperature between -25\u00ba and -15\u00baC20 that is easier to maintain. This temperature requirement can pose a challenge to low-income countries, many of which also face an energy crisis, as to how they will manage such low storage temperature conditions to ensure the promising results of both the vaccines, especial - ly the Pfizer vaccine, with although cheaper, re - quires much lower and more difficult to maintain storage temperatures.

    "[16]. However, how the public health community in Australia have framed the NVP-related policy debate has not been systematically explored. In this study, we analyzed written submissions to and the transcripts of public hearings of the 2017 House of Representatives Inquiry from government health agencies, health charities, individual healthcare professionals (HCPs), public health academics, and organizations representing health and medical professionals (peak health bodies) with the following research questions: (1) What are the views of medical and health organizations, HCPs and public health academics regarding the safety and efficacy of NVPs?",

In contrast, of the submissions from government and peak health bodies, 20 (91%) recommended against relaxing current restrictions until more evidence on efficacy and long term safety is available. Only one peak health body, the RANZCP, endorsed NVPs as a tool for harm reduction.

Goldie, MD, MPH Harvard School of Public Health, Department of Health Policy and Management, Center for Health Decision Science, 718 Huntington Avenue, 2nd Floor, Boston, MA, 02115, USA Abstract Background--Women over the age of 30 are the main beneficiaries of improved cervical cancer screening with human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing. The role of vaccination against HPV types 16 and 18, recommended routinely in pre-adolescent girls, is unclear in this age group. Objective--To assess the health and economic outcomes of HPV vaccination in older women participating in the U.S. screening program.",
    "Interventions--HPV vaccination added to screening strategies that differ by test (cytology, HPV DNA testing), frequency, and start age, versus screening alone. Outcome Measures--Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (2006 U.S. dollars per quality- adjusted life year (QALY) gained). Results of Base-Case Analysis--In the context of annual or biennial screening, HPV vaccination of women ages 35-45 ranged from $116,950 to $272,350 per QALY using cytology with HPV DNA testing for triage of equivocal results, and from $193,690 to $381,590 per QALY using combination cytology and HPV DNA testing, depending on age and screening frequency. Results of Sensitivity Analysis--Probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed that the probability of HPV vaccination being cost-effective for women ages 35-45 was 0% when screening occurred annually or biennially, and <5% when screening occurred triennially, at thresholds considered good value for money. Limitations--Uncertainty in the natural history of disease and vaccine efficacy in older women. CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Jane J.

    "We adopted a societal perspective and discounted costs and benefits by 3% annually (41). After eliminating strategies that were more costly and less effective (i.e., strongly dominated) or less costly and less cost-effective (i.e., weakly dominated) than an alternative strategy, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated as the additional cost divided by the additional health benefit associated with one strategy compared to the next-less-costly strategy. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore how results were influenced by uncertainties, such as screening performance, vaccine efficacy and duration, and vaccine cost. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted using 50 good-fitting parameter sets.",
    "Less favorable assumptions regarding vaccine properties, such as efficacy and duration of protection, resulted in higher (i.e., less attractive) cost-effectiveness ratios for the vaccination strategies. For example, when efficacy was reduced to 70% among those without prior exposure to vaccine-types, cost- effectiveness ratios associated with HPV vaccination increased by roughly 50% across all ages and screening scenarios, exceeding $400,000 per QALY for 45-year-old women. Similarly, cost-effectiveness ratios exceeded $400,000 per QALY and $200,000 per QALY for all ages when vaccine protection waned completely after 5 years and 10 years, respectively. Results were modestly influenced by varying the cost of vaccination.",
    "Also, vaccine efficacy data using HPV infection and cervical disease endpoints are only available for five years and are only recently being presented for women in older age groups (59,60). In our analysis, we optimistically assumed that women up to age 45 were fully compliant to the three-dose vaccine series, and that those without prior exposure to vaccine- types received complete lifelong protection from the vaccine. Given these optimistic assumptions, our results could be considered a \"best-case scenario\"; to the extent that efficacy is lower or of shorter duration, cost-effectiveness ratios for vaccination strategies may be even less attractive than presented in the current study. This analysis did not consider the effects of reduced HPV transmission attributable to vaccination of older women, resulting in herd immunity benefits. We also did not include the vaccine's potential cross-protective effects against other high-risk HPV infections nor the benefits related to other HPV-associated conditions, such as other anogenital, oral, and oropharyngeal cancers; the natural histories of these conditions - and contribution of HPV-16,-18 - are far less certain, and vaccine efficacy data on these outcomes are limited.",
    "Previous cost-effectiveness studies that have included some or all of these factors have suggested that their inclusion does not offset the diminished efficacy among women of older ages (16,61). It is important to note that we did not incorporate the risks of adverse events or diminished quality of life from vaccination (e.g., side effects) or screening (e.g., overtreatment). Even though small risks of minor adverse events from either intervention will likely be outweighed by the overall average benefits at the population level, as data become available, studies should incorporate all risks and costs associated with a vaccination program. We also assumed that a woman's screening interval would not change post-vaccination; since a woman's particular history of vaccine-type HPV exposure - and therefore her level of vaccine protection - is unknowable with certainty in clinical practice, we assumed that extending a woman's screening interval without more information would be unjustifiable. Finally, this analysis is not relevant for women who have never been screened, who may comprise up to 5% of screen-eligible women in the U.S. (29-31). Both vaccination and screening will likely have beneficial effects in this population, but the magnitude of benefit from either approach will depend on important Ann Intern Med.",
    "Therefore, to encourage high-intensity activities in urban parks, it is particularly vital to ensure that there is a reasonable level of perceived safety together with appropriate service facilities. Greater attention should be paid to the perceived safety and accessibility of facilities for children, the selection of natural and artificial elements and materials, the color design of the site, and the impact of seasonal changes [55,56]. These results could provide a basis for implementing and evaluating environmental interventions to encourage higher levels of physical activity.",
    "However, such guidance should account for different population groups; should consider cultural relevance and the issues of accessibility, affordability, cooking skills and skills to make healthier choices when eating out; and should be based in com- mon eating habits, familiar foods and prevalent food preferences. The toolkit developed by Leslie et al.(6) is a good example of such guidance, while additionally addressing sustainability and encouraging home food preparation. Mithril et al.(7) offer a different approach by developing a regional prototype diet, the New Nordic Diet (NND), which is based largely on foods originating from the Nordic region and also takes palatability, health, food culture and the environment into consideration. In a third article on implementing dietary guidelines, Probst and Tapsell(8) find that, with careful food selection, meal plans with >4 grain-based servings daily can meet nutrient recommendations using lacto-ovo vegetarian and rice-based cuisines, although different strategies are required for different ages and genders.",
    "Results: This study presents the first set of harmonized promotional and educational materials and tools (ie, educational cards, educational and promotional videos, extended brochures, flyers, posters, and puzzles) for vaccine clinical research (eg, COVID-19 vaccines). These tools inform the public about possible benefits and disadvantages of trial participation and build confidence among participants about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and the health care system. This material has been translated into several languages and is intended to be freely and easily accessible to facilitate dissemination among VACCELERATE network participant countries and the European and global scientific, industrial, and public community. Conclusions: The produced material could help fill knowledge gaps of health care personnel, providing the appropriate future patient education for vaccine trials, and tackling vaccine hesitancy and parents' concerns for potential participation of children in vaccine trials.",
    "The latter leads to an infodemic [16] of misleading information with immediate effects on public health, refusal, and vaccine hesitancy [9] for participation in clinical trials [17,18]. It should be noted that health misinformation is responsible for increased fear and lack of trust, which are major factors for enrollment also in cancer clinical trials [19-21]. Recently, Luis et al [22] reported that there is a lack of public information about COVID-19 vaccine trials among several population groups (eg, minorities and underrepresented populations or individuals), while the available tools for trial participation were also sparse.",

    "Clinical efficacy and effectiveness vs. public health policy effectiveness and impact Traditional clinical trials evaluate efficacy and effectiveness of an intervention in a controlled setting, whereas implementation trials evaluate how to promote uptake and how to translate potential benefits into tangible improvements (9). Public health policy impact is a downstream consequence of the potential efficacy of the intervention as well as its real-world implementation (Figure 1). The Dynamic Sustainability Framework (DSF) (10) highlights the importance of adapting interventions on individual and systems levels to maintain and maximize longitudinal impacts in the setting of constantly changing evidence and contexts.",
    "Implementation outcomes Efficacy and effectiveness are the traditional measures for evaluating clinical and public health policies and interventions in controlled research studies. These measures focus on the absolute and relative differences in outcomes among exposed and unexposed groups and are generally conceived of as static estimates; in other words, the relative risk reduction associated with receipt of a particular medical intervention is assumed to be constant over time. Frontiers in Public Health frontiersin.org Branch-Elliman et al. 10.3389/fpubh.2023.1207679",
    "Implementation outcomes: the causal pathway to public health impact Importantly, while often not considered when evaluating clinical efficacy and effectiveness, implementation outcomes directly impact the expected benefit and impact of public health policies and their components (the individual interventions) (Figure 1). Interventions that are promising in laboratory settings or in idealized clinical trial settings have limited or no impact on public and population health if they are infeasible/unavailable, unacceptable, and/or perceived to be inappropriate by end-users. Further complicating longitudinal evaluations of public health impact and ongoing recommendations, these implementation outcomes themselves are not static - feasibility, which is related to availability (12), acceptability, appropriateness, and costs all vary according to contexts, evolving evidence, resource availability, progress, available alternatives and perceived benefits (Figures 2, 3).",
