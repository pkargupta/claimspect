     Top #1 Segment ([0.74627055]): many studies have reported real -world evidence on vaccine effectiveness (ve) for the mrna vaccines against infection, hospitalization, and death (for brevity, we cite principally systematic reviews).3-6 however, m any studies, including those sponsored by the u.s. centers for disease control (cdc). report results for both vaccines together.2,7-12 studies that report vaccine- specific results have generally suggested a modest advantage for moderna in effectiveness against hospitalization and death
     Top #2 Segment ([0.74593939]): (2022) report a moderna advantage in reducing hospitalization risk, and an apparent advantage for a combined icu-or-death outcome, but the small sample size "precluded statistically significant comparisons." [ 33] a study of czechia through november 2021 reports two-dose rmr, 7-8 months after vaccination, of 17% for pfizer vs. 12% for moderna (2022) [ 34]. the review by black and thaw (2022) reports a moderna advantage against mortality after waning (at least 120 days after vaccination) during the delta-dominant period, with midpoint rmr estimates from multiple studies of 13.3% for pfizer vs
     Top #3 Segment ([0.7454994]): 2 the pfizer and moderna covid-19 vaccines lack efficacy 2.1 what does the evidence show? pfizer and moderna persistently tout the 95% efficacy of their vaccines, based on the clinical trials that formed the basis of the emergency approvals granted by the fda [28, 29] and the european union [30, 31]. in pfizer's [32] and moderna's [33] more recent studies on adolescents, the claimed efficacy has been raised to no less than 100%. however, these claims cannot be taken at face value

     Top #1 Segment ([0.88063319]): the pfizer vaccine requires ultra-low temperature storage (-80 degc to -60 degc), while the moderna vaccine requires -30 degc storage. however, the last stage of distribution is quite challenging, especially for rural or suburban areas, where local towns, pharmacy chains and hospitals may not have the infrastructure required to store the vaccine at the required temperature. in addition, there is limited data available to address ancillary challenges of the distribution framework for both transportation and storage stages, including safety concerns due to human exposure to large amounts of co 2 from dry-ice sublimation, issues due to the pressure increase caused by dry-ice sublimation, and the potential issue caused by non-uniform cryogenic temperatures
     Top #2 Segment ([0.86891552]): the requirement of the ultracold temperatures for the storage and transport of the most advanced covid-19 mrna vaccines, especially the -70degc freezing condition required by the bnt162b2, is a major challenge towardsvaccine distribution and thus rapid mass immunization, particularly in climatic zones iva (i.e., 30degc/65% relative humidity) and ivb (i.e., 30degc/75% relative humidity) ( 98). these vaccines should be stored and transported in controlled environment to maintain their quality and potency. the storage and transport equipment (e.g., cold rooms, refriger-ators, freezers, cold boxes, and the thermal shippers designed by pfizer) are costly to acquire and should comply with the who standards
