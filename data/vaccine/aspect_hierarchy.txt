     Top #2 Segment ([0.53413161]): the pfizer vaccine is significantly less costly than the moderna vaccine, and their costs are $19.50 usd and $32-37 usd, respectively18. while certain developed nations are vaccinating their citizens free of charge, others are charging the public and must consider whether the vaccine is affordable by all the citizens, because the health and lives of all individuals of a society are equally important and universal vaccination is an excel - lent way to reach herd immunity. special consid - eration must be taken by low-income countries where the average person can simply afford the vaccine or not, and if so, then cost would be a consideration
     Top #3 Segment ([0.52030981]): moderna no, all clinically important outcomes were not considered asthis rct was of short duration because of the currentcovid-19 pandemic. other outcomes to consider are ef fi- cacy of single dose of vaccine, reduced or half doses of vac- cine, the extended interval between two-dose regimen (e.g.,>28 days between doses), and long-term-ef ficacy of the vaccine and whether booster doses will be needed in thefuture. however, these outcomes do not affect the decisionto proceed with the use of the vaccine to prevent morbidityand mortality in the population at this time, focusing on riskfor severe covid-19 such as age and health risk.question 11: are the benefits worth the harms and costs? pfizer yes, the bene fits of the vaccine are worth the cost of produc- tion and administration
