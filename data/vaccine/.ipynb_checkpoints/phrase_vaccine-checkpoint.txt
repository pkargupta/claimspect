accepted : july 05 , 2022  abstract purpose : the government of india has initiated the covid_19 vaccination drive from early january 2021 . vaccination is identified to be best option to protect the people across the globe . however , owing to fast wide spread of the covid_19 , the vaccine distribu tion is a major challenge owing various issues like temperature control , infrastructure , hesitancy , geographical diversity , and other cri tical factors . various research is carried out globally to understand and study the vaccine distribution issues based on the respective countr y issues and factors . research design , data , and methodology : this research paper attempts to explore prominent factors that could be taken up on priority for better and effective vaccination program . the study tries to rank various factors and sub_factors affecting vaccine distribution in india . ahp methodology based on feedback from 22 experts from the vaccine industry has been deployed to get the desired results . result : the results show that factors vaccine approval process , geographical prioritization , power supply , infrastructure maintenance costs for vaccine storage , and vaccine pricing are the prominent factors of effective vaccination in the country . conclusion : the role and need for district_level health officers towards vaccine storage has been brought forward . a long_term effective va ccination policy is needed for optimum vaccine distribution . keywords : vaccine , distribution , ahp , covid_19 , delivery jel classification code : i140 ,

the unprecedented rise of cases across the country has caught the country unaware , even though the first wave was controlled to a larger extent with stringent lockdown measures . the country ’ s gdp has been badly hit due to  1 first author and corresponding author , professor , school of business , university of petroleum and energy studies , dehradun , india . email : bangarraju @ gmail.com

. india is one of the countries that has been rated for putting the most stringent response towards the pandemic by closing international borders and by imposing nationwide lockdown . as a result , the economy was badly affected , stopping people from working and students from going schools and other institutions . manufacturing and logistics were one of the sectors that were affected mainly due to the demand and supply fluctuations . vaccines are one of the most effective health strategies for reducing infectious 4 vice_president , logistics and supply_chain management , dr reddys

effects while also improving the population ’ s quality of life . vaccines have cost_effectively improved human health over time by minimizing avoidable human pain , costs of care and treatment , and economic effects of work , such as reduced productivity and job loss . more and more illnesses , including major killers including pneumonia and diarrhea , are becoming vaccine_preventable , and the equipment used to do so is rapidly improving the present situation that has affected globally wherein healthcare professionals have tried and are still trying to bring in the most effective covid_19 vaccine . the covid_19 vaccine distribution is the most challenging task that the logistics and supply_chain sector has ever seen since world_war ii . therefore , the distribution should be planned even before the vaccine is authorized , as there will be complexities in the distribution of vaccines on a large scale . the various factors involved in the distribution should be identified and prioritized based on their importance for better planning and implementation . the vaccine production process has been accelerated in response to the pandemic . there are currently many vaccines that are authorized by most of the national regulatory authorities worldwide for public use . it includes vaccines from pfizer and biontech vaccine and moderna vaccine where both are rna vaccines ; covaxin , bbibp_ corv , coronavac , and covivac are conventional inactivated vaccines ; viral vector vaccines including sputnik v , oxford and astrazeneca vaccine , covaxin from bharat biotech india , convidicea , the johnson_&_johnson vaccine and peptide vaccine which is epivaccorona . there are many challenges faced over a for vaccine distribution and last mile delivery is a paramount factor ( sun , zhang , gehl , fricke , nawaz , gluesenkamp , shen , munk , hagerman , & lapsa , 2022 ) . the study relates to moderna and pfizer vaccine distribution at _300c to _700c of storage and transportation . the inadequate infrastructure for freezing temperature has led to vaccine waste and cost for vaccination drive . discrete choice methodology was deployed in usa to study the references for covid_19 vaccine distribution ( eshun , mody , tram , bradley , sheye , fox , thompson , & geng , 2021 ) . from various results of the study , waiting time for vaccination at health facilities was found to be less compared to other centres . vaccine hesitancy and community vaccination were factors which emerged as major ones . various models related to selective issues of distribution have been brought forward by authors in ( davahli , karwowski , & fiok , 2 021 ; de paula , costa , drumond , moreira , gomes , santos , & maeda , 2021 ; shukla , fressin , coetzer , & chaguturu , 2022 ) . an ahp model was used to collect public opinion towards various principles in global distribution of covid_19 vaccine distribution in united_states and germany ( klumpp , monfared , & vollmer , 2022 ) . however , the study was limited to principles such as medical emergency , free market , equal access and production . keeping in view the indian scenario , the main concern is how to distribute the vaccines equally among the citizens of any country worldwide , especially in a country like india with a huge population . the research paper tries to unearth the prominent factors and ranks that affect vaccine distribution and last_mile delivery in india using ahp model . section 1 introduction deals with the need for effective vaccination and logistics distribution research . section 2 discusses a literature review of various factors and sub_factors studied for previous vaccines and by the world_health_organization . the section also establishes the research gap in vaccine distribution . the third and fourth sections address the research methodology of ahp and the analysis of various factors and sub_factors , respectively . section 5 deliberates the conclusion which consists of various sub_ factors which need to be resolved for effective vaccination . 2 . literature review there are various factors affecting the of distribution vaccines , the authors have identified them from existing literature related to other vaccine distributions . these have been divided into five major categories namely economic factors ( ecf ) , operation factors ( opf ) , administrative factors ( amf ) , and geopolitical factors ( gpf ) . 2.1 . economic factors infrastructure maintenance cost ( ecf1 ) is one of the first economic factors brought forward in the papers . since cold_storage is essential , the costs for maintenance have been the major factors identified . vaccine price ( ecf2 ) is the second subfactor as discussed in the papers ( jadhav , gautam , & gairola , 2014 ; robbins & lunday , 2016 ) . the major infrastructural factor to support distribution keeping in view the cold stage and refrigeration is the uninterrupted power supply ( ecf3 ) which has been discussed in ( bogale , amhare , & bogale , 2019 ) . vaccine wastage ( ecf4 ) is a major factor that leads rise in demand and thereby increases in obtaining cost . the studies regarding this sub_factor have been discussed by authors in ( das , sood , tambe , sharma , parande , surwade , salunke , patil , pawar , guleri , kaushal , & sindhu , 2020 ; guichard , hymbaugh , burkholder , diorditsa , navarro , ahmed , & rahman , 2010 ) . interestingly , the said studies have been done in india and bangladesh for vaccination programs . the fifth important sub_factor is the quality of equipment ( ecf5 ) which has been discussed in ( lahariya , 2014 ) . 2.2 . operational factors operational factors include various physical distribution totakura bangar raju , deepankar chakrabarti , neenu das , ravi prakash mathur / journal of distribution science 20_7 ( 2022 ) 57_64 59 and supply_chain management_related issues . the foremost sub_factors in the category are storage infrastructure ( opf1 ) , cold_chain temperature ( opf2 ) , and temperature monitoring mechanism ( opf3 ) which have been examined in ( chojnacky , santacruz , miller , & strouse , 2015 ; falcón , porras , altamirano , & kartoglu , 2020 ; haidari , connor , wateska , brown , mueller , norman , schmitz , paul , rajgopal , welling , leonard , chen , & lee , 2013 ; long & hayney , 2013 ) . the said sub_factors are perceived to be major challenges in the present scenario of emergency and widespread pandemics . the said sub_factors are also important keeping in view various vaccine candidates being developed , are to be stored and transported between _70c to 8c depending on the type of vaccine . a review of various studies related to freezing temperatures has been detailed by authors ( matthias , robertson , garrison , newland , & nelson 2007 ) . the cold_storage temperature has been identified to be critical for various vaccines for children . transport network ( opf4 ) which is an important feature for logistics has been examined ( adida , dey , & mamani , 2013 ; lin , zhao , & lev , 2020 ) . uncertainties in consumption and production are the major issues for the transport networks and decision_making . vaccine order quantity ( opf5 ) has , and economic order quantity and minimum order quantity affect the costs , manufacturing , and logistics in the distribution . the vaccine inventory ( ofc6 ) is the next sub_ factor that is essential to be maintained at health/vaccination centers that have been examined ( iwu , ngcobo , mccaul , mangqalaza , magwaca , chikte , & wiysonge , 2020 ) . packaging ( ofc7 ) is an essential sub_factor keeping in view the cold_chain distribution of vaccines ( norman , rajgopal , lim , gorham , haidari , brown , & lee 2015 ) . the sub_factors opf5 , opf6 , and opf7 are critical in most cold_chain logistics and distribution , and they have been found to be prominent in vaccine distribution too . 2.3 . administrative factors the border process ( amf1 ) which involves cross_ border cooperation and customs clearance has been identified by authors in ( wang , zhang , yu , wen , yan , tang , zhang , fan , reilly , xu , li , ding , & luo , 2015 ) . the regulatory system ( amf2 ) is the foremost sub_factor where the administration of the respective country and who have expectations . conflicts in many countries having religious , socio_economic diversities and civil unrest have been a major issue in vaccination . in such situations , sub_factor security ( amf3 ) is an essential concern ( hussain , boyle , patel , & sullivan , 2016 ) . effective control of counterfeit mechanism ( amf4 ) is quite rampant in countries with weak administration mechanisms when there is a surge in demand . the last sub_factor is the vaccine approval process ( amf5 ) which is a quiet complex in nature and vital for starting the vaccine distribution ( pickering , meissner , orenstein , and cohn , 2020 ) . 2.4 . geopolitical factors access ( gpf1 ) is a vital sub_factor which are guided by political intervention and will . access is dependent on income levels , political factors , and region ( mihigo , okeibunor , cernuschi , petu , satoulou , & zawaira , 2019 ) . most of the countries have geographical diversifications based on topography , demographic conditions and need for effective geographical prioritization ( gpf2 ) decision model is needed catering to various segments ( otieno , nyawanda , audi , emukule , lebo , bigogo , ochola , muthoka , widdowson , shay , burton , breiman , katz , & mott , 2014 ; yarmand , ivy , denton , & lloyd , 2014 ) . the authors ( berkley , 2019 ; shakeel , brown , sethi , & mackey , 2019 ) have bought forward political will ( gpf3 ) for effective vaccination . vaccine hesitancy and awareness ( gpf4 ) is a major issue for early vaccination in many countries due to misbeliefs as in discussed many studies examined by authors in ( xiao , cheung , wu , ni , cowling , & liao , 2022 ) . vaccine policy ( gpf5 ) of any country in developing , importing and effective distribution is a key driver . vaccine policy with well_defined objectives and the respective country ’ s vaccine program defines outcomes for effective vaccination ( epling , 2020 ; yamin , & gavious , 2013 ) . 2.5 . research gap a pandemic of this nature is unprecedented . one of the ways to arrest the spread of the coronavirus is to have a rapid vaccination drive that may facilitate building herd_immunity amongst the citizens . it may sound easy , but the challenges on ground zero are many , particularly in a diverse country like india . vaccination drive of this colossal magnitude has never been carried out before and nations including india are grappling through a steep learning_curve to speed up the process . earlier research ( lemmens , decouttere , vandale , & bernuzzi , 2016 ) around distribution and supply_chain models have been developed for vaccines but were restricted to small popu lations and geographical spreads . earlier literature as discussed above has identified several factors such as economic factors ( ecf ) , operation factors ( opf ) , administrative factors ( amf ) , and geopolitical factors ( gpf ) for effective vaccine distribution in different contexts . the supply_chain models and factors for vaccine distribution are known to an extent from literature , but the current context is very different and difficult . there is a need to test and apply the known knowledge to this current covid_19 context to support the vaccination drive and build academic understanding around effective vaccine distribution in pandemic situations like these . this study tries to evaluate and prioritize the vaccine distribution factors in a context of a developing nation like india . 60 evaluation of factors for effective distribution of covid_19 vaccines specifically , the research addresses the following questions : 1 . which of the vaccine distribution factors and their sub_factors from the existing literature need prioritization at the implementation stage to speed up vaccination for the citizens ? 2 . which of the factors and their sub_factors as prioritized acts as enablers and barriers to the vaccination drive ? the outcome of this research would enable the government and other stakeholders to work on prominent factors and barriers , thereby designing an efficient supply_chain system . 3 . research methods the objective of the research paper is to identify critical factors for the effective distribution of covid_19 vaccines in india . the various main factors and sub_factors have been identified through the literature review . since covid_19 is a new virus and there is an absence of sufficient study about its distribution in other countries , factors were identified from studies related to other existing vaccines in the market . analytical_hierarchy process ( ahp ) which is a well know method of multi_criteria decision making ( mcdm ) has been used for the analysis . a questionnaire has been circulated to 22 various professionals in existing vaccine distribution in india to measure the relative weights for the identified factors . the ahp has been used in many research articles ( asgari , hassani , jones , & nguye , 2015 ; gaudenzi & borghesi , 2006 ) which bring forth the prioritization for alternatives based on the criteria . figure 1 : ahp model the various strides involved in the ahp process are ( sengar , garg , & raju , 2018 ) 1 . define and understand the research problem . the research problem in this paper is to distinguish various factors for vaccine distribution and to frame a hierarchy model . 2 . design a questionnaire and make pair_wise comparisons from professionals working in various vaccine supply_chains and distribution . 3 . analysing the normalized weighs for sub_factors factors affecting the vaccine distribution . ranking and criteria are made based on weighs . 4 . the consistency ratio ( cr ) which is used to evaluate the reliability and consistency of the group is determined for pair_wise comparisons consistency . the cr is calculated by the formula cr= ci/ri . ri is the random index and ci is the consistency index shown in table 5 . the ci needs to be less than 0.10 as a thumb rule else values need to be recalculated until the desired results are obtained . table 1 : pairwise comparison scale strength of significance definition 1 equally significant 3 moderately significant 5 strongly significant 7 very strongly

shown in table 9 , which were identified and evaluated using the mcdm technique . the table shows that the distribution of vaccines in the indian scenario can be assessed in terms of the operational , economic , administrative , and geopolitical factors . the study ranks these dimensions in the order of importance : operational , economic , administrative , and geopolitical factors . the operational factors were ranked the most important when compared to all the other three factors as per the survey conducted and it weighs the most of all the factors as shown in table 4 . putting the operational factors foremost will help the government plan for a cost_effective distribution of vaccines by maintaining the factors that can lead to vaccine wastage and unnecessary costs . especially in the current condition that our government is put in to provide vaccines to each and everyone in the country free of cost and to make sure that it reaches to the last one . so operational factors should be considered first . next comes the economic factors with the second rank , the factors that will support carrying out the operational factors . administrative factors rank the third and geopolitical ranks the fourth where both are interdependent . the subfactors of each of these dimensions are also ranked in table 9 . of all the subfactors license approval process ranks always first , once the vaccine is ready it goes for the license approval and in the present case of the covid_19 vaccine it is the emergency use listing procedure . the rankings of the factors are determined by multiplying the sub factor ’ s relative weights ( 0.285567 ) with its respective dimension ’ s weight ( 0.248022 ) , giving it a global relative weight of 0.0653295 making amf5 rank 1 . geographical prioritization ( gpf2 ) of how and where to supply the vaccines first on availability comes the second most important factor which is categorized under geopolitical factors . indian topography consists of plains , deserts , and himalayan mountains are quite diversified . a continuous power supply is a must when it comes to the storage of vaccines as it requires temperature control which is categorized as an economic factor . therefore , the uninterrupted power supply ranks 3 . infrastructure maintenance cost ( ecf1 ) , quality of equipment ( ecf5 ) , vaccine price ( ecf2 ) comes under economic factors that rank 4 , 5 , and 6 respectively . access to the vaccines to all the citizens without any discrimination on gender , religion , caste is one of the factors that should be noticed in order to stop the further spread and improve the present conditions . access is categorized under geopolitical factors as gpf1 and ranks 7 . once access is also prioritized , the quantity of vaccines that is required for the country comes next . order quantity that is categorized under operational factor as opf5 ranks 8 . after the order quantity processing the order is the next step , which is categorized as administrative factors as amf1 , ranks 9 . transport network ( opf4 ) , storage infrastructure ( opf1 ) , cold_chain temperature ( opf2 ) , inventory ( opf6 ) , temperature monitoring mechanism ( opf3 ) ranks 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 that comes under operational factors as shown in table 10 . policies ( gpf5 ) involved in the vaccine distribution ranks 15 which is a geopolitical factor . packaging ( opf7 ) of the vaccines is important to avoid vaccine wastage , which ranks 16 . political will ( gpf3 ) depends on the political condition of the area , regulatory system ( amf2 ) , hesitancy and awareness ( gpf4 ) , counterfeit control mechanism ( amf4 ) , vaccine wastage ( ecf4 ) ranks 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , and 21 . amf 3 is ranked the last which is security as the vaccines are of utmost importance for the government is giving more importance than any other programs going on in order to bring back the economy . 5 . conclusions widespread vaccination would almost certainly be needed to end the covid_19 pandemic . to ensure that every subsequent allocation strategy advances the expected public health goals for covid_19 vaccination : namely , to mitigate morbidity and mortality loss , avoid economic damage from the pandemic , and narrow unfair health disparities , strategic preparation for the ethical distribution of vaccines against covid_19 is essential . to ensure that the vaccine can be used worldwide , rigorous production and distribution policies and protocols will be required . india lacks effective policies for healthcare rationing , as well as the required discussions in academia . infectious_diseases pose a global challenge to public health , and vaccines provide a secure and effective remedy . the cost of transporting vaccines can be reduced by optimizing the vaccine supply path , lowering the total cost . the optimization and management of the vaccine supply_chain is currently a hot_topic of study . the cold stage infrastructure of the country has always been challenging for perishable goods including health care supplies . capacity and totakura bangar raju , deepankar chakrabarti , neenu das , ravi prakash mathur / journal of distribution science 20_7 ( 2022 ) 57_64 63 maintenance have been major issues facing the perishables distribution . the experts at the district level and state_level are required to identify adequate cold_storage requirements based on vaccine centers . sustainable and affordable models of storage units are required at district levels . the vaccine cold_chain management is strongly associated with health care workers ’ profession and knowledge of handling the same . the vaccine pricing in the country has been under criticism . this is due to differential pricing allowed under procurement by state and central governments . the vaccine manufacturers have been allowed to sell at a lower price to central governments contracts whereas state and private bodies purchase contracts have allowed for higher prices respectively . this has led to greater chaos and mismanagement of purchases and inventory controls . of late , the central government has reviewed that the whole procurement would be taken by themselves under a single price and has a fixed upper limit for private players . this is showing better results in supply and effective vaccination drive . training and educating the health workers for the appropriate handling of vaccine cold_chain logistics is the immediate need of the hour . this could also lead to reduced vaccine wastage . this is one of the factors for denying permission to pfizer vaccine usage in india as this requires storage at _70o c. there is a need for a more advanced and optimized system that can meet the growing demand for vaccines while also resolving issues that previous systems could not . the covid_19 pandemic has focused all policymakers ’ attention on one long_term goal : the ability to effectively navigate the next global_health crisis . this will necessitate a medical equipment supply_chain that is both resilient and adaptable . governments ' ability to define and execute both pre_planned and ad_hoc steps , forge organizational alliances , sustain supply and logistics infrastructure , gain real_time visibility along the supply_chain , and create a core response unit empowered to respond quickly and effectively will all be critical to their success . in the context of the indian situation , the factors evaluated and confirmed in the current study can be useful in developing a system , as the study evaluates and confirms the relative importance of factors that may affect vaccine distribution . from this study , policymakers , supply_chain partners , public_private partnerships , government_to_government partnerships , or any organization related to distribution vaccines should benefit from this study by prioritizing the factors for efficient and effective distribution of vaccines . limitations and scope of the study : the study has been limited to vaccine distribution in india only . however , a similar method could be deployed to study in other countries for more effective vaccine distribution . references adida , e. , dey , d. , & mamani , h.

95 % conﬁdence interval [ ci ] = 91 % –95 % ) than for the pﬁzer_biontech vaccine ( 88 % ; 95 % ci = 85 % –91 % ) ( p = 0.011 ) ; ve for both mrna vaccines was higher than that for the janssen vaccine ( 71 % ; 95 % ci = 56 % –81 % ) ( all p < 0.001 ) . protection for the pﬁzer_biontech vaccine declined 4 months after vaccination . postvaccination anti_spike igg and anti_rbd igg levels were signiﬁcantly lower in persons vaccinated with the janssen vaccine than the moderna or pﬁzer_biontech vaccines . although these real_world data suggest some variation in levels of protection by vaccine , all fda_approved or authorized covid_19 vaccines provide substantial protection against covid_19 hospitalization . for the ve analysis , adults aged_≥18 years without an immunocompromising condition admitted to 21 hospitals within the inﬂuenza and other viruses in the acutely ill ( ivy ) network were prospectively recruited for a case_control analysis ( 6,7 ) . case_patients were admitted to a hospital with covid_19–like illness and a positive sars_cov_2 reverse transcription–polymerase_chain_reaction ( rt_ pcr ) or antigen test result . control_patients were adults admitted to a hospital who received a negative sars_cov_2 rt_pcr test result . patients or their proxies were interviewed to obtain information about demographic characteristics , clinical history , and covid_19 vaccination . information regarding vaccine product received by patients was collected by interview and source veriﬁcation ( e.g. , state vaccination registries , hospital electronic medical records , and pharmacy records ) , including vaccine lot numbers , when these were documented . a patient was considered fully_vaccinated if the ﬁnal vaccine dose ( second dose for moderna and pﬁzer_biontech and the single janssen dose ) was received ≥14 days_before_illness_onset . * * patients were excluded if they received a covid_19 vaccine other than moderna , pﬁzer_biontech , or janssen ; received ≥1 vaccine dose but did not meet criteria for full vaccination ; or received doses of two different covid_19 vaccine products . for the postvaccination antibody analysis , healthy adults aged_≥18 years with no known prior sars_cov_2_infection were recruited during april 6–june 4 , 2021 , at three ivy sites . blood was collected 2–6 weeks after receipt of the second moderna and pﬁzer_biontech vaccine dose or the single janssen vaccine dose . sera were shipped to cdc , where they underwent testing for igg against three sars__cov_2 antigens : the spike_protein ( anti_spike ) ; the spike rbd ( anti_rbd ) ; and nucleocapsid ( anti_nucleocapsid ) . igg levels were measured using the v_plex sars_cov_2 panel 2 kit ( meso scale diagnostics ) and reported in international binding antibody units ( bau ) per milliliter . two participants with anti_nucleocapsid antibodies ( > 11.8 bau ) , which is suggestive of a prior sars_cov_2_infection , were excluded . ve against covid_19 hospitalization was estimated using logistic_regression , comparing the odds of being fully_vaccinated versus unvaccinated between case_patients and controls using the equation ve = 100 × ( 1 – adjusted odds_ratio ) ( 6,7 ) . the regression model included an indicator variable for vaccine type ( moderna , pﬁzer_biontech , or janssen ) and was adjusted for admission date , geographic region , age , sex , and race and hispanic ethnicity . a separate model added an interaction term between product type and time since vaccination . using these models , ve for mrna vaccine products was estimated for the full surveillance period ( march 11–august 15 ) , as well as 14–120 days and > 120 days after the receipt of the second dose . because a limited number of patients received janssen vaccine > 120 days_before_illness_onset ( 19 total ) , ve for the janssen vaccine was not stratiﬁed by time . in addition to a ve estimate deﬁning full vaccination as 14 days after a janssen vaccine dose , a sensitivity_analysis was conducted deﬁning full vaccination as 28 days after a janssen vaccine dose . statistical differences by vaccine product and time were assessed based on p_values generated using the tukey method for pair_wise multiple comparisons . in the postvaccination antibody analysis , pairwise comparisons of the quantity of anti_spike igg and anti_rbd igg were made among participants , by vaccine product received , using the wilcoxon rank_sum test . analyses were conducted using r statistical software ( version 4.0.3 ; r foundation ) and stata ( version 16 ; statacorp ) . procedures were approved as public health surveillance by each participating site and cdc and were conducted consistent with applicable federal law and cdc policy . after excluding 1,786 patients from the ve analysis ( 936 for having an immunocompromising condition , 566 who received ≥1 vaccine dose but were not fully_vaccinated , and 284 who did not meet other eligibility criteria ) , 3,689 patients were included ( 1,682 case_ patients and 2,007 control_patients ) . overall , 2,362 ( 64.0 % ) patients were unvaccinated ; 476 ( 12.9 % ) were fully_vaccinated with the moderna vaccine ; 738 ( 20.0 % ) were fully_vaccinated with the pﬁzer_biontech vaccine ; and 113 ( 3.1 % ) were fully_vaccinated with the janssen vaccine . among all participants , median_age was 58 years , 48 % were female , 23 % were non_hispanic black , and 18 % weretable 2 related materials pdf [ 154k ]  †_§ ¶ ††_§§_¶¶ hispanic ( table 1 ) . ve against covid_19 hospitalization during march 11–august 15 , 2021 , was higher for the moderna vaccine ( ve = 93 % ) than for the pﬁzer_biontech vaccine ( ve = 88 % ) ( p = 0.011 ) ; ve for both mrna vaccines was higher than that for the janssen vaccine ( ve = 71 % ) ( all p < 0.001 ) ( table 2 ) . ve for the moderna vaccine was 93 % at 14–120 days ( median = 66 days ) after receipt of the second vaccine dose and 92 % at > 120 days ( median = 141 days ) ( p = 1.000 ) . ve for the pﬁzer_biontech vaccine was 91 % at 14–120 days ( median = 69 days ) after receipt of the second vaccine dose but declined signiﬁcantly to 77 % at > 120 days ( median = 143 days ) ( p < 0.001 ) . the postvaccination antibody analysis included 100 healthy volunteers , 32 fully_vaccinated with moderna ( median_age = 31 years ;

iqr = 30–104 ; geometric mean = 56 ; 95 % ci = 32–97 bau/ml ) ( p < 0.001 ) . top discussion two_dose regimens of the moderna and pﬁzer_biontech mrna vaccines provided a high level of protection against covid_19 hospitalizations in a real_world evaluation at 21 u.s. hospitals during march–august 2021 . ve against covid_19 hospitalization for moderna and pﬁzer_biontech vaccines was 93 % and 88 % , respectively , whereas the single_dose janssen vaccine had somewhat lower ve at 71 % . persons vaccinated with janssen vaccine also had lower postvaccination anti_sars_cov_2 antibody levels than did recipients of mrna vaccines . although an immunologic correlate of protection has not been established for covid_19 vaccines , antibody titers after infection and vaccination have been associated with protection ( 8 ) . these real_world data suggest that the 2_dose moderna and pﬁzer_biontech mrna vaccine regimens provide more protection than does the 1_dose janssen viral vector vaccine regimen . although the janssen vaccine had lower observed ve , 1 dose of janssen vaccine still reduced risk for covid_19–associated hospitalization by 71 % . ve against covid_19 hospitalization was slightly lower for the 2_dose pﬁzer_biontech vaccine than the moderna vaccine , with this difference driven by a decline in ve after 120 days for the pﬁzer_biontech but not the moderna vaccine . the moderna vaccine also produced higher postvaccination anti_rbd antibody levels than did the pﬁzer_biontech vaccine . differences in ve between the moderna and pﬁzer_biontech vaccine might be due to higher mrna content in the moderna vaccine , differences in timing between doses ( 3 weeks for pﬁzer_biontech versus 4 weeks for moderna ) , or possible differences between groups that received each vaccine that were not accounted for in the analysis ( 9 ) . the ﬁndings in this report are subject to at least six limitations . first , this analysis did not consider children , immunocompromised adults , or ve against covid_19 that did not result in hospitalization . second , the cis for the janssen ve estimates were wide because of the relatively small number of patients who received this vaccine . third , follow_up time was limited to approximately 29 weeks since receipt of full vaccination , and further surveillance of ve over time is warranted . fourth , although ve estimates were adjusted for relevant potential confounders , residual confounding is possible . fifth , product_speciﬁc ve by variant , including against delta variants ( b.1.617.2 and ay sublineages ) , was not evaluated . finally , antibody levels were measured at only a single time point 2–6 weeks after vaccination and changes in antibody response over time as well as cell_mediated immune responses were not assessed . two_dose series of the moderna and pﬁzer_biontech mrna covid_19 vaccines provided high ve for the prevention of covid_19 hospitalizations during march–august 2021 . protection for the pﬁzer_biontech vaccine declined 4 months after vaccination . a single dose of the janssen viral vector vaccine had comparatively lower anti_sars_cov_2 antibody response and ve against covid_19 hospitalizations . understanding differences in ve by vaccine product can guide individual choices and policy recommendations regarding vaccine boosters . all fda_approved or authorized covid_19 vaccines provide substantial protection against covid_19 hospitalization . top ivy network nicole calhoun , baylor scott & white health ;

mrna_1273 ) covid_19 vaccines . clinical_trials for both vac__cines reported local injection_site reactions and systemic symptoms after both doses . 1,2 moderna additionally noteddelayed injection_site reactions ( on/after day 8 ) in 244 partic_ipants ( 0.8 % ) after the first dose and in 68 participants ( 0.2 % ) after the second dose . 1moderna ’ s trial also described vesicular , urticarial , exfoliative , macular , and papular rashes , as well as faci al swelling after cosmetic filler injections.1however , trials did not fully charac_ terize cutaneous_reactions and did not describe whether subjects with reactions after the first dosealso had reactions with the second . given the importance of widespread vaccination in curbing the pandemic , we aimed to collect casesof cutaneous side_effects to the messenger_rna ( mrna ) covid_19 vaccines ( 1 ) to describe the morphology and timing of cutaneous_reactions tothe pﬁzer and moderna vaccines and ( 2 ) to under_stand differences in cutaneous_reactions between the2 vaccine doses to guide vaccine counseling . methods our international registry of cutaneous manifes_ tations of sars_cov_2 , established in march 2020 as acollaboration between the american academy of dermatology and the international_league of dermatological societies , expanded on december24 , 2020 , to collect covid_19 vaccine cutaneousreactions , shortly after the food and drugadministration issued emergency useauthorizations ( www.aad.org/covidregistry ) . 3case entry in the registry was open to health care workersonly . collected data were deidentified . the vaccine module of the registry collected dates for both vaccine doses , morphology of cutaneousreaction ( s ) , timing and dura_tion of reaction ( s ) , and treat_ments . local site reactions were deﬁned as occurring within 3 days of ﬁrst_dosevaccination and delayedlarge local reactions weredeﬁned as occurring 4 ormore days after the ﬁrstvaccination . a wheal at thevaccine site was considered an immediate or delayed_large_local reaction , depend_ing on timing . 4conversely , urticarial reactions weredefined as wheals in a distri_ bution beyond the injection_site . we only included cutaneous_reactions reported after vaccination with food and drug administration_approved pﬁzer or moderna mrna vaccines , which at the time of analysis were beingadministered mostly to health care workers andelderly patients . both vaccines require 2 dosesadministered 3_4 weeks apart . all respondents whoonly entered a cutaneous reaction to the ﬁrst vaccinedose were sent a follow_up email to solicit thepresence/absence of a cutaneous reaction to the second vaccine dose . we contacted providers who entered partially completed records and asked themto complete all ﬁelds . we excluded records wherethe provider was ultimately unable to provide keyvariables ( eg , vaccine brand or those in whichvaccine dose elicited a reaction ) . we used stataversion 16 ( statacorp , llc ) to descriptively analyzedata . the massachusetts general brigham institutional_review_board exempted this study as not human subject research . results from december 24 , 2020 , to february 14 , 2021 , one or more cutaneous_reactions to moderna ( 83 % ) or pﬁzer ( 17 % ) covid_19 vaccines were reported byhealthcare workers for 414 unique patients ( fig 1 ) . median patient age was 44 years ( interquartile_range [ iqr ] , 36_59 years ) , and patients were 90 % female , 78 % white , and primarily from the united_states ( 98 % ; table i ) . cases were reported bycapsule summary dacross 414 cutaneous_reactions to the messenger_rna covid_19 vaccines in our registry , the most commonmorphologies were delayed large localreactions , local injection_site reactions , urticaria , and morbilliform eruptions . dless than 50 % of patients withcutaneous reactions after the first doseexperienced second_dose recurrence.none reported serious adverse events.jamacaddermatol volume 85 , n umber 1mcmahon et al 47 dermatologists ( 30 % ) , other physicians ( 26 % ) , mid_ level practitioners ( 8.8 % ) , nurses ( 13 % ) , and otherhealth care workers ( 22 % ) . of the 414 patient records reviewed , information about both vaccine doses was available for 180 ( 43 % of cases ) . of these , 38/180 ( 21 % ) reported reactions after the ﬁrst_dose only , 113/180 ( 63 % ) reported areaction after the second dose only , and 29/180 ( 16 % ) reported reactions to both doses ( supplemental fig 1 available via mendeley athttps : //data.mendeley.com/datasets/3t4zn67nc4 ) . therefore , of the 67 patients who had a cutaneousreaction to the first dose , 29 ( 43 % ) also had a cutaneous reaction to the second dose . of these 29 patients who reported reactions after both doses , 8 ( 28 % ) reported similar reactions to both doses , 8 ( 28 % ) reported a lesser reaction to the second dose , and 13 ( 45 % ) reported a more robust reaction to thesecond dose ( fig 2 ) . there were 343 unique reports of cutaneous manifestations after the moderna vaccination , including 267 reported after the ﬁrst_dose and 102 reported after the second dose . the most commoncutaneous reactions were delayed_large_local re_actions ( n = 175 ﬁrst ; n = 31 second dose ) , localinjection site reaction ( n = 117 ﬁrst_dose ; n = 69 second dose ) , urticaria ( n = 16 ﬁrst_dose ; n = 7 second dose ) , morbilliform ( n = 11 ﬁrst_dose ; 7 second dose ) , and erythromelalgia ( n = 5 ﬁrst_dose ; n = 6 second dose ; table ii ) . of the 343 patients with cutaneous manifestations , only reactions to the first dose were recorded for 215 ( 63 % ) patients , of whom203 ( 94 % ) planned to receive the second dose and 12 ( 5.6 % ) did not plan to receive the second dose due toconcerns regarding their first_dose cutaneous re_actions . of those who reported information forboth doses ( n = 130 ) , 28 ( 22 % ) reported a reaction to the first dose only , 76 ( 58 % ) reported a reaction to the second dose only , and 26 ( 20 % ) reported re_actions to both doses . there were 71 reports of pﬁzer vaccine cutaneous manifestations , including 34 after the ﬁrst_dose and40 after the second dose . the most common wereurticaria ( n = 8 , ﬁrst_dose ; n = 6 , second dose ) , localinjection site reaction ( n = 8 , ﬁrst_dose ; n = 8 , second dose ) , and morbilliform rash ( n = 6 , ﬁrst_dose ; n = 3 , second dose ) . of the 71 cases with cutaneousmanifestations , only reactions to the ﬁrst_dose wererecorded for 21 ( 30 % ) . these included patients whowere planning to receive their second dose ( n = 12 ) and patients not planning to receive their second dose ( n = 4 ) because of concerns regarding their ﬁrstcutaneous reactions . of 50 patients with informationentered for both pﬁzer doses , 10 ( 20 % ) reportedreactions after the ﬁrst_dose only , 37 ( 74 % ) after thesecond dose only , and 3 ( 6.0 % ) after both doses . of the 414 records , 350 ( 85 % ) had timing infor_ mation . the median time from ﬁrst vaccination to onset of cutaneous symptoms was 7 days ( iqr 2_8 ) , which occurred in 2 clusters , one between days 1and 3 and the other between days 7 and 8 ( fig 3 ) . the majority of timing data came from patients withreactions on the vaccinated arm only , with localinjection site reaction occurring a median of 1 day ( iqr 0_1 ) and delayed_large_local reactions occurringmedian 7 days ( iqr 7_8 ) after vaccination ( supplemental_table i available via mendeley at https : //data.mendeley.com/datasets/3t4zn67nc4 ) . the median time from second_dose vaccination tocutaneous symptom onset was shorter , occurring atday 1 ( iqr 1_2 ) . no urticaria or angioedema reportsafter the first dose were immediate in onset ; all cameafter 1 day or more . of 18 patients who reportedurticaria after their first vaccine dose for which information about their second vaccine dose was entered , urticaria developed only in 4 ( 22 % ) aftertheir second dose , with most ( n = 3 ) reporting morewidespread urticaria . delayed_large_local arm reactions occurred pri_ marily after moderna vaccination ( 94 % ) at a median of7 days ( iqr 7_8 ) after the ﬁrst vaccine and lasted amedian of 4 days ( iqr 3_6 ; fig 3 ) . the reaction occurred more quickly after the second vaccine dose , at a median of 2 days ( iqr 1_3 ) and lasted a median of3 days ( iqr 2_5 ) . for patients who had delayed largelocal reactions after both doses ( n = 11 ) , 3 ( 27 % ) had alarger reaction with the second dose . a smaller groupof patients who did not have any cutaneous reactionafter the first vaccine dose had a delayed large localreaction to the second dose ( n = 23 ) , which occurred a median of 2 days ( iqr 1_3 ) after the second vaccination . one hundred sixteen of the 207 ( 56 % ) patients with delayed_large_local reactions also hadpreceding local site injection reactions . less common reports of other cutaneous ﬁndings with both vaccines included 9 reports of swelling atthe site of cosmetic ﬁllers , 8 pernio/chilblains , 10varicella zoster , 4 herpes simplex ﬂares , 4 pityriasis rosea_like reactions , and 4 rashes in infants of vaccinated breastfeeding mothers . discussion in this registry_based study , we characterized the morphology and timing of cutaneous_reactions forabbreviations used : iqr : interquartile_range mrna : messenger rnajamacaddermatol july202148 mcmahon et al the novel moderna and pﬁzer mrna covid_19 vaccines . we observed a broad spectrum of reported reactions after vaccination , from local injection_site reactions and delayed_large_local reactions , to urti_caria and morbilliform eruptions , to more unusualreactions , such as erythromelalgia , pernio/chilblains , ﬁller reactions , and pityriasis_rosea_like eruptions.of 67 patients with cutaneous ﬁndings after the ﬁrstdose and in whom information on both doses wasavailable , only 29 ( 43 % ) showed cutaneous symp_ toms after the second dose . this analysis should provide reassurance to health care providers coun_seling patients who had a cutaneous reaction afterthe ﬁrst_dose of moderna or pﬁzer vaccine regardingtheir second dose , as there were no cases ofanaphylaxis or other serious_adverse_events . 5 the most commonly reported cutaneous ﬁnding after vaccine administration was a delayed_large_local reaction a median of 7 days after the ﬁrst vaccine dose , primarily after moderna ( 94 % ) .second_dose delayed reactions generally occurredmore quickly ( day 2 ) and were generally lesser.similarly , the moderna clinical_trial described 0.8 % participants in whom delayed_large_local reactionsdeveloped from the ﬁrst_dose after day 8 , and only 0.2 % of participants experienced a reaction with the second dose but did not link thereactions from 1 dose to another and , thus , wouldhave missed detecting it if patients reacted morequickly to the second dose . 1,6rarely , delayed_ type hypersensitivity reactions have beendescribed after vaccination , with symptoms suchas large localized swelling , skin nodules , and/or induration . these reactions , thought to be medi_ ated by t cells , have been attributed to ingredi_ents such as neomycin or thimersol and have notbeen considered as a contraindication to subse_quent vaccination . 4although the etiology of these delayed_large_local reactions due to the modernavaccine is unclear , a delayed_type hypersensitivityreaction to the excipient polyethylene glycol is 1 potential etiology . 6 in our registry , no severe sequelae were i_d e n t i ﬁ e da f t e rt h es e c o n dd o s ei np a t i e n t se

average , likely to be less severe and may develop faster , and ( 3 ) symptom_ atic therapies ( eg , ice/pain_relief/antihistamines/topical corticosteroids ) can be used for treatmentwithout antibiotics . we additionally observed reactions to moderna and pﬁzer vaccines that had been noted after thesars_cov_2 infection itself , including pernio/chil_blains ( eg , ‘ ‘ covid toes ’ ’ ) , erythromelalgia , and pityriasis_rosea_like exanthems . 3,8,9that these exan_ thems mimic dermatologic manifestations of covid_ 19 potentially suggests that ( 1 ) the host immuneresponse to the virus is being replicated by thevaccine and ( 2 ) some components of these derma_tologic manifestations of the virus are likely to befrom an immune response to the virus rather thandirect viral effects . 10,11erythromelalgia and pityriasis rosea have been noted in response to other vaccines , such as those for influenza and hepatitis b , although not commonly.12_14 we additionally identiﬁed rare patients with facial swelling after both moderna and pﬁzer vaccines , which were associated with prior use of injectablecosmetic ﬁller . this phenomenon was similarlydescribed in 3 subjects in moderna

distinguish immediate hypersen_ sitivity reactions , deﬁned by the centers_for_disease_control and prevention as including pruritus , urticaria , ﬂushing , and angioedema occurring within the ﬁrst4 hours of an injection , from similar reactions thatoccur [ 4 hours after injection . 18this distinction is particularly relevant for urticaria and angioedema , which are potential contraindications for a secondvaccine dose . 18although this registry captured time between vaccination and skin reaction in days ratherthan hours , none of the first_dose urticaria reports orangioedema reports occurred on the day of vaccina_tion and , therefore , would not be classified as imme_diate hypersensitivity . of the 18 urticaria reports whereinformation was available for both vaccine doses , only4 had urticaria with their second dose and nonereported anaphylaxis , which should provide reassur_ ance regarding patients in whom urticaria develops [ 4 hours after first vaccination . importantly , allergic cutaneous symptoms reported in this study , such as urticaria , angioedema , and/or morbilliform eruptions , may not be caused by allergy to the vaccine but insteadrelated to host immune response or an immunologicreaction to nonsteroidal anti_inflammatory agentscommonly taken for pain and fever after vaccination . another limitation of this registry analysis in_ cludes an incomplete record follow_up . becauseproviders only enter data at 1 point in time , patientshave differential lengths of follow_up . to overcomethis , we reached out via email to all providers aftersuch patients received second doses ; nevertheless , we still mostly report information regarding ﬁrstvaccine dose reactions . reporting on the second vaccine dose may be more common when there are symptoms ( rather than no reaction ) to report . assuch , this reporting bias might result in our studydemonstrating a ‘ ‘ worst case scenario ’ ’ for the seconddose . still , less than half of patients had recurrencewith the second dose . an additional limitation is thatthe morphology description of vaccine reactions isprovider dependent . future studies are needed to classify morphologies with objectively classiﬁable clinical images and histopathologic evaluation . we are unable to measure the incidence of cutaneous_reactions to covid_19 vaccinationthrough a registry_based study , which lacks a denom_inator . there may be conﬁrmation bias , as providerswere more likely to enter cases with severe or raremanifestations . the registry noted 343 reactions from the moderna vaccine and only 71 from the pﬁzer vaccine , but it will require further population_leveldata to understand whether this is a true difference orrelated to reporting bias . as of february 22 , 2021 , 53 % of allocated vaccine doses in the united_states weremoderna and 47 % were pﬁzer . 19,20ninety percent of the vaccine reactions were reported in female patients . it is difﬁcult to assesswhether there is a true sex_related difference in thelikelihood of the development of a cutaneous reac_tion or whether it might reﬂect reporting bias or stemfrom the health care workforce being 76 % female . 21 further , vaccine reactions in this registry were pri_marily in white ( 78 % ) patients , which highlightsimportant concerns about disparities in vaccine ac_ cess , health care access after experiencing a potential side effect , differential likelihood of reporting to theregistry , and/or recognition of skin reactions byhealth care providers in patients with skin of co_lor . 22,23patients were primarily located in the united_states ( 98 % ) ; at this time , there were no reports in theregistry of cutaneous_reactions from patients in low_and middle_income_countries , raising attention to global inequities in covid_19 vaccine access . 24 we characterize a spectrum of cutaneous reac_ tions reported with novel mrna vaccines for covid_19 . certain dermatologic ﬁndings echo priorvaccine hypersensitivity knowledge , while newerﬁndings , such as delayed_large_local reactions to themoderna vaccine and ﬁller reactions may suggestnew immunologic mechanisms . pernio/chilblains post vaccine may suggest an immunologic connec_ tion to infection with sars_cov_2 . 8,9 conclusions overall , our data support that cutaneous_reactions to covid_19 vaccination are generally minor and self_limited and should not discourage vaccina__tion.1,2presence of a cutaneous reaction to the first vaccine dose , when it appears [ 4 hours after injec_ tion , is not a contraindication to receiving the seconddose of the pfizer or moderna vaccine . no patientswith these findings experienced anaphylaxis oranother severe adverse_event . health care workersmust be aware of these potential vaccine reactions and advise patients accordingly . counseling patients about potential benefits of receiving a covid_19vaccine is equally , if not more , important . the authors

coronavirus disease 2019 ; vaccines ; variant strains ; antiviral therapy 1 introduction and virology coronaviruses are a diverse group of enveloped , single_stranded , positive_sense rna viruses that have a wide_ranged tropism , giving them the ability to cause devastating diseases . they have the largest genome of all rna_based viruses with 26–32 kb , along with a 5′ and 3′ poly_a tail [ 1–3 ] . the three most notable coronaviruses that affect the human population are sars_cov_1 in 2002 and mers_cov in 2012 , both of which caused epidemics , and sars_cov_2 in 2019 , which is the causative agent of the current coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid_19 ) pandemic . according to the world_health_organization ( who ) dashboard ( https : //covid19.who.int/ ) , as of june 21 , 2021 , there have been 178 118 597 confirmed cases and 3 864 180 deaths of covid_19 globally . the key structural components of the pathologic strains include the membrane , envelope , nucleocapsid , and spike_proteins , sharing the core conservative elements across the coronavirus family [ 4 ] . sars_ cov_1 and sars_cov_2 share 94.6 % amino_acid sequence along with 80 % nucleotide base_pairing [ 5 ] . although sars_cov_2 encodes the four core conservative elements , it is significantly different from previous pathologic coronavirus strains because it also expresses 8 accessory proteins [ 3a , 3b , p6 , 7a , 7b , 8b , 9b , and open_reading_frame ( orf ) 14 ] which are not all conservative among sars_cov_2 , sars_cov_1 , and mers_cov [ 2 ] . the major entry receptor for both sars_ cov_1 and sars_cov_2 binding is the angiotensin_converting enzyme 2 ( ace2 ) on host_cells contrasting with mers_cov which utilizes dipeptidyl peptidase 4 or cd26 for entry . the sars_cov_2 binds with ace2 via its spike_protein ( s protein ) . the s protein is composed of 2 subunits , s1 and s2 , with each s protein consisting of three s1/s2 subunits that create a trimer ( fig . 1a ) [ 6 , 7 ] . the s1 subunit is responsible for the binding of ace2 via the receptor_binding domain ( rbd ) , whereas s2 contains the fusion peptide as well as the transmembrane domain [ 7 ] . the entry of sars_cov_2 into host_cells depends on two key 1038 current_medical_science_41 ( 6 ) :2021 factors : ( 1 ) binding of the viral spike_proteins to host cellular receptor ace2 ; and ( 2 ) s protein priming by the host_cell protease , transmembrane protease serine 2 ( tmprss2 ) [ 8–10 ] . ace2 is a type ⅰ transmembrane metallocarboxypeptidase with homology to ace , presenting on multiple cell types such as endothelial cells , pneumocyte_2 in the lungs , and enterocytes . the utilization of ace2 is a basis for many clinical symptoms presented in covid_19 patients , and we will discuss in next paragraph . the rbd of the viral spike_protein is significant for viral infectivity and the rbd between sars_cov_1 and sars_cov_2 shares 73 % –76 % conservation . it was found that the trimer formation of the s protein in sars_cov_2 had a higher affinity for the ace2 receptor than sars_cov_1 ( fig . 1b ) [ 6 , 7 ] . mutations within the s protein can have a major impact on the tropism , infectivity , and ultimately the lethality of the virus . patients with covid_19 present with diverse clinical presentations and symptoms including fatigue , fever , cough , loss of smell or tasting , and headache , etc . around 30 % of the patients also reported gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea , nausea , and stomach pain [ 11 , 12 ] . a study of 254 patients showed that the most common complication was pneumonia ( 82.3 % ) , followed by arrhythmia ( 0.06 % ) , and shock ( 0.03 % ) [ 11 ] . in patients hospitalized for covid_19 infections , the most prevalent underlying conditions included age , obesity , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , heart disease , and lung disease [ 13 , 14 ] . the way in which sars_cov_2 enters host_cells can explain the wide variety of symptoms mentioned above , especially the function and locations of ace2 receptors in viral entry . specifically , viruses are first recognized by toll_like receptors on host_cells , which initiate the activation of nf_кb , which then activates the ace2 receptors on host endothelial cells in the respiratory_tract , gastrointestinal_tract , and kidney . following the activation of ace2 receptors , the viruses can then enter cells and begin replication [ 15 ] . this process also initiates the “ cytokine storm ” , a hallmark of acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome ( ards ) which is the leading cause of death due to severe infection of sars_cov_2 [ 16 , 17 ] . patients with covid_19 also have an increased risk of vascular crisis , which can be explained by the binding of s protein and ace2 . ace2 converts angiotensin ⅱ to angiotensin [ 1–7 ] , protecting endothelial cell function and preventing atherosclerosis which can be caused by blood clots . when the ace2 is bound to the viral s protein , the protective function of ace2 is inhibited , leading to vascular occlusion in covid_19 patients [ 18 ] . upon entering the host_cells , the single strand rna genome can trigger an immune response via pathogen_associated molecular patterns ( pamps ) [ 19 ] . sars__cov_2 is a cytopathic virus which can cause pyroptosis ( a highly inflammatory form of programmed death ) of the host_cells . the virus also causes the release of pro_inflammatory damage_associates molecular patterns ( damps ) such as atp and nucleic_acids , as well as induces a local immune response with cytokines like il_6 . the damps trigger the migration of other immune cells such as macrophages , monocytes , and t cells , which further increase the inflammation by releasing pro_inflammatory cytokines . in a susceptible immune system , the increase in viral load and inflammation lead to the cytokine storm , with severe cases showing an increase in il_2 , il_7 , il_10 , g_csf , tnf_α , and macrophage inflammatory protein 1α ( mip1α ) , ultimately leading to multi_organ damage as well as septic shock [ 20 ] . in addition to the cytokine storm , t cells and b cells also play important roles in disease severity and defense . zheng et al found that t cell exhaustion was associated with cytotoxicity reduction . they also reported that increased t cell exhaustion and reduced t cell function predicted severe diseases , as functional interferon_γ ( ifn_γ ) and tumor necrosis factor_α ( tnf_α ) of cd4 + t cells were lower , and levels of sars_cov_2 hr2 spike_protein ( trimer ) receptor ( ace2 ) host cellhr1s1ab s2 fig . 1 the schematic structure of sars_cov_2 a : the structure of the s protein ; b : the relationship between the viral s protein and host_cell ’ s ace2 receptor 1039 current_medical_science_41 ( 6 ) :2021 cd8+ perforin and granzyme b were higher in severe cases [ 21 ] . a significant function of the b cells against sars_cov_2 is neutralization . neutralizing_antibodies bind to the virus and block infection through two possible mechanisms : ( 1 ) by targeting the s protein and preventing its interaction with ace2 receptors , or ( 2 ) by binding to a viral capsid in a manner that prevents uncoating of the genome [ 20 ] . a proposed adaptive immune response against sars_cov_2 which requires the stimulation of b and t cells is shown in fig . 2a [ 22 ] . despite the need for appropriate b cell response to eradicate viral infection , a major flaw that counteracts the antibody effects is antibody_ dependent enhancement ( ade ) , a phenomenon in which virus_specific antibodies enhance the entry and replication of virus into monocytes/macrophages and granulocytic cells through interaction with fc and/or complement receptors [ 23 , 24 ] . it is not fully understood how sars_cov_2 can exactly utilize this mechanism to exacerbate covid_19 , but proposed theories suggest that ade may induce the severe symptoms seen , and explain why non_neutralizing antibodies inflammation at the injection_site neutrophil monocytemrna+lnp mdcpdcuptake and translation vaccine_specific th1 cellsmemory b cell memory b cellplasma cellsplasma cell naive b celltrh ctrhtype ư ifnsmigration to vaccine_draining lymph nodesantigen presentationeffector ctl plasma cellantibody productionb7.1/b7.2 cd28 b7.1/b7.2cd28cd28 pctlapcsars_cov_2 b cell mhc ư+ agcd8 tcr mhc ư+ agcd4 tcr mhc ư+ agcd4 tcr il_2 il_12 ifn_γ tgf_αil_4 , il_5 il_6 , il_10 tgf_βinfected cell th 1 cell th0 cellth2 cell memory b cell germinal_center formation migration to the periphery and bone marrowa b fig . 2 immune response against sars_cov_2_infection and mrna vaccine a : the proposed adaptive immune response against coronavirus sars_cov_2 requires stimulation of b cell and t cell epitopes . after human cells are infected by virus entities , epitopes from viruses ’ proteins can be bound and presented by mhc_1 receptors on host_cell surfaces , leading to the stimulation of cd4 and cd8 t cells to provoke antibody_mediated and cell_mediated immune responses ; b : the proposed adaptive immune responses after mrna vaccination . local inflammation at the injection_site promotes the infiltration of immune cells , including neutrophils , monocytes , myeloid dendritic_cells ( mdcs ) and plasmacytoid dendritic_cells ( pdcs ) . neutrophils can efficiently take up lipid nanoparticles , and monocytes and mdcs translate mrna efficiently . secretion of type ⅰ interferons ( ifns ) is stimulated . mrna and protein antigen will disseminate and cells will migrate to the vaccine_draining lymph nodes . antigen presentation to t cells and interactions of antigen and b cells take place at these sites , leading to the formation of germinal centers , which results in the generation of memory b cells and antibody_producing plasma cells that reside to the bone marrow . 1040 current_medical_science_41 ( 6 ) :2021 produced by b cells enhance sars_cov_2_infection in some cases [ 25 ] . the ade is also a consideration during vaccine development , and will be discussed in the “ vaccine development and mechanisms ” section . many other variables , such as genetics , comorbidities , and health status , also contribute to the efficiency of an individual ’ s immune response . a healthy innate defense can eradicate the pathogen , however , when the innate response is compromised , this can lead to increased viral load and tissue damage , and ultimately severe symptoms . 2 v accine development and mechani_ sms throughout the past year , multiple vaccines against sars_cov_2 have either already been developed or are in the process of being developed worldwide . according to the who dashboard , as of june 21 , 2021 , 2 412 226 768 vaccine doses have been administered globally . however , despite the rapid production and distribution of vaccines , several new strains originating from various regions globally are continuing to be discovered , and the current vaccines may not be sufficient to protect the population . therefore , it is vital to understand the mechanism of current vaccines being produced , as well as investigate new research for potential new vaccines and treatments to prevent another wave of the current global pandemic . currently , there are three common types of vaccines against sars_cov_2 virus : mrna , adenovirus vector , and inactivated vaccines . the mrna vaccine generally consists only of the genetic code for a single antigen of the sars_cov_2 ( e.g. , s protein antigen ) , wrapped in a shell and delivered by lipid nanoparticles . when the mrna vaccine is injected into the body , human cells use the viral genetic code to make the encoded antigen , then the body reacts and makes antibodies [ 26 ] . unlike the mrna vaccines , adenovirus vector vaccines generally use the dna of the s protein antigen . instead of using lipid nanoparticles to deliver the genetic code into the body , viral vector vaccines use a modified virus ( different from sars_cov_2 , such as adenovirus ) as a vector to deliver the genetic information . when these adenoviruses containing dna for the s protein enter the body , the viral proteins will be produced and further activates immune responses [ 27 ] . inactivated vaccines use inactivated sars_cov_2 viruses , and viral inactivation is achieved by using chemicals , heat , or radiation . the inactivated viruses contain antigens , and when they are injected into the body , these antigens will provoke an immune response [ 28–30 ] . the major current vaccines being used and developed are listed in table 1 . the two currently well_known vaccines on the market , developed by pfizer_biontech , inc. ( usa ) and moderna , inc. ( usa ) , are mrna vaccines . the pfizer_ biontech vaccine was approved by the united_states ( u.s. ) fda to use in individuals of 16 years and older on december 11 , 2020 , and are currently authorized to use in more than 80 counties including usa , uk , and countries in the european union . on may 10 , 2021 , the u.s. fda expanded the emergency_use_authorization ( eua ) to include adolescents of 12–15 years_of_age . the moderna vaccine is authorized by u.s. fda for use under an eua for active immunization to prevent covid_19 in individuals of 18 years_of_age and older on december 18 , 2020 . it is currently authorized for use in more than 40 countries including usa , canada , uk , and european union . the mrna vaccine developed by moderna encodes the entire 1273 amino_acid sequence of the viral s protein and is therefore named the mrna_1273 vaccine . pfizer_biontech , however , developed two vaccines : bnt162b1 ( consisting of the rbd , a part of the s1 subunit of s protein ) and bnt162b2 ( consisting full_length of s_protein amino_acid sequence , similar to the moderna vaccine ) [ 26 ] . a functional mrna vaccine requires essential elements including the 5′ cap , 5′ utr , orf , 3′ utr , and poly_a tail . when developing vaccines , the 5′ cap is often modified to ensure that no reverse binding occurs , which can decrease the efficiency of translation once the vaccine enters the host . it is also important to modify the 5′ and 3′ utrs to optimize the mrna sequence stability , along with the poly_a tail . the codons of the orf are also optimized for translation activity and protein quality [ 31 ] . an advantage of using mrna vaccines is that they can be modified by altering the sequence , which will be beneficial to make vaccines protective against new viral strains [ 31 ] . the robust host immune response after vaccine administration can be partly attributed to the self_adjuvant property of mrna vaccines . after initial inflammation at the site of injection , the mrna is translated and taken to lymph nodes , where it is recognized by antigen_presenting cells . host toll_like receptors are then activated , which leads to cytokine production . the overarching result is a t cell response with elevated cd8 + and th1 type cd4+ cells . cd4+ t cells are crucial for b cell differentiation , which is necessary for the production of memory immune cells to protect host_cells from future viral invasion . the proposed process of generation of adaptive immune responses by mrna vaccination is illustrated in fig . 2b [ 32 ] . currently , all available mrna covid_19 vaccines require a lipid nanoparticle component for delivery . lipid nanoparticles assist the virus to penetrate host_cell membrane . the schematic structure and functions of mrna_lipid nanoparticle complex are illustrated in fig . 3 [ 26 , 33 ] . one disadvantage of using lipid nanoparticles as a delivery system is that they require 1041

, nausea , headache , muscle pain , joint_pain , chills , fever , itching , and rash ) . im : intramuscular injection fig . 3 schematic structure of mrna_lipid nanoparticle complex the lipid nanoparticles are used in mrna delivery . the negative charge of mrna electrostatically repulses the anionic ( negatively charged ) cell member , preventing its uptake into the cells . therefore , mrna vaccines require a delivery vehicle and the lipid nanoparticles are commonly used as mrna carriers . lipid nanoparticles are mainly composed of ionizable lipids , cholesterol , phospholipids , and polyethylene glycol ( peg ) _lipid . the ionizable lipids are cationic ( positively charged ) at a low ph ( enabling negatively_charged rna complexation ) and neutral at physiological ph ( reducing potential toxic effects ) , allowing a better delivery of mrna into the cells via endocytosis . phospholipids play a structural role and cholesterol serves as a stabilizing element in lipid nanoparticles . lipid_anchored pegs dominantly deposit on the lipid nanoparticle surface as a barrier to sterically stabilize them and reduce nonspecific binding to proteins . thus , the lipid nanoparticles have an efficient and safe profile for mrna vaccine delivery . ionizable lipids peg_phospholipids phospholipids cholesterol mrna 1042 current_medical_science_41 ( 6 ) :2021 the vaccines to be stored at frozen temperatures ( –20°c or less ) for long_term_storage . if stored at refrigerated temperatures ( 2–8°c ) , the vaccines will only be stable for a short amount of time , approximately 5–30 days [ 34 ] . different from pfizer_biontech and moderna , the manufactory johnson_&_johnson developed the vaccine ad26.cov2.s ( research name : jnj_ 78436735 ) , which is an adenovirus vector vaccine , or viral vector vaccine . although this vaccine still utilizes the s protein amino_acid sequence of sars_cov_2 , it requires adenovirus 26 dna as a vector . the host immune response to the vaccine is still against sars_cov_2 , and the immunologic mechanism by which it protects the host is similar to the mrna vaccine as has described above [ 27 ] . one of the advantages of using a viral vector vaccine is the ability to rapidly produce the vaccines once the viral vector is synthesized in the lab . the johnson_&_johnson vaccine was approved by u.s. fda under eua for its single_dose vaccine to prevent covid_19 in individuals of 18 years_of_age and older on february 27 , 2021 . the administration of the johnson_&_johnson viral vector vaccine was temporarily paused in mid_april 2021 due to its potential to cause cerebral venous sinus thrombosis , but resumed distribution in late april 2021 ( benefits outweighed the risks ) in the u.s . the other vaccine ( aza1222 ) , developed by astrazeneca and oxford university , is a viral vector vaccine . it was first approved in the united_kingdom ( uk ) on december 30 , 2020 , and has since been approved in multiple countries in europe and asia . however , it has not been approved by the u.s. fda thus far . aza1222 was suspended in some countries ( e.g . south africa , europe , canada ) in february 2021 , for similar reasons that the johnson and johnson vaccine was paused ( mainly due to formation of blood clots ) [ 35 ] . currently , in addition to the u.s. and europe , multiple covid_19 vaccines have been approved and distributed to use globally , and several vaccine candidates are still in the clinical_trials or are in the process of being approved . for example , china ’ s sinopharm bbibp_cov vaccine was approved for emergency use by the who on may 7 , 2021 . this vaccine is different from the vaccines previously approved for emergency use because it is an inactivated vaccine . this vaccine has similar effectiveness to the johnson_&_johnson and astrazeneca vaccines at 78 % efficacy and requires two doses intramuscularly ( im ) . bbibp_corv is being used in certain countries in asia , africa , south america , and europe [ 29 , 36 ] . sinovac ’ s coronavac is another inactivated vaccine being developed in china that also requires two doses im . coronavac was approved in china and some other countries such as the philippines and cambodia in february 2021 , and who validated the vaccine for emergency use on june 1 , 2021 . it showed 50 % –84 % of efficacy preventing covid_19 , and is being used in various countries in asia , south america , north_america , and europe [ 30 , 37 ] . china is also in the process of developing another viral vector vaccine ( ad5_ncov , trade named : convidecia ) , produced by cansino biologics . this vaccine uses adenovirus type 5 as a viral vector and was proven to be 67.2 % effective in its phase ⅲ_clinical trial . it is authorized for use in china , mexico , pakistan , hungary , chile , argentina and some other countries [ 29 , 38–40 ] . a very recent phase ⅲ_clinical trial of two inactivated vaccines developed by china , wivo04 and hb02 , showed that they both significantly reduce the risk of symptomatic covid_19 ( the efficacy is 72.8 % for wivo4 and 78.1 % for hbo2 ) and serious_adverse_events were rare [ 27 ] . russia also developed an adenovirus viral vector vaccine , called gam_covid_vac or sputnik v , by the gamaleya research institute of epidemiology and microbiology . it was registered on august 11 , 2020 by the russian ministry of health , and emergency mass_destitution began in december 2020 in countries including russia , argentina , belarus , hungary , serbia and the united_arab_emirates . although the vaccine requires 2 doses to reach its efficacy of 91.6 % , russia approved of giving the vaccine as a one_dose emergency administration , which had an efficacy of 79.4 % [ 41 , 42 ] . the novavax covid_19 vaccine , also known as nvx_cov2373 , is developed by novavax and the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations ( cepi ) . it is currently in phase ⅲ_clinical trial and was proven to be 89.3 % effective . it requires two doses and is stable at 2 to 8°c . this vaccine is described as both a protein subunit vaccine and a virus_like particle vaccine , though the producers call it a “ recombinant nanoparticle vaccine ” . the vaccine is produced by creating an engineered baculovirus containing a gene for a modified sars_cov_2 s protein [ 43–45 ] . while the majority of the vaccines being studied for protection against sars_cov_2 are to be injected im , there have been a few companies investigating potential mucosal and oral delivery . ios_bio , a company based out of the uk , is in the process of developing a potential oral vaccine , orapro_covid_19 . this vaccine encodes the s protein and requires a replication_ defective ad5 vector , similar to the vector used in cansino ’ s im vaccine mentioned above . one of the potential benefits of oral vaccine delivery over im is the storage ease . comparing to intramuscular vaccines which require nanoparticles for delivery and cold temperature for storage , oral vaccines are delivered in a thermally stable capsule to avoid degradation in the gastrointestinal system , therefore , they do not need refrigeration for storage [ 46 ] . vxa_cov2_1 is a non_replicating ad5 vector adjuvanted oral tableted vaccine being developed by 1043 current_medical_science_41 ( 6 ) :2021 vaxart inc. a phase ⅱ trial will be started by mid_ year in 2021 . this vaccine will trigger host mucosal immunity by targeting the viral nucleocapsid ( n ) protein ( a viral protein packaging the genome ) as well as the s protein [ 47 , 48 ] . this will be extremely advantageous given that the n protein is associated with the viral dna and rna and is less susceptible to mutations , meaning that this vaccine has the potential to more effective against the new variants due to the fact that most of the mutations in the new variants involve the s protein rather than the n protein . medicago , a company based in quebec city , canada , is attempting to produce a non_infectious , plant_based vaccine against covid_19 . the company had already been successful in producing a plant_based vaccine against influenza , and claimed one advantage of this vaccine , accuracy , in targeting specific strains of influenza . these plant_based vaccines utilize virus_like particles ( vlps ) of sars_cov_2 ( e.g. , consisting of viral s protein ) . vlps mimic the structure and function of the virus , but lack the genetic material required to infect host_cells [ 49 ] . these vlps are inserted into the bacterium agrobacterium , which is taken up by plants in soil . eventually , the plants are able to produce non_infectious and non_replicating vlps in high volume , present a shell structure covered with the antigen required to trigger immune responses [ 50 ] . by mimicking the native structure of viruses , vlps can be better recognized by the immune system because of their size , structure , and repeated antigen patterns are able to stimulate a more efficient immune response , compared with other types of vaccines . moreover , this vaccine could have two additional advantages over the others : ( 1 ) they are cheaper to produce and will be beneficial in developing_countries ; and ( 2 ) they can precisely and rapidly protect against new mutant viral strains . as discussed above , multiple countries and manufactures are in the process of developing covid_19 vaccines , and some of them have been approved and used , with highly effective efficacy . a determining factor for the response to sars_cov_2_infection is the concentration of neutralizing_antibodies found in the serum . neutralizing_antibodies might block interactions with receptors or bind to a viral capsid in a manner that prevents uncoating of the genome , further blocking infection . a recent study compared the post_ vaccination concentration of neutralizing_antibodies induced by major developed vaccines . it was found that mrna_1273 and nvx_cov23373 had the highest titer levels of neutralizing_antibodies , and ad26.cov2.s and coronavac had the lowest levels , indicating that moderna and novavax vaccines have the best outcome [ 51 ] . the study also indicated the concern about the length of immunity received from vaccinations because there was a significant loss to the levels of neutralizing_antibodies 250 days post_vaccination . for example , a 95 % efficacy vaccine would drop to 77 % , whereas an initial efficacy of 70 % would drop down to 33 % . in addition to time after vaccination , variants of the sars_cov_2 strain also decreased antibody neutralization [ 51 ] . all vaccines are known to have certain side_effects that consumers should be aware of before receiving their doses . most of the vaccines are associated with local or injection and systemic side_effects . local reactions include pain , swelling , and erythema at the injection sites . systemic effects , such as headaches , myalgia , fever , chills , and nausea , are mainly due to the body ’ s immune response . the specific side_effects of vaccines are listed in table 1 . as mentioned in the previous section , anti_sars_ cov_2 antibodies could exacerbate covid_19 through ade mechanism . previous respiratory_syncytial_virus and dengue virus vaccine studies revealed human clinical safety risks related to ade , resulting in failed vaccine trials . evidence from animal studies showed safety concerns of ade for sars_cov_2 vaccine development and antibody_based therapy . sars_cov_2 antibodies bound to fc receptors on macrophages and mast_cells may represent two different mechanisms for ade in patients , however , clinical data have not yet fully established a role for ade in human covid_19 pathology . in order to reduce the risks of ade from immunotherapies , induction or delivery of high doses of potent neutralizing_antibodies is preferred , as lower concentrations of non_neutralizing antibodies would be more likely to cause ade [ 23 , 25 ] . 3 strains of concern the rush to develop and administer vaccines started as a means to protect the public from the only known strain of sars_cov_2 that was ravaging the population at the time , especially in highly populated areas . in the time since vaccines were developed in 2021 , numerous new strains of sars_cov_2 have emerged and spiked public health concerns . on may 31 , 2021 , who announces simple , easy_to_say labels for sars_cov_2 variants of interest and concern , using letters of the greek alphabet ( e.g. , alpha , beta , gamma , and delta ) . these new strains include but not limited to d614g , b.1.1.7 ( also known as alpha , voc_202012/01 , or 201/501y .v1 ) , b.1.526 , b.1.351 ( also known as beta , or 501y .v2 ) , b.1.1.28.1 ( including p1 , also known as gamma ) , and b.1.617 . the common variant strains of sars_cov_2 are listed in table 2 . these strains contain various mutations , and many of which are localized to the s protein that has resulted in changes in viral behavior and pathogenesis such as alterations to rbd and escaping from natural immunity [ 52 ] . the emergence of variant strains is undoubtedly a great threat to the control of the covid_19 pandemic [ 53 ] . there is still 1044 current_medical_science_41 ( 6 ) :2021 much concern about the emerging and surrounding new viral strains of the virus , which are causing pandemic in particular countries and regions such as uk , south africa , and india [ 54 ] . we will discuss the virology and therapeutics of common variants . one of the first major mutations to the original sars_cov_2 viral genome sequence , a point_mutation of d614g in the s protein that resulted in the g614 strain , occurred early in the pandemic . this strain was originally found in germany and china in late january 2020 and eventually spread globally . the change in genome seemed to always be accompanied by three other mutations : a c_to_t mutation in the 5′ utr at position 241 , an analogous mutation of c_to_t mutation at position 3037 , and a c_to_t mutation at position 14 408 in the rna_dependent rna polymerase ( rdrp ) gene [ 55 , 56 ] . the mutation was found to both increase infectivity and viral replication within human tissue compared to the original d614 virus , although the increase in infectivity did not increase in lethality [ 8 , 55 , 57 ] . the higher infectivity is associated with an increase in affinity of the rbd from the acquired mutation , as glycine ( g ) instead of aspartic_acid ( d ) residue could allow for an increase in flexibility to the trimeric s protein structure and better affinity [ 8 ] . regarding the therapeutic effects on the mutant strain , studies showed that the pfizer_biontech bnt162b2 vaccine which was based on the original d614 sequence had a 1.7–2.0 decrease in neutralization , making it less effective [ 55 , 57 ] . the moderna mrna_1273 vaccine showed similar neutralization when compared to the original strain [ 58 ] .the pathologic b.1.1.7 ( also known as alpha , voc_202012/01 , or 201/501y .v1 ) was first noted in the uk in december , 2020 , but currently being detected in over 40 countries . this strain has 17 non_synonymous mutations , along with 8 s protein mutations and the d614g mutation . three out of the 8 s protein mutations are notable including a two_amino acid deletion at positions 69–70 , n501y , and p681h [ 59 ] . n501y has been shown to increase the rbd affinity to ace2 , similar to the d614g mutation . the moderna and novavax vaccines exhibited only a moderate reduction in neutralization of the b1.1.7 strain in vitro compared to the original strain [ 59 , 60 ] . b.1.526 strain was first identified in new york city in the u.s. in november 2020 . since its identification , the strain ’ s prevalence has increased exponentially in the state of new york and its surrounding areas . mutations in the b.1.526 strain include e484k ( the most notable ) and s447n in the s protein along with 5 common others including l5f , t95i , d253g , d614g , and a701v [ 61 ] . annavajhala et al tested the effectiveness of monoclonal antibodies against a pseudo_viral coronavirus model containing each of the mutations , including e484k and s477n . the results showed that the b.1.526 strain containing s477n mutation showed little to no antigenic impact and was fully neutralized . however , several antibodies were impaired and overall neutralization was decreased when targeting the e484k mutation [ 62 ] . this impairment of viral neutralization was also seen with convalescent serum ( also known as “ survivor ’ s plasma ” containing antibodies or special proteins generated by the body ’ s immune system to the novel coronavirus infection ) when tested against the table 2 common variant strains of sars_cov_2 new who namestrain nameother name ( s ) major mutation sites first reported placefirst reported timetherapeutics d614g d614g german ,

e484k strain . it has been found that the e484 mutation can be altered by a k , q , or p amino_acid change , all of which have been shown to decrease neutralization in serum by limiting the antibody binding to the rbd [ 63 ] . when tested against moderna and pfizer_biontech vaccinated sera , their efficacy was not affected by the s477n mutation , but did show a decrease in neutralization on the e484k mutation [ 61 ] , the b.1.351 strain ( also known as beta , or 501y . v2 ) was first identified in south africa in late 2020 and was the predominant strain in the region at that time ( however the delta strain has been seeing an increase in prevalence within that region and globally as of recently ) . this variant has multiple mutations in the s protein including k417n , e484k , and n501y . as seen with the b.1.526 strain , having the e484k mutation allows for decreased neutralization , along with the n501y mutation discussed in the u.k strain . collectively , when all three mutations are present there is an increase in the infectivity of the virus , as studied in a pseudovirus model . additionally , the b.1351 strain demonstrated a decrease in the neutralization of both serum convalescent sera and pfizer_vaccinated sera [ 64 ] . moderna vaccine showed a decrease in neutralization against but was still able to uphold immunity to the b.1.351 strain [ 65 ] . two more recently published clinical_trial studies evaluated the efficacy of two vaccines , chadox1_ncov_19 ( a replication_deficient chimpanzee adenovirus vector vaccine ) and nvx_cov2373 ( an adjuvanted , recombinant nano_particle vaccine ) , against the b.1.1351 variant . the chadox1_ncov_19 showed no efficacy against mild_to_moderate covid_19 while nvx_cov2373 had an efficacy of 49.4 % against symptomatic covid_19 caused by b.1.351 variant [ 66 , 67 ] . the b.1.1.28 strain was originally identified in rio de janeiro , brazil in february 2020 . this strain contains the e484k mutation as mentioned in the b.1.526 strain [ 68 ] . sapkal et al found that the covaxin vaccine ( developed in india ) significantly increased the neutralization against this strain [ 69 ] . however , the pfizer_biontech and moderna vaccinated sera showed a decrease in neutralization of this strain [ 70 ] . the p1 strain ( also known as gamma , or 20j/501y .v3 ) belongs to the b.1.1.28 strain lineage , initially found in travelers that came to japan from brazil , but has multiple mutations making it to be more severe ( e.g , increased infectivity and decreased antibody neutralization ) . the p1 strain has three notable mutations within the rbd , k417t , e484k , and n501y , similar to that of the b . 1.351 strain identified in south africa [ 71 ] . a study tested responses of the p1 strain to various monoclonal antibodies and the results showed that ( 1 ) the adagio antibodies were able to completely neutralize p1 ; ( 2 ) a significant decrease in neutralization with most of the antibodies ; and ( 3 ) bamlanivimab had no neutralization ability [ 72 ] . similar to b . 1.351 , the pfizer_biontech and moderna vaccinated sera showed a decrease in neutralization of p1 strain [ 70 ] . the most recent variant of significance is the b . 1.617 strain found in india in late 2020 . it has developed into three subvariants , with the main variant being b.1.617.2 ( also known as delta ) . the strain possesses common signature mutations consisting of d111d ( synonymous substitution ) , g142d , l452r , e484q , d614g , and p681r , in the s protein . within the rbd , three concerning mutations include l452r and e484q , along with p681r in the furin cleavage site [ 73 ] . these mutations could result in increased ace2 binding as seen with other strains that contain the mutations , as well as potentially increase the rate of s1_s2 cleavage resulting in better transmissibility . a recent study illustrated that strains that contain l452r mutation can escape host immune response by eluding both hla_restricted and humoral immune responses [ 74 ] . another study found that the l452r mutations had a decreased response to vaccines ( pfizer_biontech and moderna ) compared to the original strain [ 75 ] . new mutations have been shown to affect the current therapeutics , indicating the current vaccines can become inefficient in given circumstances . thus , despite the tremendous efforts being made in vaccine development and distribution , long_term management like new vaccine development and additional booster ( e.g. , yearly ) shots may be necessary to eradicate the current pandemic . 4 antiviral drugs vaccine development has been a major focus for the prevention of sars_cov_2 in a healthy population . other therapeutic approaches including antiviral drugs have been utilized and researched to treat patients with covid_19 . major antiviral drugs that have been tested for covid_19 treatment include remdesivir , hydroxychloroquine , and lopinavir_ritonavir . however , hydroxychlorquine and lopinavir_ritonavir are not utilized as often due to their controversial effectiveness . the u.s. fda initially approved for eua of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for hospitalized patients on april 24 , 2020 , but revoked on june 15 , 2020 due to cardiovascular complications . the clinical_trial of lopinavir_ritonavir was revoked by who on july 4 , 2020 due to lack of mortality reduction [ 76 , 77 ] . there are also monoclonal antibodies which are being developed for the treatment . the major antiviral drugs are listed in table 3 . remdesivir is an antiviral drug that acts as a nucleoside analog inhibiting the viral rdrp of coronaviruses like sars_cov_2 [ 78 ] . on october 22 , 2020 , the u.s. fda approved the antiviral drug remdesivir ( brand name : veklury ) for use in adults 1046 current_medical_science_41 ( 6 ) :2021 and pediatric patients ( 12 years_of_age and older and weighing at least 40 kg ) for the treatment of covid_19 requiring hospitalization . it also remains authorized for emergency use for the treatment of suspected or laboratory_confirmed covid_19 in hospitalized pediatric patients weighing 3.5 kg ( about 7.7 pounds ) to less than 40 kg or hospitalized pediatric patients less than 12 years_of_age weighing at least 3.5 kg . the clinical study showed that remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults who were hospitalized with covid_19 and had evidence of lower respiratory_tract infection [ 79 ] . as some data suggested the benefits of remdesivir are not sufficient to consistently treat severe cases , therefore , trials of some new antiviral drugs are in the pipeline of development , including plitidepsin , zotatafin , and molnupiravir . plitidepsin is an antiviral drug that targets eukaryotic translation elongation_factor 1 alpha 1 ( eef1a ) , which encodes an isoform of the alpha subunit of the elongation factor_1 complex , responsible for the enzymatic delivery of aminoacyl trnas to the ribosome [ 80 , 81 ] . the study conducted by white et al found that plitidepsin was more potent in inhibiting sars_cov_2 in human cells than remdesivir [ 80 ] . on march 5 , 2021 , the spanish pharmaceutical company pharmamar started a clinical phase ⅲ trial for plitidepsin for individuals with moderate to severe symptoms . a similar drug called zotatifin interacts with eukaryotic initiation factor_4a ( eif4a ) , which is important for the binding of the mrna to the 40s ribosomal subunit . zotatifin will be in a phase ⅰ clinical_trial for treating symptoms in moderate to severely ill patients starting may 2021 by effector therapeutics , inc. ( usa ) . molnupiravir ( also known as eidd_2801/mk_ 4482 ) , a prodrug of the antiviral ribonucleoside analog β_d_n4_hydroxycytidine ( eidd_1931 ) , has been used in the past for the treatment of rna viruses including influenza and coronaviruses [ 81 , 82 ] . after molnupiravir enters the cells , it is converted to eidd_1931 , an active oral bioavailable ribonucleoside analog which is incorporated into viral rna and interrupts the process of viral replication [ 82 ] . the drug is currently being tested in phase ⅱ clinical_trial with covid_19 patients by merck sharp & dohme corp . currently , there are over 50 different monoclonal antibodies ( mab ) being developed and tested as therapeutics to treat sars_cov_2 . the antibodies are generally designed to target the s protein of sars_cov_2 , but other options are to target the microenvironment to regulate local immune responses to viral infection . many mabs are in clinical_trials , such as lenzilumab ( humanigen inc. ) which is a mab targeting the granulocyte_macrophage colony_stimulating factor ( gm_csf ) , and risankizumab ( collaboration between boehringer_ingelheim and abbvie ) which is a mab that targets il_23 . in this paper , we will discuss three u.s. fda approved antibodies including bamlanivimab and etesevimab ( eli lily and co. ) , and regn_cov2 ( regeneron , inc. ) . these three mabs all target the s protein of sars_cov_2 . in november 2020 , the u.s. fda approved eua for bamlanivimab alone to be used for treatment for mild to severe cases of sars_cov_2 . however , in april of 2021 , the eua was revoked against bamlanivimab if given as a single drug due to increased resistance , but it can still be used with other drugs under eua . etesevimab has similar mechanisms to bamlanivimab , where they both bind overlapping epitopes in the rbd of the s protein . the combined therapy of bamlanivimab and etesevimab was approved by the fda for eua on february 9 , 2021 for patients presenting with moderate covid_19 symptoms . in a randomized clinical_trial with mild table 3 antiviral drugs drug name other name ( s ) mechanism of action approval status in treating covid_19 remdesivir veklury ( trade name ) inhibiting the viral rna_dependent rna polymerase ( rdrp ) u.s. fda approved for eua in adults and pediatric patients with severe symptoms on october 20 , 2020 . plitidepsin aplidin targeting eef1a

virusphase ⅱ/ⅲ_clinical trials , conducted by merck sharp & dohme corp. bamlanivimab ly_cov555 mab that targets overlapping epitopes in the rbd of s protein , preventing viral entranceu.s . fda approved for eua in november 2020 , revoked as single drug use in april 2021 , still in eua in combination therapies etesevimab ly_cov016 , also known as js016mab that targets overlapping epitopes in the rbd of s protein , preventing viral entranceu.s . fda approved for eua for combinational therapy of bamlanivimab and etesevimab on february 9 , 2021 , for mild to moderate patients regn_cov2 casirivimab & imdevimabmab that targets non_overlapping epitopes in the rbd of the s protein , preventing viral entranceu.s . fda approved for eua on november 21 , 2020 , to treat mild to moderate patients . 1047 current_medical_science_41 ( 6 ) :2021 to moderate cases , bamlanivimab monotherapy showed no decrease in viral load , but when given in combination with etesevimab , there was a significant drop in viral load [ 83 ] . the other drug , regn_cov2 , is a mab cocktail produced by regeneron that contains two mabs : casirivimab and imdevimab . it targets the non_ overlapping epitopes in the rbd of the s protein , thus preventing viral entrance to host_cells . the u.s. fda approved the cocktail eua to treat mild to moderate cases in adults and pediatric patients on november 21 , 2020 [ 84 ] . 5 discussion despite the rapid development of vaccines and ongoing clinical_trials for other therapeutics , the sars_cov_2_infection is still a large public health concern . generally , patients who had previously been infected with sars_cov_2 will have antibodies against the virus 6 months after initial infection . however , given the emergence of new strains and the uncertainty of the long_term reinfection rates and complications of the disease , manufacturers such as pfizer and moderna suggest that vaccinated individuals may need an additional third dose , which will also possibly lead to yearly doses of covid_19 vaccinations . as discussed earlier , many of the new strains demonstrate qualities that allow them to defend themselves against complete neutralization from convalescent or vaccination sera . this poses a long_term battle as the current vaccinations are constructed from the original genome of sars_cov_2 . this can also be a potential cause of reinfection by different strains . a study by li et al tested vaccinated sera in a rhesus macaques model against the d614g , b.1.1.7 , and b.1351 strains [ 85 ] . the results showed normal neutralization of d614g and b.1.1.7 strains , but with a decrease in neutralization of the b.1351 despite being vaccinated . although vaccines have been available across the globe , the distribution of vaccines has been biased towards wealthier nations ( with ~60 % of countries distributing 75 % of available vaccines in 2021 ) , and some other countries only received a very limited number of vaccines ( https : //coronavirus.jhu.edu/vaccines/us_states , fig . 4 ) [ 86 ] . for example , as of june 21 , 2021 , mali has only vaccinated 0.2 % of its population ( https : //coronavirus.jhu.edu/region/mali or https : //graphics.reuters.com/world_coronavirus_tracker_and_maps/vaccination_rollout_and_access/ ) . to stop the spread of pandemic , assistance must be available to all countries . the covid_19 vaccines global access ( cov ax ) , a worldwide initiative aimed at equitable access to covid_19 vaccines directed by who and other organizations , coordinates international resources to enable low_to_middle_income countries equitable access to covid_19 tests , therapies , and vaccines . multiple surveillance methods have been used to monitor the spread of sars_cov_2 . the nasopharynx and nasal swabs pcr tests have been the dominant form of testing . however , this method of testing is highly reliable on clinician and patient sampling techniques . other techniques that are currently being used to test and monitor spread include saliva pcr tests , serology tests , and wastewater surveillance . newer forms of testing for sars_cov_2 are in the process of being developed , including utilizing crispr_cas9 technology . the crispr_cas9 system uses endonucleases to cut viral dna or rna and amplify the sequences to allow for rapid , accurate , and inexpensive detection of the virus . the newly discovered leopard_crispr_cas9 fig . 4 vaccination progress across the world as of june 21 , 2021 ( https : //coronavirus.jhu.edu/vaccines/us_states ) the map shows the covid_19 vaccines are not equitably distributed around the world . developed countries are vaccinating their populations faster than less developed countries . m : million people fully_vaccinated 50 m 100 m 200 m 200 m 1048 current_medical_science_41 ( 6 ) :2021 technology can trace viral origin through the use of multiple guide rnas simultaneously . this technology will potentially allow physicians to not only detect sars_cov_2 in patients , but also determine the specific strain ( s ) that cause the infection [ 87 , 88 ] . the u.s. cdc provides timely updating information related to covid_19 including travel guidance , variants , vaccines , and testing , which can be accessed at https : //www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019_ncov/index.html . regardless of the vaccines or drugs that become available to combat covid_19 , it is still essential that individuals take the proper precautions and follow the guidelines set in place to prevent further spread . in conclusion , sars_cov_2 has caused millions of deaths worldwide since its origin in early 2020 and is still wreaking havoc . the development of vaccines against viruses has helped limit the spread but has yet to eradicate it . this is partially due to the rapid mutagenesis of the virus , resulting in dominant strains with qualities that allow an increase in infectivity , ability to escape host immune response , decreased neutralization from vaccination , and potentially demonstrate an increase in lethality . for the pandemic to be stopped , there are needs to be continuous development of new therapeutics as well as continuous monitoring and sequencing of the sars_cov_2 virus over time . there is also need to improve distribution and guidelines for receiving the vaccinations .

xxia @ uottawa.ca 2ottawa institute of systems_biology , university of ottawa , ottawa , on k1h 8m5 , canada abstract : the design of pﬁzer/biontech and moderna mrna vaccines involves many different types of optimizations . proper optimization of vaccine mrna can reduce dosage required for each injection leading to more efﬁcient immunization programs . the mrna components of the vaccine need to have a 50_utr to load ribosomes efﬁciently onto the mrna for translation initiation , optimized codon usage for efﬁcient translation elongation , and optimal stop_codon for efﬁcient translation termination . both 50_utr and the downstream 30_utr should be optimized for mrna stability . the replacement of uridine by n1_methylpseudourinine ( y ) complicates some of these optimization processes because yis more versatile in wobbling than u . different optimizations can conﬂict with each other , and compromises would need to be made . i highlight the similarities and differences between pﬁzer/biontech and moderna mrna vaccines and discuss the advantage and disadvantage of each to facilitate future vaccine improvement . in particular , i point out a few optimizations in the design of the two mrna vaccines that have not been performed properly . keywords : sars_cov_2 ; mrna vaccine ; translation initiation ; codon optimization ; translation termination ; rna secondary structure ; rna stability 1 . introduction the two most frequently used sars_cov_2 vaccines , from pﬁzer/biontech [ 1 ] and moderna [ 2 ] , respectively , are both mrna vaccines . the sequence of pﬁzer/biontech ’ s bnt_162b2 is publicly available [ 3 ] , and the sequence of moderna ’ s mrna_1273 has recently been sequenced [ 4 ] . both mrna encodes the same s_2p protein [ 5,6 ] which differ from the spike_protein in the reference sars_cov_2 genome ( nc_045512 ) by two amino_acids , i.e. , amino_acids kv at sites 986 and 987 were replaced by pp to stabilize the resulting spike_protein in the prefusion state to train the host immune system to recognize the virus before its entry into the host_cell [ 7,8 ] . while the pﬁzer/biontech ’ s bnt162b2 mrna and moderna ’ s mrna_1273 share the same amino_acid sequence , they differ in many other ways , such as the design of 50_utr , codon optimization and 30_utr . translation initiation is typically the limiting step in translation , and its efﬁciency depends heavily on how rapidly the 50_utr can load ribosome onto the mrna [ 9 ] . translation elongation becomes rate_limiting when translation initiation is highly efﬁcient [ 10,11 ] . optimization of vaccine mrna for efﬁcient translation can decrease the copies of vaccine mrna needed to be carried into host_cells . as mammalian host_cells attack unmodiﬁed exogeneous rna [ 12,13 ] , all u nucleotides were replaced by n1_methylpseudouridine ( y ) [ 14,15 ] . however , ywobbles more in base_ pairing than u and can pair not only with a and g , but also , to a lesser extent , with c and u [ 16 ] . this is likely to increase misreading of a codon by a near_cognate trna . when nucleotide u in stop_codons was replaced by y , the rate of misreading of a stop_codon by a near_cognate trnas increased [ 17 ] . such readthrough events would not only decrease the number of immunogenic proteins , but also produce a longer protein of unknown fate with potentially deleterious effects . vaccines 2021 ,9 , 734. https : //doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9070734 https : //www.mdpi.com/journal/vaccines vaccines 2021 ,9 , 734 2 of 19 i performed a detailed dissection and critical evaluation of different optimization strategies of vaccine mrna from pﬁzer/biontech and moderna , from 50_utr to 30_utr , and highlight their similarity and differences . by using genomic and transcriptomic data , i pointed out a few inappropriately performed optimizations in the design of the two mrna vaccines . the objective is to facilitate the development of better strategies in vaccine mrna optimization in the future . 2 . materials and methods 2.1 . sequence data much of mrna optimization is based on contrast between highly_expressed protein_ coding genes and average protein_coding genes . ribosomal protein genes have been used throughout the paper as representatives of functionally important and highly_expressed_genes . hugo gene nomenclature committee ( hgnc at https : //www.genenames.org/ , accessed on 20 june 2021 ) lists 35 small and 54 large ribosomal protein genes . these genes were then downloaded from www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene ( accessed on 20 june 2021 ) . some of the downloaded genes are pseudogenes , e.g. , rpl21 and two rpl7a isoforms . rps4y2 is also annotated as a pseudogene in nc_000024 . these genes , as well as some other genes that are homologous to ribosomal protein genes but are not expressed in most tissues ( rpl10l , rpl39l , and rpl3l ) , were excluded . only ubiquitously expressed ribosomal protein genes ( 33 rps and 50 rpl genes ) were included . the supplemental sequence ﬁle in fasta format ( rp_longest_isoform_ubiquitous.fas ) contains the longest splice isoform for each ribosomal protein genes . some results in the paper include all splice isoforms so that total_number of coding_sequences ( cdss ) is greater than 83 . human genomes ( chromosomes 1 to 22 , x and y ( nc_000001_nc_000024 ) were downloaded from ncbi . the 11,327 annotated cdss ( including splicing isoforms ) in chromosome 1 ( chr01 ) were used as a representative set of human genes to contrast against ribosomal protein genes ( as a representative set of highly_expressed_genes ) . the nucleotide frequencies of all introns in chromosomes 18 to 22 ( 0.2640 , 0.2178 , 0.2262 , and 0.2920 for a , c , g and t , respectively ) were used as a proxy of background frequencies in computing position weight matrix . the reference genomes of sars_cov and sars_cov_2 ( nc_004718 and nc_045512 , respectively ) were downloaded from genbank , and so were other related coronaviruses isolated from bats ( mn996532 , mg772933 , mg772934 ) . the coronavirus sequence isolated from pangolin ( pangolin|epi_isl_410721|2019 ) was downloaded from gisaid . the vaccine mrna bnt_162b2 is publicly available [ 3 ] . the sequence of mrna_1273 was taken from jeong et al . [ 4 ] , and should be considered putative . however , the 50_utr of this putative sequence is identical to one of the 50_utr sequences ( seq id no 181 ) in a moderna patent [ 18 ] . similarly , the 30_utr of this sequence is identical to one of the 30_utr sequences ( seq id no 21 ) in another moderna patent [ 19 ] , except that the seventh triplet is uag in the putative sequence instead of aug . in this context , it may be safe to assume that the putative sequence is the real mrna_1273 . 2.2 . tissue_speciﬁc gene expression as the two mrna vaccines are administered through muscle injection , it is relevant to characterize features of highly_expressed muscle genes . the human protein atlas ( www.proteinatlas.org , accessed on 20 june 2021 ) contains tissue_speciﬁc gene expression data . the rna_tissue_consensus.tsv.zip ﬁle from the site contains gene expression data from 62 tissues . gene expression of 19,670 human protein_coding genes ( including 13 mito_ chondrial protein_coding genes ) were characterized in skeletal_muscle . i sorted the genes by their expression and took the top 50 as representative genes highly_expressed in the skeletal_muscle . i included a supplemental ﬁle heg50_muscle.fas that contains the coding_sequences of the longest isoform of these 50 highly_expressed skeletal_muscle genes . data for figure 1 are from three independent quantiﬁcations of tissue_speciﬁc gene ex_ pression represented by three ﬁles in the human protein atlas : proteinatlas.tsv , rna_tissue_ vaccines 2021 ,9 , 734 3 of 19 gtex.tsv and rna_tissue_fantom.tsv . the tissue_speciﬁc expression of the zinc ﬁnger antivi_ ral protein zap ( nc3hav1 and its long form zc3hav1l ) were extracted from each of the three ﬁles and plotted in figure 1 . the near absence of zap in muscle cells suggests that spike mrnas in the vaccine injected into muscle cells will not be subject to zap_mediated rna degradation . vaccines 2021 , 9 , x 3 of 22 coding_sequences of the longest

samples ( e.g. , gc_26/66 corresponding to sar ﬁle srr11886744.sra ) and poor_quality samples ( e.g. , gc_55/68 corresponding to srr11886743.sra ) . i downloaded srr11886744.sra and analyzed subgenomic mrna for the spike_protein naturally pro_ duced by proliferating sars_cov_2 . the 50_utr from naturally produced spike mrna was derived from the analysis . vaccines 2021 ,9 , 734 4 of 19 3 . results and discussion 3.1 . codon optimization for translation elongation efﬁciency there are two levels of codon optimization . the ﬁrst involves compound codon families . for example , sars_2_s in the reference_genome ( nc_045512 ) contains 42 arg residues , of which 30 are encoded by agr codons and only 12 are encoded by cgn codons ( s refcolumn in table 1 ) . this avoidance of cgn codons makes evolutionary sense given that the host zinc ﬁnger antiviral proteins ( zap , gene name zc3hav1 ) target cpg dinucleotides in viral rna and recruit cellular rna degradation complexes to degrade the viral rna genome [ 27–29 ] . however , human genes use cgn more frequently than agr codons for encoding arg . among the ribosomal protein genes ( 33 rps and 50 rpl ) known to be highly_expressed , 64.2 % of the arg residues are encoded by cgn codons . bnt_162b2 and mrna_1273 reduced agr codons by 8 and 28 , respectively , with the corresponding increase in cgn codons . table 1 . optimization of

nc_045512 ) and bnt_162b2 . one might ask if the resulting increase in cpg dinucleotides would result in rapid degradation of the vaccine mrna after being delivered into the host_cell through the zap_ mediated rna degradation pathway [ 27–29 ] . this is not a concern with the intramuscular injection because , according to three sets of gene expression data from human protein atlas at http : //www.proteinatlas.org ( accessed on 20 june 2021 ) [ 30 ] , zap is almost absent in skeletal_muscle ( figure 1 ) . this highlights one advantage of mrna vaccines because it has many different but convenient routes for vaccine administration , including subcutaneous , intramuscular , intradermal , intratracheal , intravenous and intraperitoneal routes [ 31 ] . the high cpg in the vaccine mrna provides two additional beneﬁts . first , gc_rich mrnas tend to be more stable than au_rich mrnas [ 32 ] . second , in the unlikely case when the vaccine mrnas were recombined into a sars_cov_2 virus , the result would not be a virus with an optimized spike_protein gene , but a segment of cpg_rich rna that would be targeted by host zap for degradation . the compound codon family for leu is optimized similarly . highly_expressed human ribosomal protein genes encode 81 % of leu by cun codons . for this reason , almost all uur codons for leu were recoded to cun codons in both vaccine mrnas ( table 1 ) . the compound codon family for ser introduces a new twist . both codon subfamilies are used vaccines 2021 ,9 , 734 5 of 19 roughly equally for encoding ser . however , it is easier to optimize the agy subfamily because agc is clearly the preferred codon over agu . note that mutation bias would have favored u_ending codons because the frequency of u in introns is higher than that of c ( 0.2920 for u and 0.2178 for c , table 1 ) , but highly_expressed ribosome protein genes prefer agc over agu ( 144 for agc and 95 for agu , table 1 ) . in contrast , the ucn subfamily has both ucc and ucu used frequently . for this reason , many ser codons ucn were recoded to agc in the vaccine mrnas , especially in mrna_1273 ( table 1 ) . the second level of codon optimization is within_family optimization . two strategies have been used . the ﬁrst , referred to hereafter as the fundamentalist strategy , is simply to replace all codons by the major codon . which codon is a major codon depends conceptually on two criteria : ( 1 ) the codon is preferred by highly_expressed_genes , and ( 2 ) it is decoded by the most abundant trna . however , superﬁcial application of these two criteria can lead to mistakes . i will take the cgn codon family for arg to show an incorrect optimization of the two mrna vaccines . the designers of both vaccines considered cgg as the optimal_codon in the cgn codon family and recoded almost all cgn codons to cgg . this choice of cgg as the optimal_codon seemingly resulted from application of both criteria above . first , the emboss [ 33 ] compilation of codon usage , which is frequently used in codon optimization , shows that cgg is used slightly more frequently than cgc . second , cgg seems to have more trna decoding it than other synonymous cgn codons . a human genome contains seven trnaarg/acggenes ( where superscripted acg is the anticodon , with a deaminated to inosine i ) to decode cgy codons , four trnaarg/ccggenes to decode cgg codons and six trnaarg/ucggenes to decode cga and cgg ( through wobble pairing at third codon site ) . assuming that trna abundance is well correlated with trna gene copy number , which is true for saccharomyces_cerevisiae [ 34 ] but not known for other eukaryotes , one can infer that cgg is translated by more trnas genes ( four trnaarg/ccggenes six trnaarg/ucggenes ) than other codons and therefore is the major codon based on the two criteria . the two vaccines recoded nearly all cgn codons to cgg ( table 1 ) . the reasoning above involving trna gene copy number is problematic . nearly half of human trna genes are not expressed [ 35 ] , so we can not use trna gene copy number as a proxy of trna abundance in the cellular trna pool . for this reason , codon preference by highly_expressed_genes relative to lowly expressed_genes is a better operational criterion for codon optimization . the codon compilation of human genes in emboss [ 33 ] was done in 1993 and 1994 and did not aim to include only the highly_expressed , so the slightly higher usage of cgg than cgc may simply be due to mutation bias ( the frequency for nucleotide g is consistently higher than that of c in human introns ) . there are two lines of evidence suggesting that cgg is not the optimal_codon . the ﬁrst involves the codon usage of human ribosomal protein genes ( “ rp ” in table 1 ) which are known to be highly_expressed . these genes prefer cgc codons ( table 1 ) . the second and more direct evidence is from codon usage of genes highly_expressed in skeletal_muscle cells ( which are relevant here because the vaccine mrna is injected and carried by the lipid nanoparticles into skeletal_muscle cells to be translated , although vaccine mrna could also be carried to some other tissues ) . i chose 50 genes most highly_expressed in skeletal muscles from the consensus expression data set in human protein atlas at http : //www.proteinatlas.org ( accessed on 20 june 2021 ) [ 30 ] , but excluded those with cdss with fewer than 300 codons . the remaining 26 genes ( table 2 ) , including the most muscle_speciﬁc genes such as titin ( ttn ) , actin ( acta1 ) and myosin ( myh1 ) , use cgc codons signiﬁcantly more than cgg codons ( paired sample t_test , t= 3.075 , df = 25 , p= 0.0034 , 2_tailed test ) . therefore , the cgc codon preferred by ribosomal protein genes are also preferred by highly_expressed muscle genes . other protein_coding genes that are highly_expressed are the two isoforms of human elongation_factor 1 ( hef1a1 and hef1a2 ) , and poly ( a ) _binding protein ( hp abpc1 ) . they also use more cgc than cgg ( cgc : cgg are 3:0 for hef1a1 , 8:6 for hef1a2 , and 14:4 for hp abpc1 ) . these multiple lines vaccines 2021 ,9 , 734 6 of 19 of evidence suggest that cgc is a better codon than cgg . the designers of the mrna vaccines ( especially mrna_1273 , table 1 ) chose a wrong codon as the optimal_codon . table 2 . usage of cgc and cgg codons in the most highly_expressed_genes in skeletal muscles . only those cdss with the number of codons ( n codon ) greater than 300 were included . gene cgc cgg n codon gene cgc cgg n codon ttn 140 120

families are straightforward . for 2_fold r_ending codons , background mutation bias , as reﬂected by nucleotide frequencies of introns in human genome , favors a_ending codons , but ribosomal protein genes consistently favor g_ending codons in every 2_fold r_ending codon family . consequently , g_ending codons were taken as the optimal_codon in the two mrna vaccines ( table 3 for gar codons encoding glu ) . for 2_fold y_ending codons , the background mutation favors u_ending codons , but ribosomal protein genes favor c_ending codons , so c_ending codon is the optimal_codon . there is another reason for recoding u_ending codons to c_ending codons . all u nucleotides in the two mrna vaccines were replaced by n1_methylpseudouridines ( y ) which can wobble with all for nucleotides and , therefore , should not be used in 2_fold codon families . for example , ga yencoding asp could pair with the anticodon of trnaglu leading to nonsynonymous substitutions . c_ending codons do not have this problem , which serves as another reason for recoding u_ending codons to c_ending codons . table 3 . codon optimization of asp ( d ) codons in the two vaccine mrnas . the column headers are identical to those in table 1 . aa codon rp bkground s ref sbnt_162b2 smrna_1273 e gaa 331 0.2640 34 14 0 e gag 426 0.2262 14 34 48 the second strategy in codon optimization , referred to hereafter as the liberal strategy , is simply a less extreme version of the fundamentalist strategy that replaces all synonymous codons by the optimal_codon . suppose a synonymous codon family nnr with nng decoded by trna_1 and nna decoded by trna_2 . additionally , suppose that trna_1 is twice as abundant as trna_2 and that highly_expressed_genes favor nng codon over nna codon . the fundamentalist strategy is to replace all codons by nng . the liberal strategy is based on the following rationale . when a cell is full of mrna with nng codons , trna_1 will be under such a high demand that it may become less available than trna_2 , although there are twice as many trna_1 in the cell than trna_2 . for this reason , it might be more optimal to keep some codons decoded by trna_2 . these two strategies are exempliﬁed by the codon optimization involving gar codons encoding glu ( table 3 ) . the sars_cov_2 reference_genome ( nc_045512 ) has 34 gaa codons and 14 gag codons in its spike_protein gene . moderna ’ s mrna_1273 has taken the fundamentalist strategy and replaced all gaa codons by gag . in contrast , vaccines 2021 ,9 , 734 7 of 19 pﬁzer/biontech ’ s bnt_162b2 took the liberal strategy , and left 14 gaa codons unchanged ( table 3 ) . moderna has consistently applied the fundamentalist strategy for all codon families in mrna_1273 , whereas pﬁzer/biontech has consistently used the liberal strategy in codon optimization for bnt_162b2 . there is no systematic evaluation of these two codon optimization strategies in translation efﬁciency . given the difference in dosage ( 100 g with mrna_1273 and 30 g with bnt_162b2 ) and the equivalence in efﬁcacy , one may assume that an injection of pﬁzer/biontech or moderna vaccine produces the same num_ ber of the encoded spike_proteins . this would imply that mrna in the pﬁzer/biontech vaccine on average likely produces about 3.3 times as many proteins as an mrna in the moderna vaccine . the codon optimization applied to bnt_162b2 and mrna_1273 leads to a much in_ creased codon adaptation index ( cai ) [ 21,22 ] and index of translation efﬁciency ( i te ) [ 11,36 ] for the two vaccine mrnas . the s gene from natural coronaviruses have cai < 0.7 for their spike_protein cds , but the two codon_optimized spike cdss have cai equal to 0.94925 and 0.97939 , respectively ( table 4 ) . i teis a generalized cai taking into consideration of background mutation bias [ 11 ] . its values are similarly much higher in the two vaccine mrnas than in natural viruses . the maximum cai and i tevalues are 1 . table 4 .

cai and i tevalues for bnt_162b2 than mrna_1273 might give an impression that bnt_162b2 is less codon_optimized than mrna_1273 . this is not necessarily true . as i mentioned before , mrna_1273 was codon_optimized with the fundamentalist strategy ( i.e. , replacing all or almost all synonymous codons by the optimal_codon ) , whereas bnt_162b2 was optimized with the liberal strategy which is less extreme than the ﬁrst . the fundamentalist strategy will necessarily generate higher cai or i te values than the liberal strategy . however , the liberal strategy might lead to more efﬁcient translation elongation if there are too many codons demanding the most abundant trna , as i discussed before . 3.2 . codon optimization for translation accuracy the codon optimization in the previous section suffers from the lack of consideration for translation accuracy [ 36,37 ] . take asn codons aac and aau in e. coli for example . aac is a major codon ( heavily used by highly_expressed_genes and decoded by the most abundant isoacceptor trna ) whereas aau is a rarely used minor codon . highly_expressed e. coli genes use aac almost exclusively to encode asn , so one could argue that the overuse of aac is driven by selection for translation efﬁciency . however , aac and aau also differ in misreading rate , in particular by trnalys , which ideally should decode only aaa and aag codons but does misread aac and aau , leading to asn replaced by lys . this misreading error rate is six times greater for aau than for aac , with the error ratio consistently maintained in different experimental settings , e.g. , under both asn_starved and non_starved conditions [ 38 ] , or with streptomycin used to inhibit translation [ 39 ] . vaccines 2021 ,9 , 734 8 of 19 therefore , the overuse of aac by highly_expressed e. coli genes could be driven either by selection for increased translation efﬁciency or increased translation accuracy or both . akashi [ 37 ] attempted to disentangle the effect of selection on translation efﬁciency and accuracy . he classiﬁed amino_acid sites into conserved sites ( assumed to be functionally important ) and variable sites ( assumed to be of limited importance ) . if codon adaptation is due to selection for translation efﬁciency , then all codons in the gene should be subject to similar selection regardless of whether the codon is in a functionally important or unimportant site . in contrast , if codon adaptation is driven by selection for translation accuracy , then the selection is stronger in functionally important sites than in functionally unimportant sites . this implies greater select effect on functionally important codon sites than functionally unimportant codon sites . he found greater codon adaptation in conserved amino_acid sites than in variable amino_acid sites . this is consistent with his inference that the difference between the conserved and variable sites has resulted from selection for accuracy . the observation , however , is also consistent with selection for translation efﬁciency . take lysine codons ( aaa and aag ) and glutamate codons ( gaa and gag ) for example . suppose that aaa codon can be decoded more efﬁciently than aag , and gag decoded more efﬁciently than gaa . additionally , suppose that a highly_expressed ancestral gene has evolved strong codon adaptation with lysine coded mainly by aaa and glutamate coded mainly by gag . now , some lysine sites might happen to experience nonsynonymous substitutions from aaa to gaa . these sites are now designated as variable ( functionally unimportant ) sites and are occupied by a minor codon gaa . this would result in an association between “ poor codon adaptation ” and variable ( functionally unimportant ) sites that has little to do with translation accuracy . akashi [ 37 ] discussed this problem but did not provide a deﬁnitive solution . there are two approaches to optimize codon usage for accuracy . the ﬁrst is to empiri_ cally characterize the decoding error rate for each synonymous codon in skeletal_muscle cells , and to choose the codon with the lowest error rate . for mrna to be translated in e. coli , then recoding aau to aac would increase accuracy because aac has a misreading error six times smaller than aau . an alternative is again to follow the codon usage of functionally important and highly_expressed_genes , such as ribosomal proteins or highly_expressed genes in skeletal_muscle cells in table 2 . it is important for vaccine mrna to be translated accurately because misincorporation of the wrong amino_acids would confuse our immune system in target recognition . 3.3 . translation initiation signal optimum codon usage without efﬁcient translation initiation does not increase protein production [ 10,11 ] because translation initiation is often the rate_limiting step . efﬁcient translation initiation in mammalian species depends mainly on two factors [ 40,41 ] : ( 1 ) the kozak consensus [ 42–44 ] , and ( 2 ) the secondary structure that may embed the kozak consensus to obscure these essential translation initiation signals [ 9,41,45 ] . these factors contribute to the efﬁciency of ribosomes being properly positioned at start_codon to transit from translation initiation to elongation . i disregard the nature of start_codon as a relevant factor contributing to translation initiation efﬁciency because there is little variation in start_codon usage in mammalian genes . for example , among 11,327 annotated protein_coding genes and their splice isoforms in human chromosome 1 ( chr01 , nc_000001.11 ) , only ﬁve genes ( oaz3 , fndc5 , fndc5 , rnf187 and wdr26 ) have one of its isoforms featuring a non_aug start_codon . 3.3.1 . human translation initiation consensus the kozak consensus for mammalian genes that enhances translation initiation is gccrcc aug g [ 40,46 ] , where aug is the start_codon . to corroborate this consensus , i show in table 5 the site_speciﬁc nucleotide frequencies ﬂanking the start_codon aug for all protein_coding genes ( including isoforms ) from human chr01 . the associated position vaccines 2021 ,9 ,

aug , for two good reasons . first , while the _3r ( site 4 in the ﬁrst column of table 5 ) has been demonstrated repeatedly to enhance translation initiation , the effect of +4g ( site 10 in table 5 ) , as well as nucleotides downstream , on translation initiation has been inconclusive [ 46,49–51 ] . the preponderance of +4g was explained by the amino_acid constraint hypothesis [ 52,53 ] as follows . about 60 % of the proteins experience n_terminal methionine excision ( nme ) which requires a small and nonpolar amino_acid such as alanine and glycine . alanine is encoded by gcn and glycine by ggn , leading to a high frequency of g at the +4 site . there is little evidence that +4g and downstream nucleotides contribute to translation initiation . second , the second amino_acid in the spike_protein is phenylalanine , which ensures that nme does not happen . changing it to gcg ( encoding alanine ) would result in nme leading to unpredictable changes in the s protein . for these reasons , the ﬁrst codon is not considered in kozak consensus optimization . 3.3.2 . 50_utr and secondary structure flanking the start_codon 50_utr serves two key functions : to stabilize mrna and to facilitate scanning by small ribosome subunit to localize the start_codon . there are three strategies in optimizing 50_utr in mrna vaccine development . the ﬁrst is simply to take the 50_utr of a highly_expressed human gene , such as the 50_utr of human _globin genes . the second is to use the native mrna for sars_2_s . these ﬁrst two strategies assume that the optimization done by natural_selection can be extrapolated to translation in muscle cells . the third is by systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment ( selex ) that has been used in optimizing the 30_utr [ 54 ] but could be adapted for optimizing 50_utr as well . for designing a vaccine against a pandemic , rapid development is the most important , so the ﬁrst two approaches seem most reasonable . the design of the 50_utr of bnt162b2 took the ﬁrst approach by incorporating the 50_utr of human _globin ( 50_utr is identical between human hba1 and hba2 ) with a minor modiﬁcation of the kozak consensus ( figure 2a ) . as shown before in table 5 , the optimal kozak consensus is gccaccaug which is used to replace the original accaug ( figure 2a ) . this follows naturally from earlier approaches of designing the 30_utr by vaccines 2021 ,9 , 734 10 of 19 incorporating regulatory elements for stability from human _globin and _globin [ 13 ] . one additional advantage of using the 50_utr of a highly_expressed human gene is that such 50_utrs are almost invariably devoid of upstream aug that could interfere with translation initiation . vaccines 2021 , 9 , x 11 of 22 it is not known if such a secondary structure in the 5 ’ _utr of mrna_1273 ( figure 2c ) would hamper the cap_dependent scanning for the start_codon and result in less effi_ cient translation . however , the 5 ’ _utr of bnt162b2 derived from 5 ’ _utr of the human α_globin gene ( figure 2 ) does appear to be superior over mrna_1273 in this aspect . as i mentioned before , mrna_1273 also has a problem in codon optimization ( e.g. , excessive use of cgg that is not an optimal_codon ) . these factors might jointly impact negatively the translation efficiency of mrna_1273 and contribute to the requirement of a high dos_ age of moderna vaccine ( 100 μg/dose ) relative to that of pfizer/biontech vaccine ( 30 μg/dose ) . when an mrna is not translated efficiently , more of it is needed to produce the same amount of the encoded spike_protein . mrna_1273cataaaccctggcgcgctcgcggcccggc actcttctggtccccacagactcagagagaaccc __ _accatg ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

( c ) visualization of the secondary structure embedding the start_codon in mrna_1273 . as demonstrated in previous studies on translation initiation in yeast [ 55 ] and in mouse cell lines [ 56 ] , stable secondary structure in the 50_utr before or ﬂanking the start_codon decreases protein production . however , secondary structure downstream of the start_codon tend to enhance recognition of start codons by eukaryotic ribosomes [ 57 ] . bnt162b2 has little secondary structure ﬂanking the start_codon that is located at mid_window sites 55–57 ( figure 2b ) . however , moderna ’ s mrna_1273 is peculiar in having a secondary structure ﬂanking the start_codon ( figure 2b ) that is visualized in figure 2c . the mfe for the 40 nucleotides with the start_codon in the middle is _12.3 for mrna_1273 at 37c . the long stem in figure 2 has a g/u base_pair to close the stem . g/u base_pairs are usually too weak to close a stem . however , all u nucleotides in the mrna vaccines have been modiﬁed to n1_methyl_pseudouridine ( y ) [ 14 ] to reduce immune reaction towards mrna and to increase protein production [ 2,13,58 ] . g/ybase pairs are expected to be stronger than g/u base_pairs [ 16 ] . moderna has developed many alternative 50_utrs and 30_utr sequences listed in two patents [ 18,19 ] . the 50_utr in moderna ’ s mrna_1273 is v1_utr ( seq id no 181 ) [ 18 ] . it is made of two elements . the ﬁrst element is seq id no 1 in a list of 16,120 sequences in one patent [ 19 ] . this element is followed by a gc_rich second element ccccggcgcc [ 18 ] , just before the kozak consensus accaug . this gc_rich element , and the secondary structure it contributes to ( figure 2c ) may increase mrna stability and translation accuracy by reducing leaky scanning [ 18 ] . it is not known if such a secondary structure in the 50_utr of mrna_1273 ( figure 2c ) would hamper the cap_dependent scanning for the start_codon and result in less efﬁcient translation . however , the 50_utr of bnt162b2 derived from 50_utr of the human _globin gene ( figure 2 ) does appear to be superior over mrna_1273 in this aspect . as i mentioned vaccines 2021 ,9 , 734 11 of 19 before , mrna_1273 also has a problem in codon optimization ( e.g. , excessive use of cgg that is not an optimal_codon ) . these factors might jointly impact negatively the translation efﬁciency of mrna_1273 and contribute to the requirement of a high dosage of moderna vaccine ( 100 g/dose ) relative to that of pﬁzer/biontech vaccine ( 30 g/dose ) . when an mrna is not translated efﬁciently , more of it is needed to produce the same amount of the encoded spike_protein . one should be cautious in making the interpretation above concerning the secondary structure in figure 2c ) . some genes known to be highly_expressed have comparable mfe values in the 40 nucleotides with the start_codon in the middle . for example , 8.6 % of ribosomal protein genes ( including different isoforms ) have mfe values for the 40 nt windowd equal or smaller than  12.3 ( figure 3 ) . in other words , the secondary structure of these 8.6 % of ribosomal protein genes are equally stable or even more stable than that of mrna_1723 . therefore , the secondary structure in mrna_1273 ( figure 2 ) does not necessarily imply low translation efﬁciency . vaccines 2021 , 9 , x 12 of 22 051015202530 _17.4 _16.675 _15.95

good_quality sample of gc_26/66 with long reads [ 26 ] . this information might be useful in developing a therapeutic agent targeting trs3 to disrupt this discontinuous transcription . note that the native sars_2_s does not have an optimal kozak consensus of gccac_ caug , although it does have _3a which was deemed particularly important for translation initiation [ 40 ] . this is typical of genes in mammalian viruses . as argued by nakamoto [ 62 ] , when translation initiation sequence does not have a good kozak consensus in mammals ( or shine_dalgarno sequence in prokaryotes ) , a start_codon not obstructed by secondary structure becomes crucial for efﬁcient translation initiation . the sequence in figure 4c does not form secondary structure embedding the start_codon . 3.4 . translation termination signal in contrast to most prokaryotic species with two release factors ( rf1 decoding uaa and uag and rf2 decoding uaa and uga ) , eukaryotic release factor erf1 recognizes all three stop_codons [ 63,64 ] . however , this fact does not mean that the three stop_codons are equally optimal in eukaryotes . in fact , multiple lines of evidence suggest much difference in termination efﬁciency and accuracy among the three stop_codons . pﬁzer/biontech ’ s vaccines 2021 ,9 , 734 13 of 19 bnt162b2 mrna features two consecutive uga stop_codons . moderna ’ s mrna_1273 uses all three different stop_codons ugauaauag . are these the optimal arrangement ? 3.4.1 . efﬁciency and accuracy in translation termination termination efﬁciency is measured by the number of stop_codons decoded per unit time , and termination accuracy is measured by proportion of stop_codons correctly decoded in contrast to misreading by near_cognate trnas ( nc_trnas ) . the efﬁciency is often operationally measured experimentally by the release of a trna_linked model peptide on a ribosome complex in the presence of erf [ 63–65 ] . these studies suggest that uaa ( especially uaaa ) is more efﬁcient than other stop signals . the accuracy is operationally measured by the frequency of misreading of stop_codons by nc_trnas ( leaky termination ) . the rate of misreading stop_codons by tr_ nas has been measured for several bacterial species . uga is the leakiest of the three , with a readthrough frequency of at least 10 2to 10 3insalmonella typhimurium [ 66 ] and e. coli [ 67,68 ] . readthrough also occurs with stop_codons uag and uaa in bacte_ ria [ 69,70 ] , but at a lower rate . natural uag readthrough frequency is mostly within the range of 1.110 4to 710 3 , depending on the nature of the downstream nu_ cleotides [ 70–73 ] . the readthrough of uaa occurs at frequencies from 9 10 4to less than 110 5 [ 70 ] . highly_expressed_genes in diverse bacterial species strongly prefer uaa codons even in strongly gc_rich genomes with an overwhelming majority of stop_codons being uga [ 74,75 ] . different lines of empirical_evidence suggest uaa as the best stop_codon in eukary_ otes . first , the binding afﬁnity to erf1 is in the order of uaa > uga and uag [ 63,64 ] , suggesting that uaa is a more efﬁcient stop_codon than the other two . second , highly_expressed_genes in the yeast prefer uaa stop_codons [ 76 ] . empirical data in table 6 shows that highly_expressed mammalian genes also prefer uaa stop_codons . this is illustrated by contrasting all coding_sequences ( cdss ) on human chromosome 1 ( chr01 ) and human ribo_ somal protein genes ( rp ) that are known to be highly_expressed . the total of 11,327 cdss on chr01 is divided into two groups based on gc_content ( p cg : proportion of c and g in each cds ) . cdss in the low_cg group has p cgbetween 0.3 and 0.52 and cds in the high_cg group has p cgbetween 0.52 and 0.8 ( table 6 ) . uaa is used more frequently in the low_cg group than the high gc group , which is expected from mutation bias . however , chr01 and rp differ dramatically in uaa usage . both low_cg and high_cg group of genes in chr01 feature uga as the most frequent stop_codon . in contrast , rp genes exhibit a strong preference for uaa stop_codon ( table 6 ) . in this context , the termination signal ugauga in pﬁzer/biontech ’ s bnt162b2 and ugauaauag in moderna ’ s mrna_1273 may not be the optimal choice . table 6 . highly_expressed_genes prefer uaa stop_codon . human chromosome 1 ( chr01 ) contains 11,327 coding_sequences ( cdss , including splicing isoforms ) , which is divided into two groups based on proportion of nucleotides c and g ( p cg ) in the cds . stop_codon usage of these cdss change with pcgand differ from highly_expressed ribosomal protein genes ( rp , including splicing isoforms ) . group p cg n uaa uag uga chr010.52 5940 0.3828 0.2130 0.4042 > 0.52 5387 0.1916 0.2437 0.5647 rp0.52 347 0.7406 0.1527 0.1066 > 0.52 309 0.4563 0.2201 0.3236 one might think that the consecutive stop_codons in the two vaccine mrnas would offer a fail_safe mechanism , given the readthrough observed in the translation of not only yeast genes but also mammalian genes [ 77–79 ] . for example , human mdh1 has a uga stop_codon that is often translated as trp ( encoded by ugg ) or arg ( encoded by cga and other synonymous codons ) leading to an extended protein without frameshifting [ 77 ] . an additional in_frame stop_codon is expected to prevent the production of such unintended vaccines 2021 ,9 , 734 14 of 19 proteins with potentially deleterious effects [ 80 ] . however , in many cases , misreading uga stop_codons in prokaryotes is associated with a +1 frameshift [ 81–84 ] . such frameshifting also occurs in eukaryotes , such as the mammalian az1 gene with a stop_codon context ugau [ 85 ] , where uga is the stop_codon followed by a u at the +4 site . the ﬁrst u in the stop_codon in translating az1 mrna is often skipped when the concentration of polyamines is high , resulting in the ribosome reading gau as the next codon [ 85 ] . with such a +1 frameshifting , a downstream in_frame stop_codon can not serve as a fail_safe mechanism . uga is a poor choice of a stop_codon , and ugau in pﬁzer/biontech and moderna mrna vaccines could be even worse . 3.4.2 . tetranucleotide termination signal it has long been recognized that the translation termination signal is more than a stop_codon [ 86,87 ] , leading to an early proposal of tetranucleotide stop signal including the downstream +4 site [ 63,65,87,88 ] . the previous section has already alluded to the association of +4u and +1 frameshift . recent structural studies of mammalian erf1 [ 89–91 ] offered a mechanistic explanation for this tetranucleotide stop signal . the lysine ( k ) in an niks motif in erf1 interacts with nucleotide u at the ﬁrst site of a stop_codon to induce a conformational distortion so that , instead of the three nucleotides of a stop_codon occupying the a site , four nucleotides ( stop_codon plus the +4 site ) are squeezed into the a site , with glycine g626 of erf1 in close physical proximity to the +4 site . nonpolar amino_acids typically do not form hydrogen bonds with bases in nucleic_acids . however , glycine is an exception . based on the observed contact between amino_acids in a protein and bases in dna , glycine interacts far more favorably with purine than with pyrimidine [ 92 ] . if one may extrapolate this observation from dna to rna , then one would predict that g626 would favor purine at the +4 site , i.e. , a purine at +4 site is more likely to enhance the stop signal by interacting with g626 in erf1 than a pyrimidine . similar predictions can also be made with respect to +5 or +6 sites which , however , have their effect far less consistent than the +4 site on translation termination [ 65 ] . it is important to test the prediction concerning the +4 site because , if a purine at the +4 site indeed favors translation termination , then the two mrna vaccines , with a +4u ( actually a +4 y ) , do not have a good termination signal . we can again test the prediction by contrasting nucleotide usage at +4 site between human chr01 genes rp genes . functionally important and highly_expressed_genes such as rp genes are expected to evolve strong termination signals . if a purine at the +4 site is beneﬁcial , then rp genes should on average be more likely to have +4r than chr01 genes . there are 11,327 annotated chr01 cdss ( including isoforms ) , and consequently 11,327 stop_codons . these includes 3306 uaa , 2578 uag and 5443 stop_codons ( table 7 ) . the percentage of +4a , +4c , +4g , and +4u for each of the three stop_codons are shown in cdss terminating with uaa , uag and uga ( table 7 ) . these percentage values make sense when contrasted with those for the 760 annotated cdss ( including isoforms ) of highly_expressed rp genes . the hypothesis that highly_expressed_genes favor +4r is strongly supported , which is consistent across all three stop_codons ( table 7 ) . the functionally important and highly_expressed rp genes use +4r much more than an average gene represented by chr01 genes . the difference , when tested by a likelihood_ratio test , is highly signiﬁcant ( likelihood_ratio chi_square = 931.0514 , df = 17 , p < 0.000001 ) . the strong preference of +4r in highly_expressed rp genes ( table 7 ) is consistent with other lines of empirical_evidence . stop_codon uga with a +4c is most prone to readthrough in mammalian genes , especially in the context of uga cua [ 77,78 ] . both ugac and ugau lead to frequent selenocysteine incorporation [ 65 ] , suggesting poor decoding of uga as a stop_codon with +4y . in mammalian genes , the effect of the +4 site is consistent among all three different stop_codons in experimental studies , with termination efﬁciency of uaar > > uaay , uagr > > uagy and ugar > > ugay both in vitro and in vivo [ 65 ] . for example , the termination efﬁciency of ugac is < 20 % of uaaa [ 65 ] . table 7 suggests that these early experimental results obtained with speciﬁc sequence vaccines 2021 ,9 , 734 15 of 19 constructs and translation systems are general and real . in short , the optimal stop signal should be uaaa instead of ugau/uagu/uaau in the two mrna vaccines . table 7

replacement of u by n1_methylpseudo_ uridine ( y ) in the two vaccine mrnas . to alleviate host_cells to attack exogeneous vaccine mrna as foreign rna [ 13,58 ] , all uridines in the mrna vaccines were replaced by y [ 2,14 ] . therefore , the stop signals are ygayga instead of ugauga in pﬁzer/biontech ’ s vac__cine , and ygayaayag instead of ugauaauag in moderna ’ s vaccine . as yis more promiscuous in base_pairing than u and can pair with both a and g and , to a less extent , with c and u [ 16 ] , stop_codons become more prone to misreading by trnas [ 17 ] . it is for this reason that both mrna vaccines use consecutive stop_codons as a fail_safe mechanism , with the hope that no frameshifting occurs when the ﬁrst stop_codon fails . however , ugau is known to cause a +1 frameshifting . it is reasonable to infer that ygaymay be the same . i have mentioned before that mammalian az1 gene with a stop_codon context ugau is prone to polyamine_induced +1 frameshifting [ 85 ] . such a +1 frameshifting defeats the purpose of having multiple stop_codons as a fail_safe mechanism . 3.5 . the 30_utr of mrna vaccines i have previously mentioned different approaches for optimizing 50_utr and 30_ utr . given sufﬁcient time , the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrich_ ment ( selex ) [ 54 ] should be the preferred method . however , in an emergency , the alternative approach of borrowing from nature could be more efﬁcient . the 50_utr of the pﬁzer/biontech vaccine mrna incorporates the 50_utr of a human _globin gene ( figure 2a ) , which makes sense because _globin mrnas are translated very efﬁciently . the same approach of borrowing from nature has been used for designing 30_utr of therapeutic mrnas , e.g. , by incorporating stability regulatory elements from human _globin and _globin genes [ 13 ] . these stability regulatory elements often form rna_ protein complexes to stabilize mrna [ 93–97 ] . the 50_utr and 30_utr of globin genes , when ligated to other mrnas , can confer stability to these mrnas [ 54,98,99 ] . moderna ’ s mrna_1273 “ pasted ” the 110_nt 30_utr of human _globin gene ( hba1 ) between the last stop_codon and a poly ( a ) tail.the design of the 30_utr of the pﬁzer/biontech mrna vaccine is a combination of selex and borrowing from nature . the objective is to ﬁnd naturally occurring rna segments that perform better than the 30_utr of human _globin mrna [ 54 ] . two rna segments outperform other alternatives through the selex opti_ mization protocol [ 54 ] . one of them is from the human mitochondrial 12s rrna ( mtrnr1 ) , and the other segment is from human aes/tle5 gene . as these two rna segments were found to have the lowest number of predicted binding sites for mirnas and the highest hybridization energies [ 54 ] , two c ! u mutations were introduced in the aes segment to further increase the binding_energy ( from mfe =  37 to 39.3 at 37c , my calculation from dambe ) . for pﬁzer/biontech ’ s mrna vaccine , the aes segment of 136 nt with the two c ! ymutations was pasted right after two trinucleotides following the second stop_codon . the mtrnr1 segment of 139 nt was pasted immediately after . this heuristic and vaccines 2021 ,9 , 734 16 of 19 empirical approach of borrowing from nature is perhaps more efﬁcient than alternatives in an emergency . 4 . conclusions the two widely used mrna vaccines , one from pﬁzer/biontech and the other from moderna , have been optimized by borrowing from highly_expressed human genes . however , there are several inappropriate optimizations . i highlighted and illustrated such cases in the hope that the conceptual_framework would facilitate the design of not only vaccines , but also other therapeutic mrnas . supplementary materials : the

rapid communication next_generation covid_19 vaccines should take efficiency of distribution into consideration khaled aboulfotouh,1,2zhengrong cui,1,3and robert o. williams iii1,3 received 25 october 2020 ; accepted 24 february 2021 ; published_online 9 april 2021 abstract . the dire need for safe and effective coronavirus disease ( covid_19 ) vaccines is met with many vaccine candidates being evaluated in pre_clinical and clinical studies . the covid_19 vaccine candidates currently in phase 3 or phase 2/3 clinical_trials as well as those that recently received emergency_use_authorization ( eua ) from the united_states food and drug administration ( fda ) and/or other regulatory agencies worldwide require either cold ( i.e. , 2 –8°c ) or even freezing temperatures as low as −70°c for storage and distribution . thus , existing cold_chain will struggle to support both the standard national immunization programs and covid_19 vaccination . the requirement for cold_chain is now a major challenge towards worldwide rapid mass vaccination against covid_19 . in this commentary , we stress that thermostabilizing technologies are available to enable cold chain_free vaccine storage and distribution , as well as potential needle_free vaccination . signi_ﬁcant efforts on thermostabilizing technologies must now be applied on next_generation covid_19 vaccines for more cost_effective worldwide mass vaccination and covid_19 eradication . key words : sars_cov_2 ; dry powder ; thermostability ; cold_chain ; vaccine . introduction the novel severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome coronavi_ rus 2 ( sars_cov_2 ) is the etiological agent of covid_19 that has been declared a pandemic by the world_health_organization ( who ) on march 11 , 2020 ( 1,2 ) . sars_cov_2 has a single_stranded positive_sense rna genome that encodes structural proteins as well as nonstructural and accessory proteins ( 3,4 ) . the critical structural proteins are ( i ) spike ( s ) protein that mediates the entry of the virus into the host_cells , ( ii ) nucleocapsid protein that protects the viral rna against the surrounding host_cells , ( iii ) membrane_protein that enables the viral rna to bind to the inner surface of the host_cell membrane , and ( iv ) envelop protein ( 1 ) . the s glycoprotein has two functional subunits , namely , s1 that mediates cellular attachment and s2 that mediates viral and cellular_membrane fusion ( 5 ) . the s1 receptor_ binding domain ( rbd ) mediates the binding of sars_cov_2 to the angiotensin_converting enzyme ( ace2 ) host_cell receptor followed by viral internalization into the cells ( 1,5 ) . ace2 receptor is expressed in many tissues in the body , including type ii pneumocytes ( i.e. , surface epithelial cells of the alveoli ) , enterocytes , and oral mucosal epithelium ( 6 ) . the leading cause of covid_19 mortality was reported to be the acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome , which is initiated by the infection of lung epithelium by sars_cov_2 viruses and the activation of alveolar macrophages ( 1 ) . immune_mediated cytokine storm and rnaemia also con_ tribute to the severity of covid_19 ( 6,7 ) . as of january 31 , 2021 , the who of ﬁcial data showed 102,083,344 con ﬁrmed covid_19 cases including 2,209,195 deaths ( 8 ) . the trans_ mission of sars_cov_2 from asymptomatic individuals is the main contributing factor to the large number of covid_19 cases ( 3 ) . thus , the development of prophylactic vaccines is the key in stopping sars_cov_2 transmission and infection and ultimately eradicating covid_19 . many covid_19 vaccine candidates are being evaluated in different phases of clinical_trials and some have already been granted emergency_use_authorization ( eua ) . however , almost all these candidates require distribution and storage in either cold ( i.e. , 2 –8°c ) or ultra_cold temperatures ( i.e. , −20°c or −70°c ) . according to the who , vaccines should be stored in a system that maintains them in good condition . this system is referred to as the “ cold_chain ” and is designated to keep vaccines within the who recommended temperature ranges ( i.e. , 2 to 8°c or −15 to −25°c ) . astoundingly , cold_chain accounts for ~80 % of the cost of vaccination programs in the developing_countries ( 9 ) . cold_chain failure can result in signi_ﬁcant losses of vaccines that are considered lifesaving in the case of pandemics such as1division of molecular pharmaceutics and drug delivery , college of pharmacy , the university of texas at austin , austin , texas 78712 , usa . 2department of pharmaceutics , faculty of pharmacy , assiut univer_ sity , assiut , 71526 , egypt . 3to whom correspondence should be addressed .

association of pharmaceutical scientists covid_19 . for instance , 1900 doses of the moderna ’ s covid_19 vaccine were ruined when a freezer was acciden_tally unplugged at a veteran ’ s hospital in boston ( 10 ) . additionally , temperature_controlled supply_chain is a major obstacle towards rapid and ef ﬁcient distribution of vaccine . in this commentary , we discuss various covid_19 vaccine candidates that had received eua or are in phase 3 or phase 2/3 clinical_trials with the main emphasis on theircold chain requirements and propose that vaccine developers and manufacturers must now consider the stability of their vaccine candidates at ambient temperatures or at least at coldtemperatures ( i.e. , 2 –8°c ) in order to achieve rapid and efﬁcient vaccine dist ribution and thus mass vaccination without signi_ﬁcantly compromising the existing national immunization programs . t his can be achieved via the selection of the appropriate technology as well as the optimization of vaccine formulation . tutorial on covid_19 vaccines in phase 3 or phase 2/3 clinical_trials , with or withouteua vaccine design considers the selection of proper virus_ derived antigens , the vaccine technologies , and the route of administration ( 11 ) . as of january 26 , 2021 , there were 63 covid_19 vaccine candidates in clinical evaluation and anadditional 173 in preclinical evaluation ( 12 ) . a remarkable feature of the covid_19 vaccine development landscape is the array of novel as well as traditional technology platforms being evaluated , including nucleic_acid ( i.e. , mrna anddna ) , recombinant protein , viral vector , bacterial vector , live attenuated , virus_like particles ( vlps ) , and inactivated virus_based vaccines ( 13–15 ) . the technology used to develop the vaccine determines the potency of vaccine antigens , the need for immune adjuvant , and the type of protective immunity induced ( 11 ) . table isummarizes various covid_19 vaccine candidates in phase 3 or phase 2/3 clinical_trials . according to the who , as of january 26 , 2021 , there were 22 vaccine candidates belonging to seven differentplatforms in phase 3 or phase 2/3 clinical_trials around theworld ( 12 ) . adenovirus vector_based sars_cov_2 vaccines azd1222 ( i.e. , chadox1_s ) was developed by research_ ers at oxford university and licensed by astrazeneca ( 38 ) . the results of phase 1/2 , single_blind , randomized , controlled clinical_trial ( i.e. , nct04324606 ) showed that azd1222 wassafe , well tolerated , and induced both cellular and humoral immune responses in all participants ( 39 ) . the interim_analysis of four clinical studies ( i.e. , two phase 1/2 studies insouth africa ( i.e. , nct04444674 ) and united_kingdom ( uk ) ( i.e. , nct04324606 ) , a phase 2/3 study in uk ( i.e. , nct04400838 ) , and a phase 3 study in brazil ( i.e. , isrctn89951424 ) ) showed an ef_ﬁcacy of 70.4 % ( 40 ) . on december 30 , 2020 , the uk medicines_and_healthcare_products_regulatory_agency ( mhra ) granted eua for adz1222 vaccine . the vaccine is currently authorized for usein the uk and many other countries worldwide ( 41 ) . ad26.cov2.s , janssen ’ s covid_19 vaccine , is ad26 vector_based , and cansinobio ’ s covid_19 vaccine is ad5vector_based ( 42,43 ) . sputnik v , the vaccine candidate devel_ oped by the gamaleya research institute of epidemiology andmicrobiology , is unique in that it is based on ad5 and ad26 for heterologous priming and boosting ( 17 ) . it elicited strong humoral and cellular immune responses in phase 1/2 clinicaltrials ( i.e. , nct04437875 and nct04436471 ) ( 17 ) . inactivated sars_cov_2_based vaccines coronavac is an inactivated sars_cov_2 vaccine can_ didate ( 27 ) . coronavac provided either partial or complete protection against sars_cov_2 in rhesus macaques without eliciting antibody_dependent enhancement of virus infection ( 44 ) , which was previously found in animals immunized with severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome coronavirus ( sars_cov ) or middle_east respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus ( mers_cov ) vaccine candidates prepared with the inactivated wholevirus or the full_length s proteins , respectively ( 45,46 ) . the results of phase 1/2 clinical_trial ( i.e. , nct04352608 ) showed that coronavac is well tolerated and can induce sars_cov_2_speci ﬁc humoral immune responses in healthy adults ( 18 –59 years_of_age ) . these ﬁndings supported the initiation of phase 3 clinical_trial ( i.e. , nct04582344 ) . two other inactivated sars_cov_2 vaccine candidates currently in phase 3 clinical_trials were developed by the wuhan institute of biological products and the beijinginstitute of biological products ( i.e. , bbibp_corv ) , indepen_dently , in coalition with sinopharm ( 12,28 ) . the results of phase1/2 clinical_trials showed that both vaccine candidates are well tolerated and can elicit humoral immune responsesagainst sars_cov_2 rapidly in healthy adults ( 47,48 ) . all of them had been granted eua in china and/or many other countries , and public availability of data from phase 3 clinicaltrials is pending ( 49 ) . bharat biotech , indian council of medical research , and the national institute of virology developed a whole_virion inactivated sars_cov_2 vaccine called covaxin ™ ( also known as bbv152 ) , which is also currently evaluated in a phase 3 clinical study ( i.e. , nct04641481 ) ( 31 ) . cova_ xin™was granted “ for restricted use in emergency situation in public interest as an abundant precaution , in clinical_trial mode ” in india on january 2 , 2021 ( 50 ) . sars_cov_2 mrna vaccines another platform for the development of covid_19 vaccine candidates is the mrna . messenger_rna can acceler_ ate the development of covid_19 vaccine because it combinesthe ease of manufacturing and ef ﬁcient modi ﬁcation of the encoded antigen ( 51 ) . messenger rna_based vaccines can induce strong immune responses by generating potent neutral_izing antibodies and activating cd8 +and cd4+t cells , while reducing the potential risks of infection and mutagenesis ( 52 ) . finally , mrna vaccines can be potentially rapidly modi ﬁed to address any new sars_cov_2 mutations ( 53,54 ) . both mod_ erna ’ s mrna_1273 and p ﬁzer/biontech ’ s bnt162b2 vaccine candidates were recently granted eua by the fda . moderna ’ s mrna_1273 vaccine is a lipid nanoparticle_ encapsulated mrna ( 20 ) . encapsulation of the mrna within the lipid nanoparticles provides the mrna protection against enzymatic degradation , facilitates its uptake by target126 page 2 of 15 aaps_pharmscitech ( 2021 ) 22 : 126 table i . summary of covid_19 vaccine candidates in phase 3 or phase 2/3 clinical_trials platform vaccine

however , 21 % of participants who received the 250 μg dose showed one or more severe adverse_events ( 20 ) . this phase 1 clinical_trial was expanded to test mrna_1273 in older population ( i.e.,56–70 or≥71 years_of_age ) at a dose of either 25 μg or 100 μg ( 56 ) . older population showed mild to moderate adverse_events . the 100_ μg dose induced high binding and neutraliz_ ing antibody titers as compared to the 25_ μg dose , and thus , it was selected for further evaluation in a large phase 3 clinical_trial ( i.e. , nct04470427 ) ( 56 ) . subjects who received mod_ erna ’ s mrna_1273 vaccine retained high levels of neutraliz_ ing anti_sars_cov_2 antibodies for 119 days after the ﬁrst vaccination . however , memory b and t cell responses to mrna_1273 vaccine are not yet delineated ( 57 ) . moderna ’ s mrna_1273 vaccine received eua from the fda and the european medicines agency ( ema ) on december 18 , 2020 , and january 6 , 2021 , respectively . pﬁzer and biontech launched their bnt162 ( i.e. , comirnaty® ) mrna_based vaccine candidate by comparing four vaccine candidates in an umbrella_type clinical_trial toselect a single vaccine candidate and dose level for a criticalglobal safety and ef_ﬁcacy trial ( 21 ) . two vaccine candidates ( i.e. , bnt162b1 and bnt162b2 ) showed superior safety and immune responses . both bnt162b1 and bnt162b2 are lipidnanoparticle_encapsulated nucleoside_modi ﬁed mrnas that encode trimerized sars_cov_2 rbd of the s glycoprotein and the full_length s glycoprotein , respectively ( 21,58 ) . the preliminary results of phase 1/2 clinical_trial showed a favorable overall tolerability pro ﬁle for the bnt162b2 in terms of less systemic reactogenicity , and it was thus selectedfor the large_scale phase 2/3 trial ( i.e. , nct04368728 ) tofurther evaluate its safety and ef_ﬁcacy ( 21 ) . bnt162b2 received eua from the fda on december 11 , 2020 , and from the european commission on december 21 , 2020 , following the ema recommendation of authorization . on december 31 , 2020 , the who granted its ﬁrst emergency use listing for bnt162b2 ( 59 ) . curevac ’ s cvncov is also a lipid nanoparticle_ encapsulated mrna vaccine encoding the full_length sars_cov_2 s glycoprotein ( 22 ) . the preliminary results of a phase 1 clinical study ( i.e. , nct04449276 ) showed the safety and tolerability of the cvncov vaccine in healthy volunteers 18 –60 years_of_age ( 60 ) . plasmid dna vaccine generally , dna vaccines have good stability pro ﬁles compared to mrna and protein subunit vaccines and no risk of infection compared to live_attenuated virus_based vaccines ( 13 ) . also , they are cost_effective , easily produced , and can induce durable immune responses ( 61 ) . zycov_d is a plasmid dna vaccine candidate developed by zydus cadila ( ahmedabad , india ) ( 33,62 ) . the results of phase 1/2 clinical_trial ( i.e. , ctri/2020/07/026352 ) have not been published , and a phase 3 clinical_trial ( i.e. , ctri/2021/01/030416 ) evaluating the ef_ﬁcacy and safety of zycov_d was initiated . zycov_d is given by intradermal injection using pharmajet.ino_4800 is another dna vaccine developed by inovio pharmaceuticals . the vaccine is injected intradermally fol_lowed by electroporation using cellectra ®.t h e electroporation generates a controlled electric ﬁeld at the site of injection to ameliorate the cellular uptake and thus theexpression of the dna plasmid ( 35 ) . data from phase 1 clinical_trial ( i.e. , nct04336410 ) demonstrated the safety and tolerability of ino_4800 , which also elicited humoral and/orcellular immune responses in all vaccinated subjects . ( 35 ) . recombinant protein subunit vaccines novavax ’ s nvx_cov2373 is adjuvanted with matrix_m1 . matrix_m1 is a mixture of two different formulations of saponin in cholesterol and phospholipid_based nanoparticle ( 63 ) . matrix_m1 has not yet been approved for human use . the safety and immunogenicity of nvx_cov2373 at a dose level of 5 μg and 25 μg with or without 50 μg of matrix_m1 adjuvant were evaluated in a randomized , placebo_controlled , phase 1/2 clinical_trial ( i.e. , nct04368988 ) . adjuvanted nvx_cov237 was found to be safe and elicited immune responses that exceeded the responses in covid_19 conva_lescent serum . matrix_m1 adjuvant spared the antigen dose and helped induce t helper 1 response ( 64 ) . anhui zhifei longcom biopharmaceutical and the institute of microbiol_ogy at the chinese academy of sciences developed anotherprotein subunit vaccine candidate which is currently in phase 3 clinical evaluation ( i.e. , chictr2000040153 ) . virus_like particles as of january 28 , 2021 , the who of ﬁcial data showed only one sars_cov_2 virus_like particle ( vlp ) covid_19vaccine candidate ( i.e. , covlp ) ( 12 ) . covlp is adjuvanted with the adjuvant system as03 that is composed of α_ tocopherol , squalene , and polysorbate 80 in an oil_in_wateremulsion ( 36 ) . none peer_reviewed data ( i.e. , preprint of a manuscript ) of phase 1 clinical_trial showed the tolerability and immunogenicity of covlp ( i.e. , eliciting strong humoraland cellular immune responses ) ( 65 ) . bcg vaccine bcg vaccine is a vaccine that was originally developed to prevent tuberculosis ( 66 ) . bcg can protect against multiple unrelated pathogens at least in part by the induction of innate immune memory ( i.e. , trained immunity ) . thus , ithas been hypothesized that bcg vaccination may protect against sars_cov_2_infection and/or reduce the severity of covid_19 ( 67 ) . the non_speci ﬁc protective effect of bcg vaccination against sars_cov_2_infection in high_risk popu_ lation is currently being evaluated in various phase 3 trials ( e.g. , healthcare workers [ nct04379336 ] , elderly individuals [ nct04475302 ] ) . ( predicted ) storage temperatures for covid_19 vaccines in phase 3 or phase 2/3 clinical_trials with or without eua generally , the costs of cold_chain storage and the logistics of vaccine distribution for subsequent administrationpage 5 of 15 126 aaps_pharmscitech ( 2021 ) 22 : 126 are major challenges encountered by the global vaccination programs ( 68 ) . vaccines lose their potency slowly over time , but elevated temperatures accelerate this potency loss process ( 69 ) . thus , vaccines are generally stored at cold or ultracold temperatures to maintain their stability and immunogenicity , which are reduced even at moderate temperatures ( 68 ) . as shown in table iiand figure 1 , vaccine heat sensitivity varies depending on the vaccine platform , and even vaccines basedon the same platform have different stability pro ﬁles depend_ ing on the manufacturer . almost all licensed inactivated virus vaccines are re_ quired to be stored in cold temperatures ( i.e. , 2 –8°c ) ( 83 ) . almost all inactivated virus_based covid_19 vaccine candi_ dates currently in phase 3 or phase 2/3 clinical_trials contain an aluminum salt adjuvant ( table i ) . therefore , they will most likely be stored at 2 –8°c . for example , sinovac biotechnology reported that its aluminum salt_adjuvanted , inactivated coronavac vaccine is stable for at least 5 monthsat 2 –8°c , 42 days at 25 oc and 28 days at 37oc ( 80 ) . matthias et al . reported that 14 –35 % of refrigerators or shipments have exposed vaccines to freezing temperatures ( 84 ) . accidentally exposing aluminum_adjuvanted vaccines to freezingtemperatures during transport or storage should be avoided , as the slow freezing ( due to breach of cold_chain ) causes theaggregation of the aluminum salt particulates and the loss of the vaccine potency ( 85 ) . the ad vector_based covid_19 vaccines currently in phase 3 clinical_trials most likely need to be stored at 2 –8°c or in freezing temperatures . for example , gamaleya ’ s ad5_ and ad26_based liquid vaccine is recommended to be storedfrozen in temperatures not higher than −18 oc , although gamaleya also has developed a freeze_dried form of the vaccine candidate , which is expected to be stable at 2 –8°c ( 17 ) . janssen ’ s ad26.cov2.s vaccine is based on the same advac platform as its zabdeno ebola vaccine ( i.e. , ad26.ze_ bov ) , which has been granted marketing authorization bythe ema . formulation advances have allowed long_term_storage of ad26_based vaccines at 2 –8°c ( 86 ) . for instance , zabdeno has a shelf_life of 4 years at −85 to−55°c . it should be transported frozen at −25 to−15°c and can be stored by distributors or end users in a freezer at −25 to −15°c for a period of up to 20 months . at 2 –8°c , it can be stored for up to 8 months ( 70 ) . therefore , it is expected that ad26.cov2.s table ii . a summary of the ( expected ) storage temperatures and shelf lives of selected covid_19 vaccine candidates

similar thermostability proﬁle , if a thermostabilizing technology will not be incorpo_ rated into the vaccine candidate ( 71 ) . cansinobio ’ s ad5_based covid_19 vaccine uses the same platform as its ad5_ebov ebola vaccine . the ﬁnal formulation of the ad5_ebov is in a lyophilized form and has a shelf_life of 12 months at 2 –8°c ( 73 ) . similarly , its ad5_ based covid_19 vaccine needs to be stored at 2 –8°c ( 87 ) . astrazeneca_oxford ’ s azd1222 ( i.e. , chadox1_s ) vaccine candidate uses the same platform as its chadox1_gngc riftvalley fever vaccine . a sugar_membrane thermostabilized chadox1_gngc vaccine can be stored at 45°c for 6 months , and its immunogenicity was not different from that after the vaccinewas stored at −80°c for the same period of time ( 88 ) . sugar_ membrane thermostabilizing tec hnology relies on the formulation of thermosensitive vaccines in a so lution of sucrose and trehalose which upon drying at room_temperature forms thin coats of sugarglass ( 88 ) . the embedded molecules can b e stabilized via restricting their mobility ( 89 ) . azd1222 has a shelf_life of 6 months at 2 –8°c . once the stopper of the vial has ﬁrst been punctured , it was recommended that the vaccine should be stored between 2 and 25°c and used with 6 h. apparently , the aforementioned sugar_ membrane thermostabilizing technology was not introduced in theadz1222 vaccine . messenger_rna vaccines are ﬁrst in class globally . the two mrna vaccines that have received eua need to bestored frozen . moderna ’ s mrna_1273 vaccine should be stored at −20°c , where it is potentially stable for 6 months . recently , moderna announce d data for stability testing showing that its candidate vaccine remains stable at 2 –8°c for 30 days and at 25°c for up to 12 h ( 75 ) . pﬁzer/biontech ’ s bnt162b2 mrna vaccine needs to be stored at −70°c , with a shelf_life of about 6 months . after the vaccine is thawed , itcan be stored at 2 –8°c for 5 days , and only 2 h at room_temperature ( 76,77 ) . curevac ’ s cvncov mrna vaccine is stable for 3 months at 5°c and 24 h at 25°c . the differentstability pro ﬁles of different mrna vaccines are likely due to the differences in their mrna lipid nanoparticle composi_ tions and properties ( 90 ) . novavax ’ s nvx_cov2373 adjuvanted with matrix_m1 adjuvant is expected to be stored at 2 –8°c ( 55 ) . matrix_m1adjuvant can be frozen or lyophilized , but it is not clear whether novavax will market a lyophilized powder form of its nvx_cov2373 ( 91 ) . finally , zydus cadila ’ s plasmid dna vaccine ( i.e. , zycov_d ) can be stored at 2 –8°c or even at 30°c for 3 months ( 82 ) . according to who recommendations , bcg vaccine should be stored and transported at 2 –8°c , although it can be stored at −25 to−15°c . to summarize , for the inactivated virus_based covid_ 19 vaccines adjuvanted with an aluminum salt and the nvx_cov2373 adjuvanted with matrix_m1 adjuvant , it is expected that cold temperatures of 2 –8°c are suf ﬁcient for their storage and transport . the aluminum_adjuvanted inactivatedvirus_based vaccines in liquid suspension are expected to besensitive to accidental freezing upon breach of cold_chain ( 92 ) . the nvx_cov2373_matrix_m1 vaccine may not be sensitive to freezing , because data from previous studies haveshown that the matrix_m1 ( or iscoms ) can be safely frozen ( 91 ) . the ad vector_based vaccine candidates are more likely to be stored at 2 −8°c . storing them frozen at −25 to−15°c , although not required , would signi_ﬁcantly increase their shelf_ lives . for the two mrna vaccines that have received eua , they must be kept frozen in order to have a few months ofshelf_life . for the bnt162b2 mrna vaccine , −70°c storage is required . curevac ’ s cvncov mrna vaccine is stable for 3 months at 5°c . covid_19 vaccines with fda eua and their distribution approaches pﬁzer/biontech ’ s and moderna ’ s mrna vaccines are ﬁrst in class vaccines that were developed at an unprece_ dented speed , but both of them require freezing temperatures for storage and distribution . their storage conditions andlogistics for their distribution are described below . pfizer/biontech ’ s bnt162b2 mrna vaccine on november 18 , 2020 , p ﬁzer and biontech announced the results of the ﬁnal ef_ﬁcacy analysis of their ongoing phase 3 clinical_trial . their mrna_based bnt162b2 vaccine fig . 1 . expected long_term_storage temperatures and shelf_lives of various covid_19 vaccine candidates in phase 3 or phase 2/3 clinical_trials . thermostable vaccines can

of 95 % against covid_19 . in adults > 65 years_of_age , it achieved an ef_ﬁcacy > 94 % ( 93 ) . based on their current projections , p ﬁzer and biontech expect to manufacture up to 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021 ( 53 ) . on december 2 , 2020 , the uk mhra awarded a temporaryeua for the p ﬁzer/biontech ’ s bnt162b2 mrna vaccine ( 94 ) . the uk national_health_service ( nhs ) has launched the largest mass vaccination campaign in its history . the uk ’ s vaccination program will initially include highly vulnerable elderly ( 95 ) . the us fda also granted p ﬁzer/biontech ’ s bnt162b2 mrna vaccine eua on december 11 , 2020 . pﬁzer has developed logistical plans for effective vaccine transport , distribution and storage in the usa ( 77 ) . vaccine distribution is based on just_in_time system that will deliver the frozen vials directly to the point of use in a speciallydesigned , temperature_controlled thermal shippers . the rec_ ommended storage temperature ( i.e. , −70°c ± 10°c ) is maintained for up to 10 days in the thermal shippers viautilization of dry_ice . the location and storage temperature of vaccine shipments are tracked by global positioning system ( gps ) _enabled thermal sensors ( 77 ) . pﬁzer has provided three options for the vaccine storage in the point of use : ( i ) storing the frozen vials in ultra_low temperature freezers for up to 6 months , ( ii ) storing the frozen vials temporarily in thethermal shippers for up to 30 days by re ﬁlling the dry_ice every 5 days , or ( iii ) storing the vaccines in cold temperature ( i.e. , 2 –8°c ) for 5 days . thawed vials can not be re_frozen ( 77 ) . although these plans are feasible for vaccine distribu_ tion in the usa , they require an ef ﬁcient , ultra_cold network of grounds and air transport , which may not be available in many other countries that are also affected by covid_19 . moderna ’ s mrna_1273 vaccine on november 16 , 2020 , moderna announced the results of the ﬁrst interim_analysis of its phase 3 clinical_trial . moderna ’ s mrna_1273 vaccine met its primary and second_ ary ef_ﬁcacy endpoints with an ef_ﬁcacy of 94.5 % ( 96 ) . moderna expects the production of 500 million to 1 billiondoses in 2021 globally ( 96 ) . moderna ’ s mrna_1273 vaccine is shipped at standard freezer temperatures of −20°c ± 5°c . after thawing at the point of use , it can be stored at 2 –8°c for 30 days or at 25°c for 12 h ( 75 ) . the enhanced stability pro ﬁle of mrna_1273 vaccine allows simpler and more ﬂexible distribution compared to pﬁzer/biontech ’ s bnt162b2 mrna vaccine , although storage and transport of multi_billion doses of vaccines in −20°c is still prohibitory expensive in many countries . challenges of distributing covid_19 vac__cines in cold_chain the cold_chain should be maintained from the time of vaccine manufacturing through the time of vaccine adminis_tration or just a few hours be fore the administration . maintaining the cold_chain is a shared responsibility of vaccine manufacturers , distributors , public health personnel , and health care providers . an ef ﬁcient cold_chain counts on three main elements , well_trained personnel , reliable storage and temperature monitoring equipment , and accurate vaccine inventory management ( 97 ) .vaccine exposure to an inappropriate condition ( e.g. , accidental overheating or freezing due to the breach of thecold chain ) may result in reduction of potency that could not be regained . for example , a single exposure of any refriger_ ated vaccine or diluent ( e.g. , diluents containing aluminumsalts ) to a freezing temperature ( i.e. , ≤0°c ) can destroy the vaccine ( 85 ) . populations who are unintentionally vaccinated with a vaccine exposed to inappropriate temperatures shouldbe revaccinated , resulting in extra doses for the individual and extra costs for the provider , which is critical when rapid mass vaccination is required . the requirement of the ultracold temperatures for the storage and transport of the most advanced covid_19 mrna vaccines , especially the −70°c freezing condition required by the bnt162b2 , is a major challenge towardsvaccine distribution and thus rapid mass immunization , particularly in climatic zones iva ( i.e. , 30°c/65 % relative_humidity ) and ivb ( i.e. , 30°c/75 % relative_humidity ) ( 98 ) . these vaccines should be stored and transported in controlled environment to maintain their quality and potency . the storage and transport equipment ( e.g. , cold rooms , refriger_ators , freezers , cold boxes , and the thermal shippers designed by pﬁzer ) are costly to acquire and should comply with the who standards . in countries and regions that have outdatedtechnologies with poor temperature control , the vaccines canbe potentially exposed to temperature ﬂuctuations during storage and/or transport , resulting in vaccine wastage . apart from the costs of maintaining the ultracold temperatureadded to the vaccination program , vaccine wastage slows the rate of vaccination during this pandemic . for the frozen mrna vaccines , the time taken for the vaccines ( i.e. , storedat−20°c or −70°c ) to thaw ( i.e. , ~2 h at 2 –8°c , 30 min at room_temperature ( up to 25°c ) ) will add further challenge . it is encouraging that some covid_19 vaccines that have recently received eua in various countries around theworld do not need freezing temperatures for distribution and storage , and many other covid_19 vaccines that are expected to receive eua or ﬁnal approval will likely also have suf ﬁcient shelf lives in 2 –8°c . in many communities around the world , the infrastructure for the 2 –8°c is already in existence , and thus , many covid_19 vaccine candidateswith limited stability at ambient temperatures are expected t or e a c hm a n ye n du s e r s .h o w e v e r , t h ee x i s t i n gc o l dc h a i n will struggle to support both the standard national immuni_zation programs and covid_19 vaccines . consequently , there is a critical need to integrate thermo_stabilizing technologies into future covid_19 vaccines for the worldto rapidly and cost_effectively vaccinate against covid_19.any signi_ﬁcant delay in vaccinating a suf ﬁcient percent of the world populations to build herd_immunity would give sars_cov_2 the chance to mutate to more infectious and/or deadlier variants . existing technologies to eliminate requirement of cold temperature storgeand distribution or at least avoid the need for an ultracold temperatures there has been a strong and persistent interest in making vaccines stable at ambient temperatures , and various prom_ ising technologies have been developed . optimizing the126 page 8 of 15 aaps_pharmscitech ( 2021 ) 22 : 126 composition of vaccines by including certain polymers or sugars can make certain vaccines insensitive to freezing and/or stable for months at room temperatures ( 99 ) . another very practical approach is to transform vaccines from liquid ( or f r o z e nl i q u i do rf r o z e ns u s pension ) to dry powder for reconstitution at the point of administration . several technol_ ogies have been tested to convert liquid vaccines into more stable dry powder form that can be stored in ambienttemperatures for months , if not years . thermal and mechan_ ical stresses encountered during these drying processes can be overcome by using appropria te excipients and process parameters ( 100 ) . conventional shelf freeze_drying is commonly utilized powder engineering technology to transform small_molecule drugs as well as vaccines and other biologics into dry powderswhile maintaining stability and sterility ( 101 ) . excipients ( e.g. , sugars and amino_acids ) have been employed to preserve the activity of biologics during freeze_drying ( 102 ) . continuous freeze_drying has been proposed to enhance the uniformity of heat transfer and reduce the primary drying time ( 103 ) . for instance , spin freeze_drying is a continuous freeze_dryingtechnology in which the vial content is frozen by a cold gas as the vial is spun along its longitudinal axis . this innovative process provides numerous advantages over the conventionalshelf freeze_drying including reduction of primary dryingtime , increasing the surface area for sublimation , and exposing all vials to the same process conditions ( 104 ) . freeze_dried vaccine powders generally exhibit better stability as compared to their liquid counterparts . most marketed freeze_dried vaccines are intended to be reconsti_ tuted before administration by injection ( 13 ) . freeze_drying has also been employed to transform vaccines into stable powders for needle_free noninvasive administration ( e.g. , modi ﬁed vaccinia virus ankara vaccine via the intranasal route ) ( 105 ) . limitations of traditional shelf freeze_drying technology include the phase separation as a result of the low cooling rate employed ( i.e. , 1 –10 k/min ) ( 106 ) . generally , slow cooling/freezing results in the formation of large ice crystals and solute concentrate in the non_ice_phase ( i.e. , 20 –50_fold higher than the initial concentration ) and thus phase separa_tion between two or more excipients or between the protein and other excipients ( 106 ) . phase separation causes irrevers_ ible damage of proteins ( e.g. , denaturation , aggregation ) ( 107,108 ) . slow cooling of a protein solution generates powders with a large percent of particles of 4.8 –120 microns ( i.e. , 95 % ) with low speci_ﬁc surface area , which in turn limits their deliverability via some routes of administration ( e.g. , thepulmonary or intranasal ) ( 109 ) . additionally , shelf freeze_ drying is challenged by the added costs of lyophilization ( 110 ) . spray_drying is another technology for transforming vaccines into dry powders , usually in the presence of excipients ( e.g. , sugars , proteins , amino_acids , polymers , surfactants , and plasticizers ) ( 111,112 ) . it is cost_effective ( i.e. , consumes less energy compared to freeze_drying ) , can be scaled up in sterile environments , does not involvefreezing or high vacuum , and can produce powder with suitable aerodynamic properties for potential pulmonary immunization . spray_drying has been successfully employedto help maintain the viability of bacteria ( e.g. , mycobacterium ) and live_attenuated viruses ( e.g. , measles ) in dry powder for up to four months at 25°c or 37°c ( 100,113 ) . this powder engineering technology has also been successfully utilized to transform an inactivated in ﬂ uenza vaccine into dry powder for intranasal vaccination ( 114 ) . spray_drying is particularly important for preparing inhaled vaccine powders with enhanced long_term stability at room_temperature ( e.g. , inhaled powder of in ﬂuenza subunit vaccine ) ( 112,115–117 ) . it was also employed for the production of recombinant non_replicating human type_5 ad and vesicular_stomatitis_virus ( vsv ) _coloaded coated pow_ders for oral administration ( 68 ) . limitations of spray_drying include antigen exposure to high stresses during the atomiza_ tion and drying steps and the possibility of antigen denatur_ ation due to the formation of air_water interfaces during theatomization step and the heat stress applied to facilitate the evaporation of the solvent , into which the antigens and excipients are dissolved or dispersed ( 111 ) . spray freeze_drying is a relatively recent drying technol_ ogy that combines freeze_drying and spray_drying technolo_ gies . it includes three main steps : the atomization of bulkliquid into droplets , freezing of droplets in the presence of a cryogen ( e.g. , liquid nitrogen ) , and removal of ice via sublimation at very low pressure and temperature ( 118 ) . it is advantageous in terms of providing high powder yield , ﬁne control of particle characteristics , and reducing heat stress to biologics ( 119 ) . an in ﬂuenza subunit vaccine was formulated into a dry powder comprising trehalose , mannitol , anddextran by spray freeze_drying . the vaccine powder exhibited physical and biochemical stability for up to 1 year of storage at room_temperature ( 119 ) . spray freeze_drying has also been utilized to formulate in ﬂuenza vaccines as stable dry powders for intranasal or pulmonary vaccination to elicit both systemic and mucosal immune responses ( 112,120–122 ) . it is also applicable for the transformation of vaccines containingaluminum salts into dry powder without showing signs of signiﬁcant coagulation upon reconstitution ( 123 ) . recently , qiu et al . developed mrna_inhaled powder using spray_ drying and spray freeze_dying technologies ; however , the stability pro ﬁle was not reported ( 124 ) . limitations of spray freeze_drying include ( i ) high costs ( i.e. , 30 –50_fold higher than spray_drying ) , ( ii ) the majority of developed spray freeze_drying units are not suitable for full commercialization , ( iii ) unwanted ﬁne powder elutriation , and ( iv ) high interfacial tension of the atomized droplets ( 118 ) . the adsorption of proteins at the air_liquid interface during atomization is a major source of protein aggregationand loss of biological_activity ( 125 ) . the freezing step could also result in ice crystallization and phase separation ( 126 ) . other technologies include foam_drying that has been employed to convert a live attenuated h1n1 in ﬂuenza vaccine to a dry powder that was stable for > 1.5 years at room_temperature ( 127 ) . thin_ ﬁlm freeze_drying ( tffd ) i sar e l a t i v e l yn e w powder engineering technology that has showed promise in the formulation of thermostable vaccine dry powders . thin_ ﬁlm freezing ( tff ) is an ultra_rapid freezing process in which a liquid formulation ( i.e. , aqueous phase or organic phase solution/suspension with/without excipients ) of the active pharmaceutical ingredient ( e.g. , small molecules , macromole_cules , or viruses ) is dropped ( e.g. , droplet diameter around 2 –page 9 of 15 126 aaps_pharmscitech ( 2021 ) 22 : 126 4 mm ) onto a cryogenically cooled surface , forming thin ﬁlms upon impact , which then rapidly freeze , and the frozen ﬁlms are subsequently placed in a lyophilizer to allow the sublimation of the solvent ( 128–130 ) . tffd can produce highly porous , low_density brittle matrix powders with goodaerosol properties for lung deposition by inhalation ( 131– 136 ) . importantly , the stability and activity of the biologics are maintained after subject to tffd ( 129 ) . the freezing rate during tff is signi_ﬁcantly higher than during conventional shelf freeze_drying , but lower than during spray freeze_drying ; however , tff reduces the gas_liquid interface by up to twoorders of magnitude as compared to spray freeze_drying ( 109 ) . during tff , there is an added liquid_solid interface between the thin ﬁlms before they are frozen and a cryogen_ ically cooled solid surface . previously , the tffd technology has been utilized to successfully convert some commercially available insoluble aluminum salt_adjuvanted liquid v accines ( i.e. , veterinary tetanus toxoid vaccine , human hepatiti s b vaccine , and human papilloma virus vaccine ) into dry powders wh ile maintaining their immuno_ genicity and particle size distr ibution after reconstitution ( 92 ) . the preserved particle size distribution and immunogenicity of aluminum salt_adjuvanted vacci nes after tffd may be attributed t ot h er a p i dc o o l i n gr a t e ( i . e . ,1 0 0 –1000 k/s ) that prevents particle aggregation via accelerating the n ucleation rate and the formation of small ice crystals ( 109,119,137 ) . the immunogenicity of thin_ ﬁlm freeze_dried , alhydrogel ® ( i.e. , aluminum hydroxide ) _ adjuvanted ovalbumin model vaccine did not signi_ﬁcantly change after the model vaccine in dry powder was exposed to repeated freeze_thawing or to temperatures as high as 40°c for 3 months ( 138 ) . the potential of using the thin_ ﬁlm freeze_dried vaccine powder for mucosal vacci nation has also been explored . intranasal vaccination using alhydrogel®_adjuvanted ovalbumin dry powder ( as a model vac_cine ) elicited speci_ﬁc antibodies in rat serum samples and mucosal secret ions ( i.e. , iga in the nasal and lung mucosal secretions ) ( 139 ) . finally , data from our recent studies showed that mrna_encap sulated lipid nanoparticles can also be successfully converted t o dry powders with good aerosol properties , while preserving the particle size using tffd ( unpublished data ) . th ese promising precli nical data together with the ease of using tffd to produce powders in their ﬁnal packaging containers suggest t ffd as a promising technology for the production of thermostable vaccine powders that do not need to be stored in a cold temperature . tffd is currently used tocgmp manufacture materials for phase 1/2 clinical_trials ( unpub_ lished data ) ; however , the requi rement of large quantities of cryogens to produce and maintain a cryogenically cooled surface as well as the added costs of lyoph ilization are limitations ( 129 ) . finally , due to the ideal aerosol performance properties of the powders prepared by tffd , the resultant dry powder vaccines are expected to be deliverable through a non_invasiveroute such as intranasal or pulmonary administration ( 129,140 ) . in fact , intranasal delns1_2019_ncov_rbd_opt1 , a covid_19 vaccine candidate based on in ﬂuenza virus carrying sars_cov_2 rbd , has entered phase 1 clinical_trial recently ( i.e. , chictr2000037782 ) ( 141 ) . altimmune ’ s ad vector_based adcovid vaccine candidate intend ed for intranasal vaccination is expected to enter phase 1 clinical_trial soon ( 142 ) . finally , codagenix and the serum institute of india have begun a ﬁrst_in_ human clinical_trial of their single_dose intranasal covi_vaccovid_19 vaccine ( 143 ) . therefore , it is not unreasonable toexpect a future approved of int ranasal covid_19 vaccine . technologies such as tffd and spray_drying can be used toconvert the vaccines into stable inhaled dry powders for more efﬁcient distribution and vaccination . conclusions and perspectives the most advanced covid_19 vaccine candidates that are currently in phase 3 or phase 2/3 clinical_trials or have been granted eua are all expected to be stored and transported at cold or ultracold temperatures ( i.e. , 2 –8°c , or −20°c or −70°c ) . thus , even if all of them are successfully commercialized , rapid mas s immunization of the world_population is expected to be challenged by the costs and logistics needed to maintain the vaccines in the ( ultra ) coldtemperatures during transport , storage , and distribution , particularly in less developed communities . moreover , exist_ ing cold_chain will struggle to support both the standardnational immunization programs and covid_19 vaccines ( 98 ) . for some of the vaccines , accidental breach of the cold_chain may result in immunization failure or vaccine wastage . mathematical simulation of vaccination revealed that factors associated with execution are more important in the effectiveness of global vaccination programs than the vac_cines ’ immunogenicity established in the clinical studies ( 144 ) . thus , the ef ﬁciency of vaccine manufacturing and distribution along with other factors such as pandemic severity and public preparation should be considered during the development ofeffective vaccine candidates . “ even a vaccine that is only 50 % effective in preventing disease could quell the pandemic if it were distributed quickly enough , ” said jason l. schwartz of yale school of public health ( 145 ) . according to the fda guidance document for industry , a minimum primary ef_ﬁcacy threshold of 50 % will ensure the effectiveness of covid_19vaccine candidate ( 146 ) . thus , the ef ﬁciency of vaccine distribution must be consid ered while developing next generation covid_19 vaccines . importantly , there are exist_ ing technologies that can be applied to transform most , if notall , the vaccines into dry powders to overcome the strict cold or ultracold temperature requirement to ultimately improve the ef ﬁciency of vaccine distribution . vaccine developers must be incentivized to prioritize vaccine stability outside the cold_chain . it is understandable that during the early phase of the race for safe and effective sars_cov_2 vaccines , logistics fordistribution and storage stability were not be a priority to vaccine developers . in the next phase of vaccine develop_ ment , more thermostable second_generation vaccines must bedeveloped . acknowledgements k.a . would like to express his

vomiting have also been reported ( mayo clinic , 2021 ) . the purpose of this manuscript is to explore the relationship between patients with known allergie s to reported adverse_reactions with coronavirus vaccines . in particular we examine the most common food , drug and environmental allergies co_occurring with coronavirus vaccine adverse_reactions to determine if any relationship exists . we then investigate specific patient demographic information such as age and gender to determine any statistical connection to coronavirus vaccine adverse_reactions . the rest of this manuscript is organized as follows . section 2 contains the literature review that focuses on allergies , covid__19 vaccines , the vaccine adverse reporting system ( vaers ) and known covid__19 vaccine allergies . section 3 is our research questions . section 4 is the system design including vaers data , etl and data cleaning . section 5 is the experimenta l design . section 6 provides the experimental results and discussion . finally , section 7 delivers the conclusions , limitations and future directions . covid___19 _ vaccine allergi c reactions schumaker _ veronin _ rohm _ dixit___aljawarneh _ lara

for reporting vaccine adverse e ffects and known allergies to covid _19vaccines . we then present the research gaps that have motivated this investigation . allergies the term allergy is used to refer to an organism ’ s im mune response to a certain substance that is generally harmless for other individuals , that can cause a series of symptoms in said organism . an allergy tends to manifest itself as a temporary allergic_reaction that is visible as a series of highly varied s ymptoms which manifest as skin problems , ( eczema , erythema , pruritus , etc . ) bronchial problems ( bronchospasm ) , problems of the nasal mucus , eyes ( conjunctivitis ) , the digestive tract ( diarrhea or vomiting ) and even other organs of the body . it may also lea d to allergic diseases such as asthma , rhinitis or urticaria , to mention a few . in the most severe cases , it may produce anaphylactic shock , a severe and generalised allergic_reaction that may even cause the patient ’ s death ( brown & turner , 2015 ) . there are di fferent mechanisms for the diagnosis of allergies , ranging from skin tests , blood tests or genetic studies . with regard to treatment , current medical practice is based on four fundamental pillars , which are patient education , allergen avoidance , pharmacological intervention , and immunotherapy ( levin , 2018 ) . allergies may be classified in multiple ways , although this work focuses more on the type of substance that causes the allergy . in this connection , it is worth highlighting three types of allergies : those caused by foods such as eggs or milk ; those caused by medicines such as antibiotics or anaesthetics ; or those caused by environmental agents such as dust mites or pollen . in general , the di fferent studies conducted point to a slow increase in the p revalence of allergies among the world ’ s population , mainly those caused by food and especially in western nations ( tang & mullins , 2017 ) . covid__19 vaccines a vaccine is a drug product that stimulates the immune system o ffering protection from an infecti ous disease and vaccination is the act of introducing a vaccine into the body . an individual who is immune to a disease because they have been vaccinated can not get that disease and can not spread it to others . in other words , if covid___19 _ vaccine allergi c reactions schumaker _ veronin _ rohm _ dixit___aljawarneh _ lara ©international information m anagement_association , inc. 2021 27 . an individual is immune to a disease , they can be exposed to it without becoming infected . covid__19 is known to be caused by a virus known as sars _cov _2 coronavirus ( veronin et al . , 2021 ) . prior to the development of vaccines to prevent covid__19 , the most e ffective way to prevent il lness was to avoid exposure to the virus . to date , three covid__19 vaccines are authorized by the u.s. food and drug administration ( fda ) for emergency use : pfizer/biontech , moderna , and janssen ( produced by johnson and johnson ) . additional vaccines may rec eive authorization in 2021 . an emergency_use_authorization ( eua ) allows the fda to make medical products available immediately . the eua process di ffers from an established fda approval or clearance . under an eua the fda makes a medical product , such as a v accine , available to the public based on the best available evidence , forgoing all of the evidence necessary for o fficial fda approval or clearance . when evaluating an eua , medical experts carefully balance the potential risks and benefits of the products based on the available data . on december 11 , 2020 the fda issued an eua for the pfizer _biontech covid___19 vaccine for individuals 16 years_of_age and older . on may 10 , 2021 the fda expanded the eua to include adolescents 12 _15 years_of_age . the pfizer _biontech covid__19 vaccine is a messenger_rna ( mrna ) type , which uses a relatively new innovative formulation technology . unlike attenuated vaccines that introduce a weakened or inactivated virus into the body , the pfizer _ biontech mrna vaccine delive rs a tiny piece of genetic code from the sars cov _2 virus to host_cells in the body , essentially giving those cells instructions , or blueprints , for making copies of the protein spikes protruding from the coronavirus . these proteins stimulate an immune res ponse by producing antibodies and developing memory cells that provide protection if the body is infected with the actual virus . on december 18 , 2020 a second vaccine for prevention of covid__19 , manufactured by modernatx , inc , was authorized for emergency use by individuals 18 years_of_age and older . moderna is also an mrna vaccine using the same technology as pfizer _biontech . on february 27 , 2021 the fda issued an eua for a third vaccine manufactured by janssen biotech inc , a subsidiary of johnson and john son , for individuals 18 years_of_age and older . the janssen covid__19 vaccine is known as a carrier vaccine , or viral vector vaccine which uses a di fferent approach than mrna vaccines . viral vector vaccines use a modified version of a di fferent virus , such as an adenovirus ( the vector ) to instruct human cells to make the sars cov _2 virus spike_protein , stimulating an immune response that provides protection if the body is infected with the actual virus . covid___19 _ vaccine allergi c reactions schumaker _ veronin _ rohm _ dixit___aljawarneh _ lara ©international information m anagement_association , inc. 2021 28 . in early april 2021 the cdc and fda issued a joint recommendation for states to pause the use of the janssen covid__19 vaccine due to a rare , potentially serious , blood clotting disorder among women ages 18 to 48 , occurring 6 _13 days after vaccination . on april 23 , 2021 , the fda ended its recommended pause on the vaccine and added a warning label about the blood clotting disorder which cleared the way to resume vaccinations . on july 12 , 2021 the fda announced a warning of increased risk for guillainbarré syndrome , a progressively damaging neurological disor der that can lead to paralysis or death for males 50 years_of_age or older that can occur within 14 days of vaccination ( rendall , 2021 ) . given these specific age/gender combinations reacting adversely to coronavirus vaccines , having accurate records of vac_cine adverse_reactions can help medical professionals make informed vaccine _related decisions . vaers the vaccine adverse_event reporting system ( vaers ) is one of the largest government databases and is comprised of adverse_event reports following vaccina tion ( singleton et al. , 1999 ) . established in 1990 , vaers functions as a warning system to detect potential safety issues associated with vaccines . anyone can submit a report to vaers and reports have come from a variety of sources : healthcare professional s , health departments , vaccine manufacturers , and vaccine recipients ( patients and family members ) if they experience any adverse_events after receiving a vaccine . vaers is co _administered by two agencies within the u.s. department of health and human serv ices ( hhs ) ; the centers_for_disease_control and prevention ( cdc ) and the u.s. food and drug administration ( fda ) . the cdc and the fda analyze reports of adverse_events that monitor health problems that may occur following vaccination ( varricchio et al. , 2004 ) . while reports to vaers are voluntary , healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to report any additional clinically significant adverse_events following vaccination , even if they are not sure if vaccination caused the event . however , under certain conditions , healthcare providers are required by law to report to vaers after vaccination . conditions include : 1 ) vaccine administration errors , whether or not associated with an adverse_event ( ae ) , 2 ) serious aes as defined by the fda regardless of caus ality , which includes : death , life_threatening , inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization , or any pre _specified event that occurs within a certain period after vaccination . according to the cdc , the number of vaers reports submi tted varies each year . during 2011 _2014 , vaers averaged around 30,000 reports annually , with 7 % covid___19 _ vaccine allergi c reactions schumaker _ veronin _ rohm _ dixit___aljawarneh _ lara ©international information m anagement_association , inc. 2021 29 . classified as serious ( shimabukuro et al. , 2015 ) . in 2019 vaers received over 48,000 reports . about 85 _90 % of the reports described mild side e ffects such as fever , arm soreness , or mild irritability . the remaining reports are classified as serious , which means that the reported ae resulted in permanent disability , hospitalization , prolongation of an existing hospitalization , life _threatening illness , congenital deformity/birth_defect or death . according to the cdc these events can happen after vaccination , but are rarely caused by the vaccine . known covid__19 vaccine allergies in addition to adverse e ffects in general , allergic_reactions have been documented and may be categorized as non _severe or severe . non _severe allergic_reactions include by pale or reddened irregular , elevated patches and severe itching ( urticaria or hives ) , swelling or wheezing within 4 hours of the vaccine . severe allergic_reactions to the vaccine are rare and may occur within 15 minutes of getting vaccinated . most have occurred in people with a history of allergies and who had previously experienced a severe and potentially life _threatening allergic_reaction known as anaphyla xis . signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis include a sensation of tightness in the throat which may cause the throat to close , or trouble breathing . other rare occurrences reported after covid__19 vaccination include blood clots in younger women ( thrombosis wit h thrombocytopenia syndrome ( tts ) ) after janssen injections . in addition , researchers are investigating the link between cases of inflammation of the heart , known as myocarditis and pericarditis in adolescents and young adults , occurring after mrna vaccina tion . a vaccine component known as polyethylene glycol ( peg ) has been associated with anaphylaxis . currently , peg is found in the mrna vaccines from pfizer and moderna . the janssen vaccine does not contain peg , however , it contains polysorbate , which is kn own to cross _react with peg . this means that if an individual is sensitive to peg , they may also be sensitive to polysorbate . given the hundreds of millions of vaccine doses administered , reports of aes following vaccination , including deaths , are considered rare and do not necessarily mean that the vaccine directly caused the problem . since covid19 vaccines are relatively new , scientists and clinicians have more questions than answers about the occurrence of allergic_reactions . research is ongoing to determine which patients , particularly those with prior vaccine allergies , may be at greater risk of adverse_reactions to covid__19 vaccines . covid___19 _ vaccine allergi c reactions schumaker _ veronin _ rohm _ dixit___aljawarneh _ lara ©international information m anagement_association , inc. 2021 30 . research gaps from this review , there are no studies that specifically examine patient allergies and their re lationship to coronavirus vaccine adverse e ffects . most studies have focused on specific disease states resulting from a vaccine . using historical patient data , medical professionals can improve vaccine recommendations based on specific patient factors . research questions which covid__19 vaccine is associated with the fewest reported adverse_reactions ? adverse_reactions can occur with just about any vaccine . analyzing the impacts of covid__19 vaccines can help the public make informed decisions . which allergens are most associated with patient deaths for the covid__19 vaccines ? for patients with certain a llergies , which allergens are observed most often and which vaccines are associated with these adverse e ffects . answering this question can help guide patients to selecting vaccines least likely to cause significant adverse e ffects . are there patient demo graphic differences w.r.t . to the covid__19 vaccines and allergic_reactions ? how does age and gender a ffect vaccine adverse e ffects ? we analyze the three vaccines according to patient age and gender for life _threatening reactions . answering this question c an help providers to best recommend a vaccine to patients . covid___19 _ vaccine allergi c reactions schumaker _ veronin _ rohm _ dixit___aljawarneh _ lara ©international information m anagement_association , inc. 2021 31 . system design to answer these research questions we created the tylerade system as shown in figure 1 . figure 1 _ the tylerade system this system collects vaers data : patient , symptom and vaccine data , before cleaning it by removing excess whitespace and performing a spellcheck . the most common food , drug and environmental allergies are then collected and used to filter vaers data and store it in a database . the database is then queried to look for statistical relationships in the data . experimental design for our study we used the vaccine adverse_event reporting system ( vaers ) 4 data from january 1 to march 30 , 2021 . vaers data is stored in three tables of data , symptoms and vaccine . for our study there were 46,163 records for data , 64,356 for symptoms and 46,824 for vaccine . between the three tables there were 45,800 covid__19 vac_cine records in common . table 1 shows the breakdown of vaers records for each of the three covid__19 vaccines and the number of records in which allergens were reported . 4 https : //vaers.hhs.gov/index.html covid___19 _ vaccine

13,683 pfizer 20,180 9,422 janssen 5,324 4,227 table 1 : covid__19 vaers records by vaccine for allergens we selected the most common food , drug and environmental allergens ( healthline , 2020 ; the daily meal , 2012 ; webmd , 2021 ) . for food allergens we used egg , milk , peanut , soy , wheat , tree nuts , shellfish , fish , raw fruits/vegetables and sesame ( the daily meal , 2012 ) . for drug allergies we used * cillin ( family of antibiotics , e.g . ; penicillin , amoxicillin , etc . ) , tetracycline , ibuprofen , naproxen , aspirin , sulfa_drugs , chemotherapy drugs , cetuximab , rituximab , abacavir , nevirapine , insulin , carbamazepine , lamotrigine , phenytoin , atracurium , succinylcholine and vecuronium ( webmd , 2021 ) . for environmental allergies we used dustmi tes , pollen , pet dander , mold and smoke ( healthline , 2020 ) . results and discussion to answer our research questions , we investigated the vaers data for each of the three covid__19 vaccines . which covid__19 vaccine is associated with the fewest reported adverse_reactions ? to answer this research question we analyze the proportion of vaers records in which allergens were reported versus their totals for each of the three vaccines as shown in table 2 . from this data , janssen had the highest propor tion of adverse_event reports where an allergy co _occurred with 79.40 % , followed by moderna with 67.42 % and pfizer with 46.69 % . covid___19 _ vaccine allergi c reactions schumaker _ veronin _ rohm _ dixit___aljawarneh _ lara ©international information m anagement_association , inc. 2021 33 . vaccine records allergen pct hospitalized pct death pct moderna 20,296 67.42 % 2.38 % 5.15 % pfizer 20,180 46.69 % 2.59 % 2.70 % janssen 5,324 79.40 % 0.62 % 0.60 % table 2 : covid__19 vaccine record counts and reaction severity however , the presence of adverse reports does not address the reaction severity such as mild versus life _threatening interactions . looking at the life _threatening reactions , 2.38 % of adverse_reactions for moderna required hospitalization and 5.15 % died whereas for janssen 0.62 % required hospitalization and 0.60 % died . janssen had a larger percentage of adverse_reaction reports , but ma ny of the reactions were not life _threatening . there are a few unique circumstances that make these vaccines di fferent and can impact the distribution of adverse_reactions . first and foremost is that all vaccines are dosed in multidose vials . therefore thi s forces a batch system type distribution , limiting vaccinations to small groups of 5 or 10 individuals depending on the multi _ dose vial . as such , vaccine distribution for such a limited resource make distribution a group e ffort , and not an individual proc ess . it is unclear how this may , or may not , a ffect the reported adverse_events . another confounding factor is the temperature at which the vaccine needs to be stored . as the pandemic was unfolding , the pfizer vaccine needed to be stored at a temperature o f _112 to _67 degree f. this limited the distribution of the pfizer vaccine to facilities that had the proper equipment . some vaccine locations could not properly store the vaccine , therefore introducing a selection_bias into the process , as many small and /or rural facilities elected not to distribute the pfizer vaccine . it is unclear how this a ffected the reported adverse_events . with the process of vaccination , or 2 vaccines for certain individuals , there is also a concern that those individuals receiving only 1 of the 2 injections may not have had su fficient vaccine to provide proper immunization . to answer research question 1 of which vaccine is associated with the fewest number of reported adverse_reactions , the pfizer vaccine had the fewest with 46.69 % , however , janssen had the fewest life _threatening reactions . covid___19 _ vaccine allergi c reactions schumaker _ veronin _ rohm _ dixit___aljawarneh _ lara ©international information m anagement_association , inc. 2021 34 . which allergens are most associated with patient deaths for the covid__19 vaccines ? to answer this research question we investigated common food , drug and environmental allergens and their co _occurrence with the three vaccines . table 3 lists the percentage of vaers records in which a specific allergen was reported . for presentation clarity we excluded allergens where none of the vaccines exceeded 1.00 % of adverse reports . vaccine egg tree nut shellfish * cillin aspirin sulfa pollen moderna 0.81 % 0.93 % 2.00 % 11.49 % 0.99 % 9.66 % 0.98 % pfizer 0.74 % 1.09 % 2.06 % 11.13 % 1.21 % 9.70 % 0.99 % janssen 1.02 % 1.25 % 1.77 % 11.92 % 0.95 % 7.22 % 1.54 % table 3 : lists the percentage of vaers records with specific allergen reported from this data both the * cillin and sulfa family of drugs had the highest proportion of reported adverse_reactions across all three vaccines . it was interesting to note the similarity o f proportion across all three vaccines . these numbers indicate that for 11 % and 9 % of adverse_reactions , * cillin and sulfa_drugs were present respectively . while we do not possess data for allergy patients that did not have an adverse_reaction , the relativ e difference in reaction percentages is still a cause for concern for those patients with * cillin and sulfa allergies . if we were to look at the occurrence of patient adverse records containing both * cillin and sulfa_drugs , this combination accounted for 1 .98 % of moderna reactions , 1.95 % for pfizer and 1.75 % for janssen ; much smaller by comparison . analyzing allergens through the prism of patient death for food , drug and environment are tables 4 , 5 and 6 respectively . for presentation clarity we omitted any allergen that did not have 30 or more occurrences per vaccine . from this data for adverse_reaction to * cillin drugs , 6.10 % of pfizer patients died versus 1.39 % for janssen . sulfa_drugs showed a similar ordering with 4.70 % of pfizer patients dying versus 0 .66 % for janssen . the other notable findings were for the antibiotic tetracycline which shown a similar ordering with 6.56 % of pfizer patients dying and aspirin where 8.89 % of moderna and 5.26 % of pfizer patients died . it does appear that janssen is the sa fest of the three vaccines in contributing to the fewest patient deaths across all allergens investigated . these results stand in contrast to prior work in which there has been no generally accepted research published of a link between drug allergies and v accines adverse covid___19 _ vaccine allergi c reactions schumaker _ veronin _ rohm _ dixit___aljawarneh _ lara ©international information m anagement_association , inc. 2021 35 .

differences w.r.t . to the covid__19 vaccines and allergic_reactions ? to answer this research question we analyze the three vaccines according to patient age and gender for life _threatening reactions as shown in table 7 . from this data the average age of patient adverse_reactions for both moderna and pfizer was 51.0 years versus 46.1 years for janssen . the average age for adverse_reactions is a bit misleading . during the period of study , covid__19 vaccines were eligible for patients 75 years or older , or had a compromised immune system , or covid___19 _ vaccine allergi c reactions schumaker _ veronin _ rohm _ dixit___aljawarneh _ lara ©international information m anagement_association , inc. 2021 36 . had a substantial risk factor or were frontline healthcare workers . because of the skewness of data we can not make patient age generalizations in the absolute sense . instead we can use the age _related data comparatively . this is to say patients of 51.0 years are not in more danger , rather that janssen appears to affect younger patients more than other vaccines . also within the data females had 2.9x more reported adverse_reactions than ma les . this is a similarly unexpected result and could also be the result of skewed data where more female healthcare workers were receiving the vaccine than male counterparts . we do not have access to such data to know this definitively so we will also use gender for comparative analysis . if we were to focus on just * cillin and sulfa_drugs and their patient demographics for adverse_reactions , we would arrive at tables 8 and 9 respectively . vaccine avg age male female hospitalized died moderna 51.0 5,025 14,908 1,556 1,140 pfizer 51.0 4,966 14,567 1,499 989 janssen 46.1

covid__19 vaccine patient demographics for sulfa_drugs from this data patient age is roughly similar to that in table 7 . however vaccine adverse e ffects appear to be a ffecting females in greater numbers , 4.5x for * cillin and 9.2x for sulfa_drugs versus 2.9x for all allergen s. this significant increase in adverse e ffects for females is certainly interesting and should be studied further . patients with life _threatening reactions appear in a lower proportion . covid___19 _ vaccine allergi c reactions schumaker _ veronin _ rohm _ dixit___aljawarneh _ lara ©international information m anagement_association , inc. 2021 37 . looking deeper at age _related data , tables 10 and 11 show the average patient ages for adverse_reactions for * cillin and sulfa_drugs respectively . vaccine male female hospitalized died moderna 58.5 50.5 61.0 80.2 pfizer 57.7 50.7 55.1 73.7 janssen 48.3 50.4 72.5 73.3 table 10 : covid__19 vaccine patient demographics average age for * cillin drugs

from this data it would appear that females have adverse_reactions at a younger age for moderna and pfizer vaccines . however , for life _threatening reactions such as hospitalization and death , ages track higher with the exception of pfizer hospitalization for * c illin , average age 55.1 years , and janssen hospitalization for sulfa , average age 46.5 years . to investigate these outliers further , we dived deeper into patient ages for life _ threatening reactions to * cillin and sulfa_drugs in tables 12 and 13 respectivel y . from this data we find that average ages for patient death are generally higher than for patient hospitalizations , with the most notable exception for males and sulfa_drugs where the average patient age with death as an outcome , occurs at younger ages f or the moderna and pfizer vaccines . interestingly no male patient death or hospitalization occurred with the janssen vaccine for sulfa drug allergies . further , we noted large average age di fferences across genders for sulfa drug hospitalizations for modern a and pfizer as well as * cillin drug hospitalizations for moderna . covid___19 _ vaccine allergi c reactions schumaker _ veronin _ rohm _

na 46.5 na 71.5 table 13 : covid__19 vaccine patient ages for life _threatening reactions with sulfa_drugs conclusions , limitations and future directions using this data from a patient_safety perspective , it would appear that janssen has the lowest proportion of life _threatening adverse_reactions . in terms of specific allergies , patients with * cillin or sulfa allergies had the most adverse_reactions to covid__19 vaccines , however , janssen again had the lowest number of reported deaths . in terms of patient age and gender , females has 2.9x the number of adverse_reactions than males and a lower average age for reac tions for the pfizer and moderna vaccines . while this study relied on reported adverse_events and not the universe of data ( i.e . patients receiving a vaccine without complication or all patients with an adverse_reaction reporting it ) , the reported data has certainly led to some interesting conclusions . we feel this data could be used by individuals and medical professionals to assist in choosing a vaccine to maximize patient_safety based on their allergy history , age and gender . this article presents an ini tial work that seeks to shed light on the appearance of adverse_reactions caused by di fferent covid__19 vaccines , analyzing co _occurrences between allergens and adverse_reactions caused by these vaccines . for the next step , it would

han et al . 2021 ) . the name sars_cov_2 was provided by the inter _ national committee on taxonomy of viruses ( wang et al . 2020 ) . the disease was named covid_19 by the world_health_organization ( who ) in consultation with the world organization for animal health and united_nations food and agriculture organization ( who 2021a ) . according to the who , there are 131.5 million cases in total and approxi_ mately 2.8 million deaths reported on april 5 , 2021 , due to the deadly virus . this fatal disease has put the global com_ munity on the verge of collapse ( sharma et al . 2021 ; sharma et al . 2021 ) . however , due to the continual efforts from vac__cine manufacturers , research and development centers , and other scientific fraternity , there has been a timely develop_ ment of vaccines and effective supply_chains for delivering the same ( he et al . 2021 ; who 2020a ) . packaging and shipping allow the modern world to func_ tion at ever_increasing levels of complexity ( gaikwad et al . 2018 ; singh et al . 2018 ) . allowing your products to be effec_ tively and efficiently packaged and shipped to you saves you the hassle of having to do it yourself ( gaikwad et al . 2019 ) . a previous study ( haynes et al . 2020 ) mentions , “ there will be no covid_19 vaccine without right packaging. ” a vaccine can be made , however , without proper packaging and storage throughout the entire supply_chain , vaccination will be ineffective . there was ambiguity at the beginning of the vaccine production about its storage , material , and temperature at which it can be transported . the emergence of cutting_edge technologies and state_of_the_art facilities in india and across the globe has facilitated the vaccine_making processes . approximately , 200 vaccine candidates are cur _ rently being developed , and a few of them require ultra_low temperatures ( ult ) and a controlled temperature chain , whereas some others require a standard cold supply_chain ( who 2021b ) . figure 1 illustrates typical packaging and distribution system for the covid_19 vaccine consists of different packaging levels maintaining cold_storage through_ out the supply_chain for a successful vaccination program . the united_states food and drug administration has issued guidelines for vaccine manufacturers regarding stor _ age and temperature monitoring . the end consumer should be aware of the history of the product storage conditions . the use of digital temperature sensors such as thermocouples , resistance temperature detectors , or thermistors can provide accurate data , and purpose_built units or pharmaceutical grade units can be used instead of household or dormitory_ style refrigerators or freezers ( shastri 2013 ) . waste handling post_vaccination is the biggest challenge ( sun et al. , 2021 ) . as the vaccine campaign has already started , and billions of doses are being administered , there are concerns over the disposal of primary_packaging ( vials and syringes ) , sec_ ondary packaging ( cartons ) , tertiary packaging ( corrugating fig . 1 packaging and distribution of the coronavirus disease vaccine consisting of different packaging levels that maintain cold_storage through_ out the supply_chain for a successful vaccination program 3599 environmental_chemistry letters ( 2021 ) 19:3597–3608 1 3 boards ) , and cushioning material and injectable items . in addition to the vaccine packaging material , the disposal of personal_protective_equipment kits is also of prime concern . a proper set of guidelines for waste_disposal has not been established yet ( ndtv 2021 ) . in this comprehensive review , we summarize the role of advance packaging system for the distribution and storage of covid_19 vaccines without deterioration . to the best of our knowledge , there are no review papers on the covid_19 vaccine packaging system . first , we discuss primary packag_ ing materials , such as glass vials and syringes , along with stoppers and seals . we then discuss packaging for distribu_ tion , which includes secondary and tertiary packaging for vaccines . later , we provide an overview of different labeling types used for primary , secondary , and tertiary packaging , barcodes , and packaging inserts . primary_packaging system for covid‑19 vaccines glass vials borosilicate glass vials are the most used material for pack _ aging vaccines because of their inertness . more than 50 bil_ lion glass vials are produced and sold globally for various purposes . glass vials are commonly used in a wide variety of vaccines and treatments ( sumant 2021 ) . schott , a global conglomerate , is one of the largest manufacturers of pharmaceutical packaging units with 20 approved glass and converting plants globally . three out of four vaccine pro_ jects undergoing clinical_trials used schott vials for their vaccine campaigns . in total , it produces approximately 11 billion glass vials per annum , and the estimated target sup_ ply for the covid_19 vaccine campaign is approximately 2 billion doses by the end of 2021 ( schott 2021 ) . the global pharmaceutical glass vial manufacturers ’ community includes major market players such as schott , corning , stevanto group , gerresheimer , and dwk life sciences , which have increased their capacity and quality due to the ongoing demand . although there is a need for improved packaging over simple glass vials due to different storage conditions required for covid_19 vaccines , and consid_ ering the ongoing pandemic , some vaccine manufacturers are likely to adopt the existing packaging format . however , other vaccine manufacturers such as pfizer_biontech and modernatx , where ultra_low temperatures are required , need to opt for different materials ( who 2021b ; imd 2020 ) . a typical glass vial , along with the closures , is shown in fig . 2 . the need to shift the focus to develop new materials for vials might be due to leaching of glass material to the drug , to reduce breakage during manufacturing , faster time to mar _ ket , to decrease load during transportation , thus reducing the carbon footprint and sustaining extreme storage tem_ peratures such as − 60 to − 90 °c ( pfizer_biontech ) ( hogue 2020 ) . researchers at corning have developed coated alu_ minosilicate valor glass vials that have added advantages over borosilicate glass . the ion exchange process is used to produce valor glass vials , which helps in reducing break _ age , particulate contamination , and cracks . in contrast , the coating helps in lowering the coefficient of friction and cos_ metic flaws . corning ’ s registered product valor® meets the united_states pharmacopeia type i hydrolytic criteria with low extractable concentrations and can run the fill lines at higher operational efficiency , i.e. , greater than 80 % com _ pared to conventional glass vials ( shanley 2020 ) . the us_based pharmaceutical industry , sio2 materials_science , has a unique solution for ult applications . they have developed a novel hybrid material , cyclic olefin poly _ mer with nanolayer glass as the inner layer by using plasma_ enhanced chemical_vapor_deposition ( hogue 2020 ; weikart and langer 2020 ) . the structure and layer_wise assembly of the hybrid material vial are shown in fig . 3 . typical stand_ ards for shape , size , dimensions , and performance require_ ments for injection vials made of glass tubing , closures , and aluminum caps are set by international_organization_for_standardization ( iso ) 8362–4:2011 ( iso 2011 ) . some of the standard dimensions acquired by the pharmaceutical industries for type i molded glass vials are listed in table 1 . briefly , the global glass vial industry is facing invincible upsurge in demand even after producing 50 billion vials annually . syringes along with vials , syringes are also crucial in the vacci_ nation process from a packaging perspective . previously , conventional disposable syringes were used to inject stoppe r flange glass vialaluminum ca p rubbe r stoppe r fig . 2 glass vial and closure system for primary_packaging of coro_ navirus disease vaccines consisting of a rubber stopper , aluminum cap , and stopper flange 3600 environmental_chemistry letters ( 2021 ) 19:3597–3608 1 3 drugs ; however , the lack of technological advancement , production capacity , economic necessity , and cultural resistance to waste subsequently aided to reuse the same . to avoid reusability , the who believed that there should be a physical barrier to the reuse of syringes and requested the design of auto disable syringes in 1986 . the purpose of the auto disable syringe is to prevent the transmission of blood_borne pathogens , to prevent reuse , and to prevent resale after use ( lloyd and milstien 1999 ) . the model auto disable syringes before and after use are shown in fig . 4 . the united_nations international children emergency fund ( unicef ) stockpiles auto disable syringes for the covid_19 vaccines global access ( covax ) campaign as a precautionary measure to ensure that the waste does not reach children . there have been a few instances where children have used them as toys . to avoid this , unicef is procuring 1 billion auto_disable syringes by the end of 2021 ( unicef 2021 ) . different sizes of syringes and nee_ dles are needed for different vaccines , and the selection criteria depend on the dosage capacity and injection sites , such as subcutaneous , intramuscular , and intradermal . typical injection syringe range includes 0.3 , 0.5 , 1.0 , 2.0 , and 5.0 ml ( cancaster 2015 ) .fused_quartz vials fused_quartz vials , made up of 99.99 % pure silicon dioxide with an exceptionally inert nature , provide a ready_to_use format for fill_finish operations . the largest fused_quartz vial producer , momentive technologies , has recently introduced its ultra_high purity vials ( pur q® ) to the stevanto group ez_fill® format . in addition to its excellent inertness , a low coefficient of thermal_expansion makes pur q® extremely resistant to thermal_shock , thus making it suitable for a wide range of storage temperatures ( stevanato 2020 ) . stoppers and seals every vaccine candidate using vials relies on stoppers and seals . stoppers protect from environmental impacts , whereas seals are critical for ensuring drug protection , container clo_ sure integrity , and safety . a protective fluoropolymer barrier layer applied on an elastomer ( latex_free ) acts as a barrier to the migration of elastomer components to the drug . stop_ pers , a part of the closure system , can be autoclaved prior to dispatch , provided as a sterile component along with vials , or can be sterilized at fill_finish lines ( west 2021 ; shanley 2020 ) . for example , janssen has used chlorobutyl rubber stopper along with aluminum crimp and a blue plastic flip_ off for its covid_19 vaccine packaging . some of commer _ cially available covid_19 vaccines are shown in table 2 . packaging system for vaccines distribution the packaging system for distribution plays a predominant role in delivering the vaccines to the ultimate consumers in suitable condition and at right time . a typical packag_ ing system for distribution includes secondary and tertiary drug formulation of vaccine protective layer barrier layer adhesive laye r polymer layer fig . 3 multilayered structure of filled sio2 smart vial made with hybrid material consisting of a protective nanoglass layer along with cyclic olefin polymeric layer table 1 standard dimensions for type i molded glass vials by vaccine manufacturers , as per the international organization for standardiza_ tion . source : sgd ( 2018 ) nominal volume ( ml ) brim full volume ( ml ) weight ( g ) height ( mm ) neck finish ( mm ) outer diameter ( mm ) 5 7 14 41.30 20 20.80 8 10 16 46.80 20 23.00 10 15 21 53.50 20 25.40 15 17 24 58.80 20 26.50 20 26 29 58.00 20 32.00 circlip befor e usecirclip after use plungerflangeplunger tipneedle ( a ) ( b ) fig . 4 single_use auto_disable syringe for coronavirus disease vac__cine doses and components a before use and b after use 3601 environmental_chemistry letters ( 2021 ) 19:3597–3608 1 3 packaging , and cushioning materials to protect the glass vials ( primary package ) from breaks and cracks during transport and storage . a cold_chain is required for some vaccine candidates to safeguard the vaccine until it reaches the injection point . table 3 provides an overview of the packaging systems involved and materials used at each level of vaccine packaging.secondary packaging once the vaccines are produced at the manufacturers ’ facil_ ity , they need to be shipped to multiple locations . vials/ ampoules/leaflets are packed in secondary cartons to opti_ mize their volume and weight for transport and storage . the number of primary_packaging units per secondary carton table 2 commercially available coronavirus disease vaccines with packaging capacity , dimensions and storage conditions vaccine ’ s com_ mercial namevaccine manu_ facturerprimary pack _ aging capacity ( ml ) primary pack _ aging materialstopper/ seal materialstorage condi_ tionsrefrigeration storage dura_ tionsecondary dimen_ sions comi rnat y® pfizer inc_ biontech , united_states of america2 clear glass vial ( type 1 ) synthetic bromobutyl rubber/ flip_off plastic cap with alu_ minum− 80 to − 60 °c 2 to 8 °c6 months 5 days9″ l × 9″ w × 1.7″ h moderna modernatx , inc united_states of america5 clear glass vial ( type 1 ) chlorobutyl rubber/ aluminum with flip off plastic cap− 25 to − 15 °c 2 to 8 °c6 months 30 days5.5″ l × 2.2″ w × 2.5″ h janssen janssen_cilag international n.v. , belgium2.5 2r clear glass vial ( type 1 ) chlorobutyl with fluoropol_ ymer coated surface/ aluminum crimp with a blue plastic flip_off− 25 to − 15 °c 2 to 8 °c24 months 3 months3.66″ l × 1.5″ w × 2.13″ h covishieldtm serum institute of india pvt . ltd , india2 , 5 clear glass vial ( type 1 ) elastomeric/ aluminum flip_off plastic button2 to 8 °c 6 months 7.28″ l × 3.74″ w × 2.36″ h sputnik v gamaleya national research centre , russia– – − 18.5 °c ( liq_ uid form ) 2 to 8 °c ( dry form ) _ 2 months– covaxi ntm bharat biotech , india5 , 10 transparent glass vial ( type 1 ) butyl_rubber/ flip off plastic cap with alu_ minum2 to 8 °c 6 months 3.94″ l × 3.94″ w × 2.16 h 3602 environmental_chemistry letters ( 2021 ) 19:3597–3608 1 3 can be determined based on the domestic and international supply . assumptions can be made based on existing vaccine packaging patterns ; however , a clear set of guidelines have not been provided for upcoming vaccines in the past ( who 2009 ) . secondary packaging can be influential in terms of reducing volume , cost_saving , minimizing logistical burden , and ultimately reducing the carbon footprint . two decades ago , the who was requested for the strengthening of pack _ aging standards by changing the secondary carton capacity from 5 to 10 primary units to 50–100 primary units per car _ ton . apparently , this could reduce shipping costs , minimize dead space , and reduce the number of cold boxes required ( newland 2011 ) . a secondary packaging model for vac__cines is shown in fig . 5a . the following examples show the dimensions and capacity of secondary packaging units developed by recent covid_19 vaccine candidates ( holm and poland 2021 ) . the secondary carton dimensions for other vaccine candidates are given in table 2 . 1 . pfizer vaccine comes in a 2 ml vial with a secondary carton containing 195 primary_packaging units with an approximate size of l 8.13″ x w 8.13″ x h 1.75 ” . 2 . moderna ’ s mrna vaccine contains 10 primary packag_ ing units for each secondary carton with an approximate size of l 5.5″ x w 2.2″ x h 2.5 ” the vaccine presentation and packaging advisory group ( vppag ) recommends that the vaccine manufacturers pre_ pare formats that could minimize the number of steps and eliminate errors during preparation and administration . the vppag recommendations are listed in table 4 . for sec_ ondary packaging units , vials packed in rectangular arrays with 5 or 10 vial units along with standardized diameter table 3 types of materials used at each level of vaccine packagingcomponents of vaccine packaging materials primary_packaging ( vial ) clear glass type_i , cyclic olefin polymer with nanolayer glass , coated aluminum silicate valor glass closure rubber stopper and crimped aluminum seal labeling and leaflet paper secondary packaging fiberboard box , plastic trays with vial trays tertiary packaging corrugated_fiberboard box , thermally insulated plastic containers fig . 5 typical packaging system for vaccines containing a second_ ary packaging and b tertiary packaging . adapted and modified from intelsius : zhang et al .

the end_of_life handling of materials secondary and tertiary materials , including labels , should be long term resistant to condensation and standard relative_humidity ( 75 % relative_humidity ) 3603 environmental_chemistry letters ( 2021 ) 19:3597–3608 1 3 and height could provide better dimensional harmonization . the secondary carton size should be optimally decided to accommodate vials , packaging inserts , and internal dividers ( who 2009 ) . tertiary packaging tertiary packaging is the most prevalent packaging for the shipping and transportation of vaccines . they have numer _ ous advantages over other forms of packaging materials . for international shipments , outer_insulated boxes are used as shipping units , either alone or as pallet shippers . they are characterized by physical integrity , can retain their proper _ ties , and can withstand mechanical manipulation , repeated manual handling , and various climatic conditions . accord_ ing to who recommendations , insulated boxes should weigh less than 50 kg , as they can be handled manually at airports and other distribution centers ( who 2005 ) . these boxes are not seen by consumers as retailers remove them before they reach the point of end use . generally , card_ boards , plane boxes , and shrink wraps are used in tertiary packaging ( ankur 2018 ) . a model of the tertiary packag _ ing is shown in fig . 5b . the recommendations made by the vppag are as follows : 1 . it should be tested and qualified to withstand anticipated loads , shocks , and vibrations during transportation and distribution . 2 . dimensional harmony is vital for stock management , and tertiary cartons can be helpful . 3 . it should be a more convenient and robust stock_keeping unit than the secondary packaging unit . 4 . the width of the tertiary cartons must be in accordance with the available shelf width of cold rooms and freezer rooms , i.e. , 45–60 cm . 5 . to take into account the stock , contents inside the ter _ tiary packaging must be arranged in multiples of 50 or 100 units . 6 . the european economic community ( eec ) council directive 90/269/eec states that the maximum weight of a tertiary carton should be in such a way that a person can lift it safely . 7 . the tertiary carton dimensions are selected as per iso standardized pallets with dimensions 1.2 m × 0.8 m or 1.0 m × 1.2 m so that these can be efficiently stacked without overlapping individual pallet ’ s footprint . briefly , secondary packaging contributes a lot in optimiz_ ing the volume utilization by increasing no . of primary units from 5–10 to 50–100 . the reduction in weight without com_ promising the other functions of tertiary packaging could benefit environment.labeling system for vaccine package “ labelling makes the invisible visible , but an improper label can put the patients ’ life in jeopardy. ” an unambigu_ ous label is indispensable rather than consequential for a successful immunization program . the labeling system contains primary container labels , secondary carton and tertiary container labels , leaflets , packaging inserts , bar codes , quick response codes and vaccine vial monitors ( vvms ) . primary container label a primary container label is vital in identifying the right drug , its mode of injection , and the minimum quantity required per dose . the clearer the label , the more error_ free is the vaccination program . according to a previous survey ( path 2021 ) , approximately 94 % of healthcare pro_ viders agreed that vaccine package labels are crucial for their work . this shows the importance of the label and urges vaccine manufacturers to follow the relevant stand_ ards . the vaccine presentation and packaging advisory group ( vppag ) had come across two genuine labeling issues : minimum font size for legibility and expiry date format . based on the analysis conducted , this advisory group recommended the who for improvements and standardization in future vaccine labels . as text legibil_ ity is directly related to the quantity of text , the advisory group has recommended standardizing and minimizing information on primary_packaging labels . the use of multiple languages further decreases the label ’ s space and forces manufacturers to use the minimum font size . the use of different expiry date formats on labels has caused ambiguity among consumers in the past . the major prob_ lem is with numerical formats such as 02–04_12 , which can be treated as both february 04 and april 02 . this can be avoided by standardizing an all_numeric format for the expiry date , mm_yyyy , as presented in table 5 . vaccine labels should not limit the ability of healthcare providers to see through the contents of the vials . to avoid this , manufacturers are requested to provide a minimum view _ ing area for the contents in the vials ( who 2009 ) . vials are widely accepted as the primary_packaging material for covid_19 vaccines . the who has been preparing and issuing model labels as guidance to man_ ufacturers to standardize the label requirements for the covax program . it has issued a working position for a vial label , as shown in fig . 6 . it should contain the name of the vaccine , the manufacturer ’ s name , storage condi_ tions , manufacturing , and expiry date , batch/lot num_ ber , volume per dose , doses per container , and leaflet or 3604 environmental_chemistry letters ( 2021 ) 19:3597–3608 1 3 package insert for other details . to summarize , a primary container label is essential for any medical product . a label with a clear understanding of necessary information is a good fit . secondary and tertiary packaging labels secondary and tertiary carton labels ease the process of identification and distinguish similar types of vac__cines during storage and distribution , thus minimizing the errors in selecting a product and can help in accu_ rate stock counting and management . to achieve the abovementioned targets , secondary and tertiary cartons must be labeled at least on two opposite faces , as per the guidelines for labeling of vaccines , proposed amendments to the technical report series ( trs ) 822 , and require_ ment for prequalified products . the printed content must contain both static and dynamic information , such as bar codes and quick response codes that can be printed on one face only ( who 2009 ) . to unify the labeling system for the immunization program , the who has recommended the manufacturers to follow model carton labeling as shown in fig . 7.package inserts the package insert is a part of the labeling system , as complete information about the product and its use can_ not be specified on the primary package . therefore , vac _ cine manufacturers should supply mandatory information such as product information , prescription information , and risks involved with the drug . package inserts contain product information in an advanced technical language that might confuse healthcare providers and patients . to avoid such ambiguity , a simplified fact sheet called the patient information leaflet ( pil ) can be additionally supplied by the manufacturer . pil contains basic infor _ mation regarding prescription and administration routes translated in the local language , based on the country to which it is exported , to reduce the risk of administrative error . regulatory requirements are necessary to monitor the location and content of package inserts . often , the use of package inserts makes secondary cartons bulky , lead_ ing to increased disposable volume . to overcome waste_disposal and increase secondary packaging volume , patient information leaflets should be available in digital formats and can be downloaded online from the who vaccine database ( who 2009 ; thornton 2003 ) . manufacturers are recommended to follow the standard who format for package inserts to avoid such ambiguity at the grassroots level . different countries follow their own regulations . according to the european commission regulation no . 726/2004 , all approved medicinal products should contain both patient information leaflet and a summary of prod_ uct characteristics ( dijk et al . 2014 ) . in contrast , usfda has brought the fair packaging and labeling act_1966 to accurately label the consumer products such as foods , drugs , cosmetics , and medical devices . along with that the code_of_federal_regulations ( cfr ) —title 21 for food and drugs , part 201 , sect . 201.56 & 201.57—specifies the latest requirements for “

) 19:3597–3608 1 3 human prescription_drug and biological products ” ( watson and barash 2009 ; nathan and vider 2015 ) . bar codes barcodes and quick response codes come under the category of data carriers , which are one way readable . they facilitate information about the product in an electronic version ( gs1 2021 ) . when read with the help of scanners , the data are ana_ lyzed digitally and reproduced to the consumer . in the case of vaccines , this technology is being used as a supplement for printed information about the product . barcodes are lin_ ear in nature and simply store information about the vaccine expiration_date and lot number ( who 2020d ) . the compo_ nents of a linear barcode include a 12_digit serial number called the global trading identification number ( gtin ) and a series of bars and spaces . the gtin has a deciphered mean_ ing : the first two digits give the country code , and the follow _ ing digits provide details about the manufacturer , product , and batch ( gtin 2015 ) . they are recommended for use in primary and secondary packaging . quick response codes are 2d barcodes that are designed as a square modulus arranged within a perimeter ( kuswandi and jumina 2020 ) . they store every piece of information printed on primary_packaging and packaging inserts , including the route of administra_ tion , date of manufacture/expiration , batch number , doses per vial , dosage , temperature requirements , and sometimes information about the manufacturer for traceability purposes ( who 2020d ) . it is highly suggested that they can be added to secondary packaging as well . recently , the centers_for_disease_control and prevention has been encouraging 2d barcodes to be added to the vaccine information statement for the covid_19 vaccine to help both patients and practi_ tioners ( cdc 2021 ) . vaccine vial monitors incorporation of vaccine vial monitors into primary pack _ aging is considered a preferred characteristic for primary_packaging . it is a type of sensor that helps determine the vac__cine ’ s history of any exposure to cumulative heat over time , as shown in fig . 8 . it is made of a heat_sensitive material , comes in a small circle with a square inside , and is printed on the label or cap of the vaccine . with the darkened color of the inner square compared to the outer circle , vaccine vial monitors indicates that the vial has been exposed to critical temperatures and should no longer be used . this visual indi_ cation successfully decreases the risk of administration of sub_potent vaccines . the color change is a continuous pro_ cess and is irreversible , making them more reliable . vaccine fig . 7 model label for cartons for coronavirus disease vaccines according to who guidelines . adapted

2009 ) . anti‑counterfeiting features in vaccine packaging the pharmaceutical industry is more vulnerable to counter _ feit medical products . a survey conducted by international_data_corporation ( idc ) in june 2020 revealed that approxi_ mately 70 % of manufacturers agreed on the vulnerability of their supply_chain , if covid_19 continued for a couple of months and approximately 75 % of companies agreed to an increase in theft , diversion , or counterfeiting of vaccines , test kits , and antivirals ( forcinio 2021 ) . vaccine manufacturers should be aware of the fake covid_19 vaccines entering the market . a study conducted by the authentication solution providers association of india revealed that counterfeiters do not produce vaccines , they just fool people by duplicat_ ing the vaccine packaging while putting harmful or inactive contents inside . a recent interpol global alert to law enforce_ ment agencies in 194 member countries against organized networks targeting covid_19 vaccines provides evidence of the severity of the situation ( outlook 2021 ) . in order to curb counterfeiting , laws , and regulations have been formulated by various agencies such as the european union ’ s falsified medicine directive and the us ’ s drug supply_chain security act ( forcinio 2021 ) . the who also constituted a task force unit in 2006 , the international medi_ cal products anti_counterfeiting taskforce ( impact ) , to fight against the multi_million_dollar illegal trade of coun_ terfeit drugs and vaccines ( who 2020e ) . anti‑counterfeiting measures with advancements in technologies and maintaining con_ sumer safety as a concern , pharmaceutical companies are focusing on tailor_made anti_counterfeit solutions . a mul_ tilevel security approach with a tailor_made use , along with digital and analog techniques verified by multiple stakehold _ ers within the supply_chain , is necessary for anti_counterfeit products ( forcinio 2021 ) . labeling techniques , such as tamper_evident labels and holograms , can help reduce the counterfeiting of a product . other methods such as radio frequency identification devices and near_field commu_ nication tags could also help fight against counterfeiters . magnetic ink is another vital tool developed by inspectron , which prints a barcode that the naked_eye can not read . the serialized code printed inside a carton or under a label can be read from a 2 mm distance by a specific reader . trutag technologies has a unique product_level authentication tech_ nology , on_dose , which uses edible microparticles combined with smart medicine , and confirms product authenticity . another technique from applied dna sciences received the nod from usfda to its molecular tagging technology , which gives immutable identity to both dose and packag_ ing . alpvision ’ s covid_19 initiative provides a new tool , cryptoglyph digital security , to pharmaceutical companies . cryptoglyph is invisible to the human eye and can only be authenticated by a smartphone , which connects to alpvi_ sion ’ s brand monitoring system for real_time monitoring of product authentication ( forcinio 2021 ; bansal et al . 2013 ) . overall , nearly 70 % of existing supply_chains are vulnerable to counterfeiting . there is a need to establish dedicated regu_ latory bodies , more stringent actions , and security features to be added to anti_counterfeit medical products . conclusion packaging is a potential tool for immunization programs . the unforeseen challenges related to the safe packaging and distribution of the covid_19 vaccine have created an opportunity for packaging developers to strategically develop and innovate vaccine packaging systems . advance_ ments in developing new materials and access to cutting_ edge technology have given vaccine developers a huge scope in providing vaccines in an effective and affordable manner . vials used in traditional vaccine packaging have seen a new phase of development by the introduction of hybrid materi_ als , such as coated aluminosilicate valor glass and cyclic olefin polymer with a glass nanolayer . another challenge that needs to be addressed is underlining a new set of regu_ lations for better protection of vaccines in terms of pack _ aging , labeling , and distribution . this requires synergistic efforts from the governments , who , and other governing bodies . technologies such as the internet of things , block _ chain technology , and artificial neural_networks can also be used to monitor real_time data and implement cold_chain distribution of vaccines . finally , advanced studies on the prospective application of intelligent packaging should also be conducted to prevent any crisis in the future . acknowledgements

commentary all vials are not the same : potential role of vaccine quality in vaccine adverse_reactions yihua bruce yu⇑ , marc b. taraban , katharine t. briggs bio_ and nano_technology center , university of maryland school of pharmacy , baltimore , md 21201 , usa institute for bioscience and biotechnology research , 9600 gudelsky drive , rockville , md 20850 , usa 1 . introduction a recent commentary in this journal proposes looking beyond polyethylene glycols ( peg ) when investigating anaphylactic reac_ tions to mrna covid_19 vaccines [ 1 ] . it suggests examining other ingredients in those vaccines as potential causes of anaphylaxis . we agree with the need to broaden the scope when investigating vaccine adverse_reactions , but we propose going beyond vaccine ingredients . a recent study reported that 581 people with anaphy_ laxis histories from previous vaccine shots did not develop anaphy_ laxis after receiving the pﬁzer/biontech mrna covid_19 vaccine [ 2 ] , suggesting that the vaccine ingredients might not always be the cause for anaphylaxis associated with this vaccine . while both active and inactive ingredients of a vaccine may be the cause of some adverse_reactions , another possible cause to consider is sub_ par quality of the individual vial . we suggest taking the quality of individual vaccine vials into account in an adverse_reaction investigation , i.e. , a serious adverse_reaction , anaphylaxis or other types , might be caused by one defec_ tive vial out of many good_quality vials . an argument for this pos_ sibility is that vaccine adverse_reactions are not always reproducible on re_exposure [ 3 ] , which hints at an element of chance . for example , a recent retrospective study found that 159 patients who had immediate reactions to the ﬁrst_dose of mrna covid_19 vaccines , including 19 individuals with anaphylaxis after the ﬁrst_dose , tolerated the second dose [ 4 ] . the reason for this is unclear at this time . it is not inconceivable that the ﬁrst and second doses may respectively involve vials of different qual_ ity , and therefore elicit different responses from a person . when the defect rate is low , it is highly unlikely that a given person will receive two bad doses in a row . for example , if the defect rate is 1 per 105 , the probability that a given person receiving two bad doses is 10_10 . indeed , focusing entirely on vaccine ingredients in adverse reac_ tion investigations may leave an investigation unsolved when good_quality ingredients are not the cause . in sweden , high counts of narcolepsy were noticed after immunization with pandemrix ( an h1n1 inﬂuenza vaccine ) in 2009 [ 5 ] . investigations thatfocused on the adjuvant in pandemrix failed to establish a causal link between narcolepsy and the adjuvant [ 6 ] . to this date , the cause has not been identiﬁed [ 7 ] . the culprit might have been a few defective vials in the batch delivered exclusively to sweden rather than the adjuvant or other ingredients . collecting quality data on every vial before injection might have prevented those nar_ colepsy incidents , but such a practice is not currently in place . in fact , the current quality_control system for vaccines is not well equipped to catch a few defective vials among many good_quality ones unless the defects are visible to human eyes . in this commentary , we introduce an emerging noninvasive inspection technology—water proton nuclear_magnetic_resonance ( wnmr ) —that could be used for fast and reliable quantitative inspection of sealed and labelled vials of liquid drug products . wnmr could be used to quantitatively inspect every vial before product release at the production site , before injection at the vac_ cination site , and anywhere in between . we discuss vials in this commentary , but other primary containers for liquid drug products such as syringes , pens , bottles , etc. , could also be inspected by wnmr . 2 . the current system for vaccine quality_control quality_control ( qc ) for vaccines and drugs is conducted at the batch level , not at the individual vial level . speciﬁcally , extensive quantitative testing is conducted at each and every step of vaccine manufacturing , up to the point of the puriﬁed bulk drug substance ( ds ) . the ds then goes through the ﬁll_ﬁnish unit operations to become the drug product ( dp ) , i.e. , the sealed and labelled vials ready for distribution . at the dp level , not all vials in a batch are tested quantitatively because testing requires opening sealed vials and drawing out the content for analysis . once a vial is opened or punctured , its integrity is compromised and therefore is no longer suited for release . consequently , quantitative invasive testing is performed only on a small fraction of ﬁnished vials in each batch , a process called statistical sampling . the current qc system collects data on none of the released vials . therefore , the quality of released vials is inferred from the quality of the few randomly selected vials opened and tested at the production site [ 8 ] . such a qc system operates on the premise that all vials in a batch are the same , or sufﬁciently alike , when https : //doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.09.065 0264_410x/ /c2112021 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.⇑corresponding author . e_mail address : byu @ rx.umaryland.edu ( y. bruce yu ) .vaccine 39 ( 2021 ) 6565–6569 contents lists available at sciencedirect vaccine journal homepage : www.else vier.com/locate/vaccine manufactured and remain the same all the way to injection . but all vials are not the same due to manufacturing and handling variabil_ ities . many factors , starting from the ﬁll_ﬁnish unit operations and throughout the distribution process , may affect product quality at the individual vial level , and these could be overlooked in batch_ level qc . 3 . all vials are not the same due to manufacturing and handling variabilities 3.1 . manufacturing variability no two objects can be made identical , be they two light bulbs , two cars , or two vials of a vaccine ; there is always some object_ to_object variability . of course , variability does not necessarily mean defective products ; it depends on the type and extent of vari_ ability . pharmaceutical manufacturing , in general , is not very pre_ cise , at a_level of 2_3 r , with 2 rquality corresponding to 308,537 defects per 106opportunities [ 9 ] . the precision for vaccine manu_ facturing may be even less than 2_3 rbecause vaccine manufactur_ ing is more complex than most pharmaceuticals , rendering manufacturing errors more likely . with this level of manufacturing precision , it is up to the qc system to detect and remove defective intermediates and ﬁnal products . the current qc system is well_equipped to catch defects that occur before the ﬁll_ﬁnish unit operations , but it may miss defects that occur at the ﬁll_ﬁnish unit operations and beyond . starting from the ﬁll_ﬁnish unit operations , the quality of individual vials might diverge . for example , in 2013 , a ﬁll_ﬁnish error caused the insulin level in 0.14 % insulin pens in multiple batches to deviate from the target value by up to ±50 % [ 10 ] . there was at least one report of a serious adverse_reaction associated with one of the recalled batches [ 11 ] . four weeks later , 33 batches of 3.3 million insulin pens were recalled [ 10 ] . the frequency or degree of meeting the quality standards in manufacturing is often not measured , reported , or made publicly available [ 9 ] . it would be unrealistic to expect a zero defect rate for any vaccine or drug product . the smaller the defect rate , the more likely the defective vials will escape sampling_based qcand get released . the 0.14 % error rate ( 1,400 per 10 6 ) that occurred in the ﬁll_ﬁnish unit operations of the insulin product is not very low but nonetheless evaded detection . however , if every insulin pen was quantitatively inspected before release using noninvasive analytical technologies , such as wnmr , individual pens with ﬁlling errors above a preset acceptable level could have been detected and removed from the batch [ 12 ] . 3.2 . handling variability once deemed releasable by qc testing , a batch of vaccines will go through the distribution process to reach vaccination sites . for some vaccines , there are additional handling procedures right before injection . for example , both the pﬁzer/biontech and the moderna mrna covid_19 vaccines require thawing before injec_ tion , and the pﬁzer/biontech vaccine further requires dilution after thawing . in mass vaccination programs , handling variability , including mishandling of various types , is hardly avoidable . the most extreme examples of covid_19 vaccine mishandling include intentionally leaving vaccines outside the freezer in wisconsin [ 13 ] , and unintentionally vaccinating people with expired vaccines in new york [ 14 ] . less extreme but much more common mishan_ dling is cold_chain breaches . most vaccines require cold_chain for distribution . the regular cold_chain is 2–8 /c176c . however , some vaccines require more strin_ gent cold chains . for example , the pﬁzer/biontech and modernamrna covid_19 vaccines , respectively , require /c070/c176c and /c020/c176c for distribution . cold_chain breaches , in general , are not rare . in 2012 , the inspector general of the department of health and human services issued a report entitled ‘ ‘ vaccines for children program : vulnerabilities in vaccine management ” [ 15 ] . the report identiﬁed multiple vulnerabilities in the distribution of vaccines for children ( vfc ) in the united_states . key ﬁndings include that 76 % of providers had exposed vfcs to inappropriate temperatures for at least 5 cumulative hours in a 2_week period . all 45 providers had recorded temperatures that differed from independently mea_ sured temperatures during the 2_week period . another study pub_ lished by industry scientists in 2018 also found that exposing vaccines to incorrect storage temperature is not rare in the us [ 16 ] . cold_chain breaches do not necessarily make a vaccine vial defective ; it depends on the temperature and exposure duration.although the u.s. has many checks in place , without quantitative inspection of individual vials before injection , it is impossible to know whether any vial has become defective . in addition to cold_chain breaches , other types of handling vari_ ability are also hard to avoid . examples include agitation during transportation , exposure to sunlight during storage , duration of thawing , precision of dilution , etc . the cumulative effects of man_ ufacturing and handling variabilities may lead to signiﬁcant vial_ to_vial variability at vaccination sites . 3.3 . vial_to_vial variability at vaccination sites manufacturing variability occurs before product release while handling variability occurs between product release and injection . these two variabilities combined may render the vaccine vials in a batch sufﬁciently different at vaccination sites , i.e. , vial_to_vial variability . in our own work , we demonstrated the effectiveness ofwnmr to detect freezing variability among vials from the same carton of aluminum_adjuvanted vaccines [ 17 ] . of course , freezing variability may or may not translate into differences in safety and efﬁcacy . the observation simply shows that vial_to_vial vari_ ability indeed exists . a recent example of vial_to_vial variability is that 39 vials of the moderna mrna covid_19 vaccine were found to contain foreign materials at multiple vaccination sites in japan [ 18 ] . three men died within days after receiving their second dose of the vaccine . on september 10 , 2021 , a japanese health ministry panel stated that it does not have enough information to determine whether there is a causal link between the three deaths and the vaccine [ 19 ] . moderna recalled three lots of the vaccine and issued a state_ ment saying that the most probable cause of the foreign materials were a result of friction between two improperly aligned machin_ ery components during manufacturing , and this caused stainlesssteel particulates to end up in some vials [ 20 ] . it appears , the affected vials were only distributed to japan . fortunately , in this case , the foreign materials , millimeter in size , were large enough to be visible to the human eye so that they were caught at vaccination sites . but how they escaped pre_release visual inspection is puzzling . moreover , not all defects are visible tothe human eye . if visible defects can escape qc detection , the chance of subvisible defects escaping qc detection is likely even higher . some subvisible defects , such as a wrong dose , might occur before product release , while other subvisible defects , such as frag_ mented or aggregated ingredients , might emerge after product release . quantitative inspection of every vial before injection may help to catch defective vials and thereby prevent some adverse_reactions . if vial_to_vial variability indeed plays a role in vaccine adverse_reactions , then the complexity of the distribution and handling procedures might affect the rate of adverse_reactions . the rationale is that more complex procedures might lead to greater producty . bruce yu , m.b . taraban and k.t . briggs vaccine 39 ( 2021 ) 6565–6569 6566 variability at vaccination sites . for the two mrna covid_19 vacci_ nes , the anaphylactic reaction rate was 4.7 and 2.5 per 106doses , respectively , for pﬁzer/biontech and moderna vaccines [ 1 ] . this might be due to ingredient differences between the two vaccines . but it is also possible that the higher anaphylactic rate of the pﬁ_ zer/biontech vaccine is due , at least in part , to its more stringent cold_chain requirement ( /c070/c176c ) and more complex handling pro_ cedure ( dilution before injection ) . the fact that 19 people who developed anaphylaxis after the ﬁrst_dose of the mrna covid_ 19 vaccines could tolerate the second dose [ 4 ] also suggests that vial_to_vial variability might be at play . as mentioned earlier , prob_ abilistically , it is unlikely that the same person would receive two bad doses in a row . 4 . the case for vial_level qc 4.1 . defective products and sensitive populations together may result in adverse_reactions as discussed above , all vials are not the same ; some might be defective . but not all defective vials will cause adverse_reactions . depending on the severity and nature of the defect , defective vials might only cause adverse_reactions in some people ( sensitive pop_ ulations ) , but not in all people . in other words , adverse_reactions to vaccines and drugs might be the result of both vial_speciﬁc and person_speciﬁc factors . a prior occurrence of this type was during a clinical_trial of the erythropoietin analog hx575 for treating anemia . of the 174 par_ ticipants receiving hx575 , two developed neutralizing_antibodies against erythropoietin , an endogenous glycoprotein . of the two participants , one developed pure red cell aplasia and one died of myocardial_infarction . the trial was terminated [ 21 ] . later studies revealed that the adverse_events were likely caused by a combina_ tion of participant and product variability [ 22 ] . only some partici_ pants carried certain dna alleles that caused them to be sensitive to protein aggregates , and the protein aggregates were only pre_ sent in some of the pre_ﬁlled syringes of the drug . in fact , the vari_ ation of protein aggregate level in the syringes ranged from below the detection limit up to 5 % . it appears that a few outlier syringes caused harm in a few sensitive individuals . this highlights the need for vial_level qc . 4.2 . random and latent occurrences of product defects are difﬁcult to catch the case of the erythropoietin analog hx575 is instructive in another way : it took over six months for the aggregates to reach detectable levels [ 23 ] . hence the defect was not only random , i.e. , varying from syringe to syringe , but also latent , i.e. , emerging long after product release . although this speciﬁc example is a ther_ apeutic protein , there is no reason to preclude random and latent defects from happening to vaccines . in the absence of vial_level quality data at the point_of_care , severe adverse_reactions caused by random and latent product defects are hard to prevent before injection and hard to investigate after injection . 4.3 . batch_level qc restricts vaccine adverse_reaction investigations because there is no data on individual vials , the current para_ digm in vaccine adverse_reaction investigations is to treat people individually but vaccine vials collectively . speciﬁcally , if person x is vaccinated with vial y of vaccine z and develops a serious adverse_reaction , the investigation will examine the speciﬁc biology of person x and commonalities of all vials of vaccine z , such as peg in mrna covid_19 vaccines . the possibility that vial y is defectiveand thereby causes the adverse_reaction is typically not considered because there is no data on vial y . lack of data on individual vials forces the investigation to oper_ ate under the assumption that person x will develop an adverse_reaction to vaccine z no matter which vial is used . the investiga_ tion will then sample unused vials from the same batch ; vial y is left out of the investigation because it is already gone with no data on its quality left behind . if the sampled , unused vials from the same batch as vial y were found to be of good quality , the investi_ gation may then conclude that there is no evidence of causal link between the adverse_reaction and the vaccine . bach_level qc is not equipped to address directly whether a speciﬁc adverse reac_ tion is caused by a defective vial of vaccine . in essence , lack of vial_level quality data biases vaccine adverse_reaction investigations towards the commonalities of all vials , suchas the ingredients , and ignores the peculiarities of individual vials , such as defects . it is worth putting this bias into perspective . for the two mrna covid_19 vaccines , unless the defect rate of the pﬁ_ zer/biontech and moderna vaccines at vaccination sites is known to be markedly lower than 4.7 and 2.5 per 10 6 , respectively , there is no a priori reason to ignore the possibility that the anaphylactic events were caused by defective vials . focusing solely on common_ alities of all vials may lead the investigation to a dead_end as it was in the above case of high counts of narcolepsy in sweden after immunization with pandemrix [ 5 ] . 4.4 . recalls lead to massive vaccine wastage when a few vials in a batch are found to be defective , often the entire batch can not be used . sometimes , additional batches are put aside out of precaution . one example is the moderna mrna covid vaccine in japan , where 39 vials in one lot were found to contain foreign materials . not only was this lot recalled , but two other lots were also recalled . the reason is that the three lots were manufac_ tured around the same time and on the same manufacturing line [ 18 ] . in total , 1.63 million_doses were recalled because 39 vials were found defective . such extreme precaution , although under_ standable , leads to a huge amount of wastage . it is possible that only a small fraction of vials in these lots are defective ; the rest might be perfectly ﬁne . for example , in the insulin pen recall , only 0.14 % of pens had wrong doses [ 10 ] . the consequence was that 99.84 % of 3.3 million pens ended up wasted . vial_level data hold the potential to pinpoint which vial is defective and which is not , and thereby prevent such wastage . 5 . enhancing vaccine quality_control through quantitative noninvasive inspection at its core , the current paradigm in adverse_reaction investiga_ tions , treating people individually but vaccine vials collectively , stems from our ability to collect quantitative data on every person , but inability to collect quantitative data on every vial . with no data on individual vials , one has no choice but to treat vaccine vials col_ lectively ; the decision to accept or reject vaccine vials is at the batch level , not at the vial level . in the case of severe adverse reac_ tions , it is hard to draw deﬁnitive conclusions based on batch_level data . without vial_level data , an element of guess and chance becomes unavoidable . our current inability to collect quality data on every vial is pri_ marily because the analytical technologies for quality assessment are invasive ; data collection compromises the dp integrity . to build a more robust qc system , noninvasive inspection technolo_ gies that maintain dp integrity are needed , i.e. , technologies that can collect quantitative data on sealed and labelled vials without damaging the ds inside the vials . to collect data on millions andy . bruce yu , m.b . taraban and k.t . briggs vaccine 39 ( 2021 ) 6565–6569 6567 even billions of vials at both manufacturing and vaccination sites , the technologies also need to be fast , affordable , robust , and easy to use . these requirements constitute a tall order . hence , it is worth pointing out what is notneeded from the noninvasive inspection technologies . these technologies are used to detect dp defects that occur after the ﬁll_ﬁnish unit operations , i.e. , after the quality of the bulk drug substance has been assured by invasive analytical technologies . for ﬁnished vials , what is needed from such tech_ nologies is a quick accept/reject decision , with the criteria preset through prior validation/calibration using invasive technologies . there is no need for such noninvasive inspections to provide chem_ ical and biological details when outlier vials are detected ; those details can be provided by invasive analytical technologies on vials ‘ ﬂagged ’ by noninvasive inspection technologies , which may take along time . 6 . water proton nmr : an emerging noninvasive inspection technology inwnmr , the signal source is from the water protons , like a medical mri . however , unlike medical mri , which involves large , expensive equipment and complex , time_consuming procedures , wnmr uses compact inexpensive equipment and simple proce_ dures that take seconds in most cases . we have applied wnmr to noninvasively inspect marketed vaccines and insulin products [ 12,17,24 ] .wnmr is still at its early stages and it will take signiﬁ_ cant engineering efforts to make wnmr suited for inspecting mil_ lions to billons of vials . of course , other noninvasive inspection technologies based on different principles may also be developed . 7 . path forward enhanced qc based on vial_level data may facilitate vaccination programs and help to overcome vaccine hesitancy . we are still a long way from collecting data on every vial of a vaccine . there are technical , ﬁnancial , and regulatory issues to be resolved . the situation is somewhat analogous to taking the genetics or biomark_ ers of every person into account , which also has technical , ﬁnan_ cial , and regulatory issues . as we progress toward precision medicine and vaccination , the point_of_care collection of data on every person and every vial may eventually become the norm . a potential starting point is a clinical_trial that collects data on every vial before injection . by matching genetic and outcome data on every person with quality data on every vial , a better under_ standing on vaccine safety and efﬁcacy might be achieved . while results from one clinical_trial might not be generalizable to all vac_cines , they nonetheless may demonstrate the beneﬁt of inspecting every vial before injection and thereby can spur further develop_ ment in noninvasive inspection technologies and their implementation . for vaccine developers , collecting data on every vial before injection may help prevent giving trial participants subpar or even defective vaccines , which may improve trial success . for example , wnmr can readily detect aggregates in therapeutic protein formu_ lations [ 25 ] . the clinical_trial of the erythropoietin analog hx575 might have been saved had the protein aggregate level in every syringe been quantiﬁed before injection . this commentary highlights the limitations of current vaccine quality_control and adverse_reaction investigations . our intent is to raise awareness and spur development . we are not suggesting that vaccination programs be halted until quality data on every vial are collected . a society functions with what it has and progresses by recognizing and then overcoming its limitations . for vaccine qc and adverse_reaction investigation , the starting point forimprovement , in our view , is recognizing gaps in our knowledge , be it a person ’ s biology or a vial ’ s quality , and then developing enabling technologies to bridge those gaps . for governments and international organizations , investment in enabling technologies for enhanced qc might help to alleviate vaccine hesitancy and could be an integral part of pandemic prevention and control strategy . declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following ﬁnancial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests : yihua bruce

populations served in clinical practices . speci ﬁcally , the critical appraisal skills programme ( casp ) checklists ( critical appraisal skills programme , 2018 ) includes an appraisal tool designed to evaluate rcts . in addition , research journals requirercts to be reported using the consolidated standards ofreporting trials ( consolidated standards of reporting tri_ als , 2010 ) guidelines . thus , we conducted a rigorous analysis using the rct casp tools for the two rcts , p ﬁzer ( polack et al. , 2020 ) and moderna ( baden et al. , 2021 ) , and the reporting of these rcts using the consolidated standardsof reporting trials ( consort ) checklist . the authorspresent the ﬁndings from this analysis which revealed that both the p ﬁzer and moderna vaccine demonstrated safety and ef_ﬁcacy . the goals for this analysis are twofold : ( 1 ) enable health care providers to understand the methods and outcomes of these rcts , and ( 2 ) enable health care pro_ viders and community leaders to become champions for thevaccines to reduce vaccine hesitancy among all populations . general information : covid_19 vaccines both the p ﬁzer and moderna vaccines are messenger ribo_ nucleic_acid ( mrna ) vaccines . the mrna_based vaccineshave advantages in that they do not generate infectious com_ ponents or have the potential to cause infection , do not affect the genes or genome of the person or host_cell , dogenerate a strong immune response with only one or twolow_doses of vaccine , and can be quickly produced in alarge_scale to treat mass populations ( maruggi , zhang , li , ulmer , & yu , 2019 ; wang , kream , & stefano , 2020 ) . once the gene sequence and antigen of the virus pathogen havebeen determined , the mrna vaccine can be rapidly pro_ duced . in addition , the success of mrna vaccines for can_ cer and viral pathogens in creating antigen_speci ﬁc immune responses has been studied and documented since the 1990s ( maruggi et al. , 2019 ) . the bnt162b2 mrna vaccine from p ﬁzer is a lipid nanoparticle_formulated vaccine that encodes a prefusionstabilized full_length spike_protein of the virus that causescovid_19 , sars_cov_2 ( polack et al. , 2020 ) . the mrna_ 1273 vaccine from moderna also encodes the full_length spike_protein and is similar in composition to the p ﬁzer vac__cine ( baden et al. , 2021 ) . once the vaccine is injected into the person or host , the mrna protein is processed byimmune cells that produce the targeted protein directly ( wang et al. , 2020 ) . this replication of proteins subsequently activates b cells and t cells to recognize the newly producedviral protein and make antibodies against sars_cov_2 ( wang et al. , 2020 ) . methodology for rct in appraising the phase three rcts of the vaccines , thecasp checklist for rcts was used systematically for boththe p ﬁzer and moderna vaccine articles . the checklist for this critical appraisal tool comprises 11 questions designedwith prompts to explore details of the study , focusingon the validity of results , the details of the results , and whether the results are helpful ( critical appraisal skills pro_ gramme , 2018 ) . we present our analysis using each question on the casp tool while comparing the methodology andresults for each vaccine . deﬁnitions of ef_ﬁcacy versus effectiveness two terms , ef_ﬁcacy and effectiveness , are used to assess health care interventions ( haynes , 1999 ) . efﬁcacy is de ﬁned as “ the extent to which an intervention does more good than harm under ideal circumstances ” ( haynes , 1999 , p. 1 ) . effectiveness is de ﬁned as a means of “ assessing whether an intervention does more good than harm when providedunder usual circumstances of health care practice ” ( haynes , 1999 , p. 1 ) . both rcts report on the ef_ﬁcacy of the vaccines in preventing severe sars_cov_2 disease in individualswho were in rcts to assess the ef_ﬁcacy of the vaccines . the effectiveness of the vaccines will be determined whendata become available when a large number of individuals receive the vaccines in populations in the united_states and throughout the world . p ﬁzer and moderna used different statistical methodologies to determine vaccine ef_ﬁcacy . what is vaccine efficacy , and what do the reported probabilities mean ? pﬁzer vaccine ef_ﬁcacy ( ve ) describes the impact of the vaccine on the primary endpoint of infection . ve is often misinter_preted as the percentage of vaccinated individuals who willnot become infected when exposed to the virus . what ve does re ﬂect is the probability of infection in the treatment group as compared with the placebo group . speci ﬁcally , it is calculated as 1 /c0 ( p treatment /pcontrol ) , where ptreatment = the probability or rate of infection in the treatment group , andp control = the probability of infection in the control group . ve can range from 0 % ( vaccine offers no protection frominfection ) to 100 % ( complete protection ) . in the study sam_ple , it was found that the rate of infection in the vaccination group was 4.9 % that of the placebo group , and so ve is determined to be 95 % . because these results are based on sample data ( and not the entire population ) , we need to determine the likelihoodof this result of the ve in the larger population . this isdone using the null_hypothesis that ve is ≤30 % ( prespeci_ ﬁed criterion ) . the bayesian beta_binomial model was used to calculate the likelihood that the true ve in the population exceeds this threshold ( > 30 % ) on the basis of the effect observed in the sample ( yang , gilbert , longini , & halloran , 2008 ) . this is the 99.9 % probability that is reported . that is , given the ﬁndings in the sample ( ve = 95 % ) , there is a 99.9 % likelihood that the true effect of the vaccine ( ve ) inthe population exceeds 30 % . the bayesian methods for cal_culating the probability of ve are standard methods andprovide assurance of ve . 444 volume 35 /c15number 4 journal of pediatric health care/c210 moderna moderna used different statistical_methods to assess ve , using a strati ﬁed cox proportional hazards model to deter_ mine the percentage of hazard reduction associated with thevaccine relative to the placebo . however , the statistical meth_ods achieved comparable outcomes for the analysis of ve at94.1 % as the p ﬁzer rct . ve was assessed for all partici_ pants who received at least one dose of the moderna vaccineon the basis of a modi ﬁed intention_to_treat based on the population who received the vaccine without evidence of covid_19 disease on day 1 before the ﬁrst vaccine was administered and participants who received two doses of thevaccine without a deviation from the protocol ( baden et al. , 2021 ) . this statistical methodology also provides assurance of ve . question one : did the trial address a clearly focused issue ? pﬁzer yes , the p ﬁzer rct focused on the “ safety and ef ﬁcacyﬁnd_ ings from the phase 2/3 part of a global phase 1/2/3 trialevaluating the safety , immunogenicity , and ef_ﬁcacy of 30 ug of bnt162b2 in preventing covid_19 in persons 16_yearsof age and older ” ( polack et al. , 2020 , p. 2 ) . individuals admitted to the clinical_trial were healthy or had stable chronic medical conditions . individuals excluded from the study were those who had a medical history of havingcovid_19 disease , treatment with immunosuppressivetherapy , or diagnosis with an immunocompromising condi_tion . the primary endpoints for p ﬁzer rct were data soli_ cited from an electronic diary from study participantsconcerning local or systemic adverse_events and the use ofantipyretics within 7 days of receiving the vaccine . the major secondary endpoint for the p ﬁzer vaccine was the ef_ﬁcacy of the vaccine to protect against severe covid_19 disease.the intervention of the p ﬁzer vaccine bnt162b2 , an mrna vaccine , was administered in a two_dose regimen of30mg per dose , with 0.3 ml per dose , administered in the deltoid , 21 days apart . the placebo control group received0.3 ml of saline per dose , also administered in the deltoid,21 days apart . all study participants were observed for 30 min after receiving each dose . moderna yes , the moderna rct addressed a critical and timely issueof sars_cov_2_infection , a worldwide pandemic with dev_astating mortality and morbidity and an extremely high levelof contagiousness . this rct studied a population of adultsstratiﬁed on the basis of age and covid_19 complications risk criteria with groups of people aged_≥65_years , aged < 65 years who were at risk for severe covid_19 , and < 65 years without risk . participants were categorized as beingat risk for severe covid_19 if they had at least one of thefollowing on the basis of the centers for disease controland prevention criteria at the time of trial design : chroniclung disease , cardiac disease , severe obesity , diabetes , liverdisease , or hiv infection . the intervention was the mrna_1273 vaccine or the saline placebo control . the vaccine was provided as a sterile liquid at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml in a volume of 0.5 ml containing 100 mg of mrna_1273 , and the placebo control was 0.5 ml of saline . either wasadministered by intramuscular injection into the deltoidmuscle in a two_dose regimen given 28 days apart in thesame arm . safety outcomes included adverse_events andcases of covid_19 and severe covid_19 . moderna speci_ﬁed efﬁcacy outcomes as primary and secondary endpoints , with the primary endpoint being ef_ﬁcacy of the vaccine in preventing symptomatic infection at least 14 days after thesecond injection of vaccine . the secondary endpoints wereefﬁcacy in preventing infection with severe symptoms , the efﬁcacy of a single dose , having any symptoms of infection , and having a positive test . thus , ef_ﬁcacy included not only preventing infection but also preventing symptomatic orsevere infections . question two : was the assignment of patients to treatments/interventionsrandomized ? pﬁzer yes , all study participants , who were screened to meet studyeligibility criteria , completed information in an interactiveweb_based system used to randomly assign study partici_ pants , aged_≥ 16 years , in a 1:1 ratio , to the placebo_con_ trolled or vaccine ( bnt162b ) intervention groups . moderna yes , the participants were randomized in a one_to_one ratioto receive vaccine or placebo control , using a centralizedinteractive response technology system that was blinded tostudy staff and those receiving the vaccine . question three : were all the patients who entered the trial properlyaccounted for at its conclusion ? pﬁzer no , all study participants in the vaccine intervention groupor the placebo control group were accounted for in adetailed ﬂow diagram and in the narrative that detailed the characteristics of study participants . however , unique to the pﬁzer rct was that the study was multinational , with 152 participating sites worldwide . the demographic characteris_tics of the participant table ( table 1 in the article ) reporteddata for participants from argentina , brazil , south africa , and the united_states . however , the ve table ( table 3 inthe article ) only reported data from argentina , brazil , andthe united_states . therefore , it is not clear if participants from south africa were accounted for in the study . in addi_ tion , 196 patients with a diagnosis of hiv positive partici_pated in the study , but their data were to be analyzedseparately and was not included in this article . moderna yes , all participants who were either intervention with vac_cine or control with placebo control are detailed in a ﬂow www.jpedhc.org july/august 2021 445 diagram as directed by the consort guidelines and detailed in the narrative of the article . the participants were analyzed in the groups on which they were analyzed and insubgroups of age , age and health risk , sex , race and ethnicity , and risk for severe covid_19 illness . the rct was notstopped early . question four : were patients , health workers , and study personnel blind to treatment/intervention ? pﬁzer yes , patients , health workers , and study personnel wereblinded to study participant placebo control and vaccineintervention group assignments . in addition , site staff whowere responsible for safety evaluations by observing partici_pants for 30 min postvaccination did not have any knowl_edge about group assignments . moderna no , study staff and those receiving the vaccine were blind totreatment/intervention and placebo control ; however , vac_cine doses were prepared and administered by pharmacistsand vaccine administrators who were aware of treatment/intervention and placebo control assignments . these phar_macists and vaccine administrators had no other role in the rct . question five : were the groups similar at the start of the trial ? pﬁzer yes , the demographic characteristics of sex , race or ethnicgroups , country , age entering the study , age at vaccination , and body_mass_index , and coexisting conditions were similar for the vaccine intervention and placebo_controlled groups at the start of the trial . moderna yes , the groups of analysis in the intervention and control ofthe rct were similar . in addition , the selection of study sitesand enrollment were adjusted to increase the number of per_sons from racial and ethnic groups in the rct , resulting in a population described as generally representative of demo_ graphics in the united_states . question six : aside from the experimental intervention , were thegroups treated equally ? pﬁzer there are two answers to this question . yes , on the days of their injection , all participants were monitored for 30 min after receiving the injection . participants in both the vaccineintervention and the placebo_controlled groups wereprompted by an electronic diary to record speci_ﬁc local or systemic adverse_events and use of antipyretics or pain med_ication within 7 days after receipt of each dose per theirassigned groups . all participants could also record in theelectronic diary without prompting any adverse eventthrough 1_month after the second dose and unsolicited seri_ ous adverse_events through 6 months after the second dose . in addition , we can not tell , as no information was providedregarding instructions to participants ; for example , were allparticipants instructed to wear masks , keep social_distance , and wash hands frequently ? what was the protocol for test_ing all participants for covid_19 infection before and afterreceiving the vaccine ? for those who were positive afterreceiving the vaccine , was contact tracing completed ? moderna yes , participants were monitored for solicited local and sys_temic adverse_events ( 7 days after each injection ) , unsolicitedadverse reactions ( 28 days after each injection ) , adverse_events leading to discontinuation from a dose and/or rct , serious_adverse_events ( 1 −759 days and cases of covid_19 and severe covid_19 continuously from randomizationonward ) , regardless of intervention or placebo control . aspreviously noted , injections of 0.5 ml were given 28 daysapart in the same arm . question seven : how large was the treatment/intervention effect ? pﬁzer based on the evidence from the rct , the p ﬁzer vaccine was 52 % effective in the interval between the ﬁrst and second dose and 91 % effective in the ﬁrst 7 days after dose 2 . full efﬁcacy of 95 % protection against covid_19 in persons aged≥16 years after dose 2 for those in the vaccine inter_ vention group ( credible interval , 90.3 −97.6 ) . moderna based on evidence from the rct , the moderna vaccine was94.1 % effective at preventing laboratory_con ﬁrmed symp_ tomatic covid_19 illness . for the primary endpoint , 196 cases of covid_19 were diagnosed with 11 cases in thevaccine intervention group ( 3.3 per 1,000 person_years ; 95 % conﬁdence interval [ ci ] , 1.7 −6.0 ) and 185 cases in the pla_ cebo control group ( 56.5 per 1,000 person_years ; 95 % ci,48.7−65.3 ) . for the secondary endpoint , 30 participants in the rct had severe covid_19 , and all 30 were in the pla_cebo control group , indicating a ve of 100 % ( 95 % ci , could not be estimated to 1.0 ) . question eight : how precise was the estimate of the treatment/interventioneffect ? pﬁzer the researchers reported eight cases of covid_19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose among the vaccineintervention group ( bnt162b2b ) and 162 cases amongthose randomly assigned to the placebo_controlled group.ten cases of severe covid_19 were reported after the ﬁrst_dose was administered to both the vaccine intervention andthe placebo_controlled group : one case occurred in the inter_vention group and nine cases in the placebo control group . 446 volume 35 /c15number 4 journal of pediatric health care/c210 moderna in addition to the effects of the intervention noted above , participants assessed 14 days after the ﬁrst_dose of vaccine for the presence of sars_cov_2_infection , noting 225 caseswith placebo control and 11 cases with the vaccine , indicat_ing a ve of 95.2 % ( 95 % ci , 91.2 −97.4 ) . participants who were sars_cov_2 seropositive at baseline were alsoincluded per_protocol in the analysis ( 187 cases with placebocontrol , 12 cases with cases ; one participant assigned to receive vaccine was inadvertently given placebo control , indi_ cating a ve of 93.6 % [ 95 % ci , 88.6 −96.5 ] ) . these data conclude a precise treatment effect among varying analysesof the rct . question nine : can the results be applied to the local population or inyour context ? pﬁzer yes , study participants were similar to those who would receive the vaccine in the united_states and to those studysites in argentina and brazil as ef_ﬁcacy data are reported for those countries . moderna yes , the participants in the trial were similar enough to thosewho would be administered the vaccine , and the results canbe applied to a variety of populations , on the basis of age , healthy or with a health risk or chronic condition , race and ethnicity , and sex . question 10 : were all clinically important outcomes considered ? pﬁzer no , it was not possible to consider all clinically importantoutcomes given the “ warp speed ” conduction of the rct , which was essential as the world is living in a pandemic . theresearchers are planning to continue follow_up of study par_ ticipants for the next 2 years . at this time , there is a severe shortage of available vaccines , and there is consideration ofadministering the single dose , which showed a 52 % ef_ﬁcacy rate 7 days after the initial dose . moderna no , all clinically important outcomes were not considered asthis rct was of short duration because of the currentcovid_19 pandemic . other outcomes to consider are ef ﬁ_ cacy of single dose of vaccine , reduced or half doses of vac__cine , the extended interval between two_dose regimen ( e.g. , > 28 days between doses ) , and long_term_ef ﬁcacy of the vaccine and whether booster doses will be needed in thefuture . however , these outcomes do not affect the decisionto proceed with the use of the vaccine to prevent morbidityand mortality in the population at this time , focusing on riskfor severe covid_19 such as age and health risk.question 11 : are the benefits worth the harms and costs ? pﬁzer yes , the bene ﬁts of the vaccine are worth the cost of produc_ tion and administration . the 95 % ef_ﬁcacy rate achieved after dose 2 has the potential to signi_ﬁcantly impact the mor_ bidity and mortality resulting from acquiring sars_cov_2infection . moderna yes , on the basis of the results of the phase 3 rct , the bene_ﬁts of the moderna vaccine far outweigh the costs . the vac__cine demonstrated 94 % ef_ﬁcacy for the prevention of symptomatic sars_cov_2_infection compared with placebocontrol , measured starting 14 days after the second dose , and 100 % ef_ﬁcacy in prevention of severe covid_19 . safety was demonstrated in the relatively mild , short dura_ tion , and frequency of local and systemic adverse_events , which were similar to placebo control . the most commonlocal event was pain after injection , which occurred muchmore commonly in the vaccine intervention group , and themost common systemic events were fatigue and headache , which were similar to the placebo control . reporting of the rcts as part of the appraisal process , the rcts for both p ﬁzer and moderna articles were evaluated using the consort2010 checklist of information to include when reporting anrct . both rcts failed to include identi ﬁcation as an rct in the title . both articles were evaluated as including all otherkey information for reporting an rct ; however , we felt itwas important to note that both included supplementarymaterials on the journal web site . summary of critical appraisal we conducted a rigorous analysis of the two rcts using thecasp checklist ( critical appraisal skills programme , 2018 ) , and we found that both p ﬁzer and moderna vaccines dem_ onstrated safety and ef_ﬁcacy . most checklist items were posi_ tive or yes for both p ﬁzer and moderna rcts . for the p ﬁzer vaccine , all the patients who entered the trial were not properly accounted for at its conclusion ( question three ) . for the moderna vaccine , study personnel of pharmacistsand vaccine administrators were not blind to treatment/intervention ( question four ) . all clinically important out_comes were not considered for both vaccines ( question 10 ) ; however , this was attributed to the need for a vaccine in apandemic with signi_ﬁcant morbidity and mortality . in addi_ tion , we conducted an analysis of the reporting of these rcts using the consort checklist ( consolidated stand_ ards of reporting trials , 2010 ) and found that both p ﬁzer and moderna vaccine rct articles included the necessarydetails for reporting an rct with the exception of notincluding rct in the title . using the casp checklist , we noted that the checklist does not account for vaccine_speci ﬁc rct concerns such as side_effects of the vaccine . we found the side_effects for www.jpedhc.org july/august 2021 447 both vaccines to be mostly minor and local or speci ﬁct o vaccine administration sites . in a critical appraisal of a vac__cine or other types of rct , it may be helpful to focus onquestions speci_ﬁc to the rct . of note is the dosing for moderna at 100 mg per dose of mrna_123 compared with p ﬁzer ’ s dosing of 30 mg . thus , the moderna vaccine is providing three times the amountper dose as p ﬁzer with no difference in outcomes . as more is learned about these vaccines as the initial clinical_trials are further studied , long_term safety and ef_ﬁcacy both in the laboratory and from continued analysis of outcomes forindividuals who participated in the clinical_trials , dosage rec_ommendations will be further analyzed . data continues tobe collected and analyzed for the phase 2/3 clinical trialphase to determine vaccine immunogenicity and durabilityof the immune response . in addition , all individuals whohave taken the vaccine in the united_states should complete the centers_for_disease_control and prevention ( http : // www.cdc.gov ) postvaccination monitoring system , vaccine adverse_event reporting system , to assure a continuedknowledge base for covid_19 and vaccine safety , ef_ﬁcacy , and immunogenicity responses . conclusions and implications for practice nurse practitioner educational programs introduce casp tools in the research and evidence_based practice coursesand have students continue to use the tools throughout clini_cal courses to enable students to conduct a critical analysis ofpublished research studies with the goal of determiningwhether the study outcomes can be applied to their patientpopulations . all practicing clinicians should continue thisanalysis as new studies emerge , and new treatment modali_ ties become available for implementation into clinical prac_ tice . thus , the authors conducted the analysis of the rctspublished by both p ﬁzer and moderna after receiving emer_ gency use authorization for distribution and administrationof vaccines by the fda . the authors believed that the analy_sis was an essential component of the distribution process todevelop plans and communication strategies to reducepotential vaccine hesitancy and resistance . the analysis out_ comes revealed that both rcts were rigorously conducted and provide an assurance to all health care providers and thepublic of the safety and ef_ﬁcacy of both vaccines to impact the astounding morbidity and mortality of covid_19 dis_ease . when asked by patients , “ do you recommend the pﬁzer and moderna vaccines ? ” nurse practitioners ( nps ) should review their patients ’ health status , and if the patientmeets the study population , they can con ﬁdently say , yes , take the vaccine when available to you . pﬁzer and

nejm.org december 31 , 2020 2604the new england journal of medicine coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid_19 ) has affected tens of millions of people globally1 since it was declared a pandemic by the world_health_organization on march 11 , 2020.2 older_adults , persons with certain coex _ isting conditions , and front_line workers are at highest risk for covid_19 and its complications . recent data show increasing rates of severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars_cov_2 ) infection and covid_19 in other populations , in _ cluding younger adults.3 safe and effective pro _ phylactic vaccines are urgently needed to contain the pandemic , which has had devastating medi _ cal , economic , and social consequences . we previously reported phase 1 safety and im _ munogenicity results from clinical_trials of the vaccine candidate bnt162b2,4 a lipid nanoparticle– formulated,5 nucleoside_modified rna ( modrna ) 6 encoding the sars_cov_2 full_length spike , modi _ fied by two proline mutations to lock it in the prefusion conformation.7 findings from studies conducted in the united_states and germany among healthy men and women showed that two 30_μg doses of bnt162b2 elicited high sars_cov_2 neutralizing_antibody titers and robust antigen_ specific cd8+ and th1_type cd4+ t_cell respons _ es.8 the 50 % neutralizing geometric mean titers elicited by 30 μg of bnt162b2 in older and young _ er adults exceeded the geometric mean titer mea _ sured in a human convalescent serum panel , de _ spite a lower neutralizing response in older_adults than in younger adults . in addition , the reactoge _ nicity profile of bnt162b2 represented mainly short_term local ( i.e. , injection_site ) and systemic responses . these findings supported progression of the bnt162b2 vaccine candidate into phase 3 . here , we report safety and efficacy findings from the phase 2/3 part of a global phase 1/2/3 trial evaluating the safety , immunogenicity , and efficacy of 30 μg of bnt162b2 in preventing covid_19 in persons 16 years_of_age or older . this data set and these trial results are the basis for an application for emergency_use_authorization.9 col_ lection of phase 2/3 data on vaccine immunoge _ nicity and the durability of the immune response to immunization is ongoing , and those data are not reported here . methods trial objectives , participants and oversight we assessed the safety and efficacy of two 30_μg doses of bnt162b2 , administered intramuscu _larly 21 days apart , as compared with placebo . adults 16 years_of_age or older who were healthy or had stable chronic medical conditions , includ _ ing but not limited to human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) , hepatitis b virus , or hepatitis c vi _ rus infection , were eligible for participation in the trial . key exclusion criteria included a medi _ cal history of covid_19 , treatment with immuno _ suppressive therapy , or diagnosis with an im _ munocompromising condition . pfizer was responsible for the design and conduct of the trial , data collection , data analysis , data interpretation , and the writing of the manuscript . biontech was the sponsor of the trial , manufactured the bnt162b2 clinical_trial material , and contributed to the interpretation of the data and the writing of the manuscript . all the trial data were available to all the authors , who vouch for its accuracy and completeness and for adherence of the trial to the protocol , which is available with the full text of this article at nejm.org . an independent data and safety mon _ itoring board reviewed efficacy and unblinded safety data . trial procedures with the use of an interactive web_based sys _ tem , participants in the trial were randomly as _ signed in a 1:1 ratio to

site staff who were responsible for safety evaluation and were un _ aware of group assignments observed partici__ pants for 30 minutes after vaccination for any acute reactions . safety the primary end points of this trial were solic _ ited , specific local or systemic adverse_events and use of antipyretic or pain medication within 7 days after the receipt of each dose of vaccine or placebo , as prompted by and recorded in an electronic diary in a subset of participants ( the reactogenicity subset ) , and unsolicited adverse_events ( those reported by the participants with _ out prompts from the electronic diary ) through 1 month after the second dose and unsolicited serious_adverse_events through 6 months after the second dose . adverse_event data through ap _ proximately 14 weeks after the second dose are included in this report . in this report , safety a quick take is available at nejm.org the new england journal of medicine downloaded_from_nejm.org on july 2 , 2024 . for personal

infected with hiv ( 196 pa _ tients ) will be analyzed separately and are not included here . during the phase 2/3 portion of the study , a stopping rule for the theoretical concern of vac_ cine_enhanced disease was to be triggered if the one_sided probability of observing the same or a more unfavorable adverse severe case split ( a split with a greater proportion of severe cases in vac _ cine recipients ) was 5 % or less , given the same true incidence for vaccine and placebo recipients . alert criteria were to be triggered if this probabil _ ity was less than 11 % . efficacy the first primary end_point was the efficacy of bnt162b2 against confirmed covid_19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose in participants who had been without serologic or virologic evi _ dence of sars_cov_2_infection up to 7 days after the second dose ; the second primary end_point was efficacy in participants with and partici__ pants without evidence of prior infection . con _ firmed covid_19 was defined according to the food and drug administration ( fda ) criteria as the presence of at least one of the following symptoms : fever , new or increased cough , new or increased shortness of breath , chills , new or in _ creased muscle pain , new loss of taste or smell , sore_throat , diarrhea , or vomiting , combined with a respiratory specimen obtained during the symp _ tomatic period or within 4 days before or after it that was positive for sars_cov_2 by nucleic_acid amplification–based testing , either at the central laboratory or at a local testing facility ( using a protocol_defined acceptable test ) . major secondary end points included the ef _ ficacy of bnt162b2 against severe covid_19 . se _ vere covid_19 is defined by the fda as confirmed covid_19 with one of the following additional features : clinical signs at rest that are indicative of severe systemic illness ; respiratory_failure ; evi _ dence of shock ; significant acute renal , hepatic , or neurologic dysfunction ; admission to an in _ tensive care unit ; or death . details are provided in the protocol . an explanation of the various denominator values for use in assessing the results of the trial is provided in table s1 in the supplemen _ tary appendix , available at nejm.org . in brief , the safety population includes persons 16 years_of_age or older ; a total of 43,448 participants constituted the population of enrolled persons injected with the vaccine or placebo . the main safety subset as defined by the fda , with a me _ dian of 2 months of follow_up as of october 9 , 2020 , consisted of 37,706 persons , and the reac _ togenicity subset consisted of 8183 persons . the modified intention_to_treat ( mitt ) efficacy pop _ ulation includes all age_groups 12 years_of_age or older ( 43,355 persons ; 100 participants who were 12 to 15 years_of_age contributed to person_ time years but included no cases ) . the number of persons who could be evaluated for efficacy 7 days after the second dose and who had no evidence of prior infection was 36,523 , and the number of persons who could be evaluated 7 days after the second dose with or without evidence of prior infection was 40,137 . statistical_analysis the safety analyses included all participants who received at least one dose of bnt162b2 or placebo . the findings are descriptive in nature and not based on formal statistical_hypothesis_testing . safety analyses are presented as counts , percentages , and associated clopper–pearson 95 % confidence_intervals for local reactions , systemic events , and any adverse_events after vaccination , according to terms in the medical dictionary for regulatory activities ( meddra ) , ver _ sion 23.1 , for each vaccine group . analysis of the first primary efficacy end_point included participants who received the vac _ cine or placebo as randomly assigned , had no evidence of infection within 7 days after the second dose , and had no major protocol devia _ tions ( the population that could be evaluated ) . vaccine efficacy was estimated by 100 × ( 1 − irr ) , where irr is the calculated ratio of confirmed cases of covid_19 illness per 1000 person_years of follow_up in the active vaccine group to the corresponding illness rate in the placebo group . the 95.0 % credible interval for vaccine efficacy and the probability of vaccine efficacy greater than 30 % were calculated with the use of a bayesian beta_binomial model . the final analy _ sis uses a success boundary of 98.6 % for prob _ ability of vaccine efficacy greater than 30 % to compensate for the interim_analysis and to control the overall type 1 error rate at 2.5 % . moreover , primary and secondary efficacy end points are evaluated sequentially to control the the

the reactogenicity subset included 8183 partici__ pants . overall , bnt162b2 recipients reported more local reactions than placebo recipients . among bnt162b2 recipients , mild_to_moderate pain at the injection_site within 7 days after an injection was the most commonly reported local reaction , with less than 1 % of participants across all age_groups reporting severe pain ( fig . 2 ) . pain was reported less frequently among participants old _ er than 55 years_of_age ( 71 % reported pain after the first dose ; 66 % after the second dose ) than among younger participants ( 83 % after the first dose ; 78 % after the second dose ) . a noticeably lower percentage of participants reported injec _ tion_site redness or swelling . the proportion of participants reporting local reactions did not increase after the second dose ( fig . 2a ) , and no participant reported a grade 4 local reaction . in general , local reactions were mostly mild_to_mod _ erate in severity and resolved within 1 to 2 days . systemic reactogenicity systemic events were reported more often by younger vaccine recipients ( 16 to 55 years_of_age ) than by older vaccine recipients ( more than 55 years_of_age ) in the reactogenicity subset and more often after dose 2 than dose 1 ( fig . 2b ) . the most commonly reported systemic events were fatigue and headache ( 59 % and 52 % , re _ spectively , after the second dose , among younger vaccine recipients ; 51 % and 39 % among older recipients ) , although fatigue and headache were also reported by many placebo recipients ( 23 % and 24 % , respectively , after the second dose , among younger vaccine recipients ; 17 % and 14 % among older recipients ) . the frequency of any severe systemic event after the first dose was 0.9 % or less . severe systemic events were reported in less than 2 % of vaccine recipients after either dose , except for fatigue ( in 3.8 % ) and headache ( in 2.0 % ) after the second dose . fever ( temperature , ≥38°c ) was reported after the second dose by 16 % of younger vaccine re _ cipients and by 11 % of older recipients . only 0.2 % of vaccine recipients and 0.1 % of placebo recipi _ ents reported fever ( temperature , 38.9 to 40°c ) af _ ter the first dose , as compared with 0.8 % and 0.1 % , respectively , after the second dose . two participants each in the vaccine and placebo groups reported temperatures above 40.0°c . younger vaccine recipients were more likely to use antipyretic or pain medication ( 28 % after dose 1 ; 45 % after dose 2 ) than older vaccine re _ cipients ( 20 % after dose 1 ; 38 % after dose 2 ) , and placebo recipients were less likely ( 10 to 14 % ) than vaccine recipients to use the medications , figure 1 ( facing page ) . enrollment and randomization . the

95 % ci , 68.7 to 99.9 ; case split : bnt162b2 , 2 cases ; placebo , 44 cases ) . figure 3 shows cases of covid_19 or severe covid_19 with onset at any time after the first dose ( mitt popu _ lation ) ( additional data on severe covid_19 are available in table s5 ) . between the first dose and the second dose , 39 cases in the bnt162b2 group and 82 cases in the placebo group were observed , resulting in a vaccine efficacy of 52 % ( 95 % ci , 29.5 to 68.4 ) during this interval and indicating early protection by the vaccine , starting as soon as 12 days after the first dose . discussion a two_dose regimen of bnt162b2 ( 30 μg per dose , given 21 days apart ) was found to be safe and 95 % effective against covid_19 . the vaccine met both primary efficacy end points , with more than a 99.99 % probability of a true vaccine ef _ ficacy greater than 30 % . these results met our prespecified success criteria , which were to es _ tablish a probability above 98.6 % of true vaccine efficacy being greater than 30 % , and greatly exceeded the minimum fda criteria for authori _ zation.9 although the study was not powered to definitively assess efficacy by subgroup , the point estimates of efficacy for subgroups based on age , sex , race , ethnicity , body_mass index , or the presence of an underlying condition associ _ ated with a high risk of covid_19 complications are also high . for all analyzed subgroups in which more than 10 cases of covid_19 occurred , the lower limit of the 95 % confidence_interval for efficacy was more than 30 % . the cumulative_incidence of covid_19 cases over time among placebo and vaccine recipients begins to diverge by 12 days after the first dose , 7 days after the estimated median viral incuba _ tion period of 5 days,10 indicating the early onset of a partially protective effect of immunization . the study was not designed to assess the efficacy of a single_dose regimen . nevertheless , in the interval between the first and second doses , the observed vaccine efficacy against covid_19 was 52 % , and in the first 7 days after dose 2 , it was 91 % , reaching full efficacy against disease with onset at least 7 days after dose 2 . of the 10 cases of severe covid_19 that were observed after the first dose , only 1 occurred in the vaccine group . this finding is consistent with overall high ef _ ficacy against all covid_19 cases . the severe case split provides preliminary evidence of vaccine_ mediated protection against severe_disease , al _ leviating many of the theoretical concerns over vaccine_mediated disease enhancement.11 the favorable safety profile observed during phase 1 testing of bnt162b24,8 was confirmed in the phase 2/3 portion of the trial . as in phase 1 , reactogenicity was generally mild or moderate , and reactions were less common and milder in older_adults than in younger adults . systemic reactogenicity was more common and severe after the second dose than after the first dose , although local reactogenicity was similar after the two doses . severe fatigue was observed in approximately 4 % of bnt162b2 recipients , which is higher than that observed in recipients of some vaccines recommended for older_adults.12 this rate of severe fatigue is also lower than that the new england journal of medicine downloaded_from_nejm.org on july 2 , 2024 . for personal use only . no other uses without permission . copyright © 2020 massachusetts medical society . all rights reserved . n engl j med 383 ;

correspondence : tom shimabukuro email : tshimabukuro @ cdc.gov january 29 , 2021/70 ( 4 ) ; 125– 129 . as of january 20 , 2021 , a total of 24 135 690 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid_ 19 ) and 400 306 associated deaths had been reported in the united_states ( https : //covid.cdc.gov/covid _ data_ track er/ # cases_cases per10 0klas t7days ) . on december 18 , 2020 , the food and drug administration ( fda ) issued an emergency_use_authorization ( eua ) for moderna covid_ 19 vaccine administered as 2 doses , 1 month apart to prevent covid_ 19 . on december 19 , 2020 , the advisory_committee_on_immunization_practices ( acip ) issued an interim recommendation for use of moderna covid_ 19 vaccine.1 as of january 10 , 2021 , a reported 4 041 396 first doses of moderna covid_ 19 vaccine had been administered in the united_states , and reports of 1266 ( 0.03 % ) adverse_events after receipt of moderna covid_ 19 vaccine were submitted to the vaccine adverse_event reporting system ( vaers ) . among these , 108 case_reports were identified for further review as possible cases of severe aller _ gic reaction , including anaphylaxis . anaphylaxis is a life_ threatening allergic_reaction that occurs rarely after vaccination , with onset typ _ ically within minutes to hours.2 among these case_reports , 10 cases were determined to be anaphylaxis ( a rate of 2.5 anaphylaxis cases per million moderna covid_ 19 vaccine doses administered ) , includ _ ing nine in persons with a documented history of allergies or allergic_reactions , five of whom had a previous history of anaphylaxis . the median interval from vaccine receipt to symptom onset was 7.5 min ( range = 1– 45 min ) . among eight persons with follow_ up information available , all had recovered or been discharged home . among the re _ maining case_reports that were determined not to be anaphylaxis , 47 were assessed to be nonanaphylaxis_allergic reactions , and 47 were considered nonallergic adverse_events . for four case_reports , inves _ tigators have been unable to obtain sufficient information to assess the likelihood of anaphylaxis . this report summarizes the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of case_reports of allergic_reactions , in _ cluding anaphylaxis and nonanaphylaxis_allergic reactions , after receipt of the first dose of moderna covid_ 19 vaccine during december 21 , 2020– january 10 , 2021 , in the united_states . cdc has issued updated interim clinical considerations for use of mrna covid_ 19 vaccines currently authorized in the united_states 3 and interim considerations for preparing for the potential management of anaphylaxis.4 using methods previously described,5 cdc and fda identified reports of suspected anaphylaxis in vaers , the national passive surveillance ( i.e. , spontaneous reporting ) system for monitoring ad _ verse events after immunization.6 cdc physicians screened vaers reports describing suspected severe allergic_reactions and anaphy _ laxis and applied brighton collaboration case definition criteria for anaphylaxis * .7 after initial screening , reports with sufficient evi _ dence to suggest anaphylaxis were followed up by collecting infor _ mation from medical records and through direct outreach to health care facilities and treating health care providers , and , in some cases , vaccine recipients . physician reviewers classified all initially identi _ fied case_reports as anaphylaxis or not anaphylaxis and used clin _ ical judgment to further categorize reports that were considered not anaphylaxis as nonanaphylaxis_allergic reactions or nonallergic adverse_events . nonallergic adverse_events , mostly vasovagal ( e.g. , fainting or the sensation of fainting ) or suspected anxiety_ related , were excluded from the final analyses . anaphylaxis and nonanaphy _ laxis allergic_reaction cases with symptom onset occurring later than the day after vaccination ( i.e. , outside the 0– 1_ day risk window ) were also excluded because of the difficulty in clearly attributing allergic_reactions with onset later than this to vaccination . † during december 21 , 2020– january 10 , 2021 , the administration of 4 041 396 first doses of moderna covid_ 19 vaccine ( 2 465 411 © 2021 the american society of transplantation and the american society of transplant surgeons | 1327 shimabukuro to females [ 61 % ] , 1 450 966 to males [ 36 % ] , and 125 019 to persons whose sex was not recorded [ 3 % ] ) was reported to cdc . during the same period , reports of 1266 ( 0.03 % ) adverse_events after receipt of the first dose of moderna covid_ 19 vaccine had been submitted to vaers . among these , 108 case_reports were identified for further review as possible cases of severe allergic_reaction , including anaphy _ laxis , based on descriptions of signs and symptoms ; 10 of these re _ ports , all describing events in females , met the brighton collaboration case definition criteria for anaphylaxis ( table 1 ) , corresponding to an initial estimated rate of 2.5 anaphylaxis cases per million first moderna covid_ 19 vaccine doses administered . the median_age of persons with anaphylaxis was 47 years ( range = 31– 63 years ) . the median interval from vaccine receipt to symptom onset was 7.5 min ( range = 1– 45 min ) ; nine patients had onset within 15 min , and one had onset after 30 min ( figure 1 ) . in all 10 reports , patients received epinephrine as part of initial emergency treatment ; the route of ad _ ministration was confirmed or presumed to be intramuscular based on the description of treatment and the clinical course of the event as documented in the vaers report . six patients were hospitalized ( including five in intensive care , four of whom required endotracheal intubation ) , and four were treated in an emergency_department ; eight patients with follow_ up information available are known to have been discharged home or had recovered at the time of report to vaers . no deaths from anaphylaxis were reported after receipt of moderna covid_ 19 vaccine . nine of the 10 anaphylaxis case_reports included a patient history of allergies or allergic_reactions , including to drugs ( six ) , contrast media ( two ) , and foods ( one ) ; five patients had experi _ enced an episode of anaphylaxis in the past , none of which was asso _ ciated with receipt of a vaccine ( table 2 ) . no geographic clustering of anaphylaxis cases was observed , and the cases occurred after receipt of doses from multiple vaccine lots . at the time of this publication , despite follow_ up efforts , investigators have been unable to obtain sufficient information to assess the likelihood of anaphylaxis in four of the initial 108 suspected cases reported . among the 43 cases of nonanaphylaxis_allergic reaction after receipt of moderna covid_ 19 vaccination with symptom onset within the 0– 1_ day risk window , 26 ( 60 % ) were classified as nonserious . 3 commonly re _ ported symptoms included pruritus , rash , itchy sensations in the mouth and throat , sensations of throat closure , and respiratory symptoms . the median patient age was 43 years ( range = 22– 96 years ) , and 39 ( 91 % ) of the reported reactions occurred in women . the median interval from vaccine receipt to symptom onset was 15 min ( range = < 1 min– 24 h ) ; in 30 ( 73 % ) cases , onset occurred within 30 min , in 11 cases , onset oc _ curred after 30 min , and for two cases , time of onset was missing . for 26 ( 60 % ) case_reports , a past history of allergies or allergic_reactions , mostly to foods and drugs , was documented ( figure 1 ) . 1 | discussion early safety monitoring of moderna covid_ 19 vaccine detected 10 cases of anaphylaxis after reported administration of 4041396 first doses of moderna covid_ 19 vaccine ( 2.5 cases per million moderna covid_ 19 vaccine doses administered ) as well as cases of less severe nonanaphylaxis_allergic reactions , based on u.s. data for december 21 , 2020– january 10 , 2021 . anaphylaxis is potentially life_ threatening and requires immediate treatment.4 based on this early monitoring , anaphylaxis after receipt of moderna covid_ 19 vaccine appears to be a rare event ; however , comparisons of ana _ phylaxis risk with that associated with non– covid_ 19 vaccines are constrained at this time by the limited data available this early in the covid_ 19 vaccination program . a previous analysis of the pfizer_ biontech covid_ 19 vaccine , also an mrna vaccine , estimated an initial rate of 11.1 cases per million_doses administered after receipt of the first dose of the pfizer_ biontech vaccine.5 cdc and fda will continue enhanced monitoring for anaphylaxis among recipients of covid_ 19 vaccines and will review case_reports to vaers . in nine of 10 cases of anaphylaxis after receipt of moderna covid_ 19 vaccine , patients had symptom onset within 30 min of vaccination , and nine anaphylaxis patients also had a history of allergies or allergic_reactions , including some with previous ana _ phylaxis events ; up to 30 % of persons in the general population might have some type of allergy or history of allergic_reactions . ¶ all 10 anaphylaxis cases reported after receipt of moderna covid_ 19 vaccine occurred in women . whereas a previous review of ana _ phylaxis reports to vaers found that 80 % of cases reported in adults involved females,8 the current finding could be affected by the observation that more women than men had received a first dose of moderna covid_ 19 vaccine during the analytic period ( 61 % of doses administered versus 36 % , respectively ) . in a previ _ ous analysis of the pfizer_ biontech covid_ 19 vaccine , two thirds summary what is already known about this topic ? anaphylaxis is a severe , life_ threatening allergic_reaction that occurs rarely after vaccination . what is added by this report ? during december 21 , 2020– january 10 , 2021 , monitoring by the vaccine adverse_event reporting system detected 10 cases of anaphylaxis after administration of a reported 4 041 396 first doses of moderna covid_ 19 vaccine ( 2.5 cases per million_doses administered ) . in nine cases , onset occurred within 15 min of vaccination . no anaphylaxis_ related deaths were reported . what are the impl\ications for public health practice ? locations administering covid_ 19 vaccines should ad _ here to cdc guidance , including screening recipients for contraindications and precautions , having necessary sup _ plies and staff members available to manage anaphylaxis , implementing recommended postvaccination observation periods , and immediately treating suspected anaphylaxis with intramuscular epinephrine injection . 1328 | shimabukuro table 1 characteristics of reported cases of anaphylaxis ( n = 10 ) after receipt of the first dose of moderna covid_ 19 vaccine — vaccine adverse_events reporting

pfizer_ biontech covid_ 19 vaccine.5 for both vaccines , symptom onset after vaccination occurred quickly , usu _ ally within minutes . a strong female predominance of anaphylaxis case_reports exists for both vaccines . finally , many persons expe _ riencing anaphylaxis after receiving either vaccine had a history of allergies or allergic_reactions , with several having experienced an anaphylaxis episode in the past . similar patient characteristics in case_reports of nonanaphylaxis_allergic reactions were observed among the two vaccines.the findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations . first , analyses of passive surveillance data include reporting biases , both underreporting because of lack of awareness or compliance with reporting requirements and reporting guidance , as well as stimulated reporting related to increased awareness from media or other public information sources . second , incomplete informa _ tion in reports and potential data lags because of processing times might result in an undercount of cases , and lags in reporting for vac _ cine doses administered might underestimate denominator data . however , reporting efficiency to vaers for clinically severe ad _ verse events is believed to be high . 9 it is reasonable to expect that diagnosis and reporting of an acute and clinically severe condition figure 1 minutes from vaccine receipt

anaphylaxis cases occurring after covid_ 19 vaccination . mortality from covid_ 19 in populations at increased risk for severe illness is substantial,10 and treatment options are limited . widespread vaccination against covid_ 19 with highly effective vaccines represents a critical tool in efforts to control the pan _ demic and save lives . cdc and fda will continue to monitor for adverse_events , including anaphylaxis , after administration of covid_ 19 vaccines and will regularly assess the benefits and risks of vaccination in the context of the evolving epidemiology of the pandemic . continued monitoring in vaers and additional moni _ toring in population_ based surveillance systems , such as the cdc ’ s vaccine safety datalink ( https : //www.cdc.gov/vacci nesaf ety/ ensur ingsa fety/monit oring/ vsd/index.html ) , will help to further charac _ terize the risk for anaphylaxis after administration of covid_ 19 vaccines . cdc guidance on use of mrna covid_ 19 vaccines and manage _ ment of anaphylaxis is available . 3,4 persons with an immediate aller _ gic reaction to the first dose of an mrna covid_ 19 vaccine should not receive additional doses of either of the mrna covid_ 19 vac _ cines . in addition to screening for contraindications and precautions before administering covid_ 19 vaccines , vaccine locations should have the necessary supplies and trained staff members available to manage anaphylaxis , implement postvaccination observation peri _ ods , immediately treat persons experiencing anaphylaxis signs and symptoms with intramuscular injection of epinephrine , and trans _ port patients to facilities where they can receive advanced medical care . in addition , all patients should be instructed to seek immedi _ ate medical care if they develop signs or symptoms of an allergic_reaction after their observation period ends and they have left the vaccination location . health care providers can play an important role in vaccine safety monitoring by being vigilant in recognizing and reporting adverse_events after immunization to vaers at https : //vaers.hhs.gov/repor tevent.html.acknowledgmentsinvestigators from the clinical

( 2 ) protein_based vaccines : this consists of a protein puri ﬁed from either ( 1 ) virus or virus_infected cells , or ( 2 ) virus_likeparticles ( vlps ) , which are complex proteins that adopt a virus_like con ﬁrmation but do not contain a virus genome [ 10 ] . the vaccines made from these groups have been successful in controlling and eradicating many diseases worldwide [ 11 ] . covid_19 vaccines such as covaxin from bharat biotech , coronavirus_like particle covid_19 ( covlp ) from medicagoinc. , nvx_cov2373 from novavax , and covi_vac from coda_ genix/serum institute of india are examples of vaccines made using the traditional method with the inactivated virus [ 3 ] . table 1shows some of the traditional vaccine types , corresponding licensed vaccines , and corresponding covid_19 vaccines invarious phases of clinical development . 2.1 vaccine manufacturing : traditional method . this section describes the traditional way of vaccine development and manufacturing that has been in practice since the introduction of the concept of vaccines . the vaccines manufactured using these techniques are the traditional vaccines involving the injection ofsome form of the disease_causing pathogen either attenuated or inactivated [ 13 ] . vaccine development follows a phased procedure and can take a long time to assess safety and ef_ﬁcacy , clear all the regulatory approval procedures , and ﬁnally manufacture in a large scale for widespread vaccine supply and distribution . the complete process typically takes about 5 –10 years and is composed of two phases : product development phase and production phase [ 13 ] : ( 1 ) product development phase : the vaccine development process involves taking an antigen that is identi ﬁed to bethe best candidate from research and then transforming this into the ﬁnal product . in this process , the vaccine ingredients , processing materials , speci ﬁcations of the product , and man_ ufacturing process are determined and de ﬁned . the scale of manufacturing during this phase is signi_ﬁcantly less than what is used in the mass_production phase . vaccines for clin_ical trials are usually developed in this phase . ( 2 ) production phase : the production is composed of two stages . in the ﬁrst stage , the “ drug substance ” is created , and in the second stage , the “ drug product ” is created [ 14 ] . the drug product is the formulated active_ingredient that is administered to the patients . the product development and production phases are illustrated in fig . 1and discussed in some detail below . 2.1.1 stage 1 : production of drug substance . theﬁrst step in stage 1 production is called the cell culture . the aim of this step is to generate the antigen which is required to induce an immune response . in this step , a living host that can produce the antigen iscultivated . different hosts may be used depending on the type of antigen that will be expressed . in the case of traditional vaccines made from live or attenuated viruses , often the host is a chickenﬁbroblast and for recombinant protein antigens , the host may be bacterial , yeast , or mammalian cells [ 13 ] . these cell cultures are often referred to as “ master cell banks ” and are rigorously character_ ized , stored , and protected [ 13 ] . using this cell bank , working cell banks can be prepared for future production . it is important to notethat any changes in the cell bank used for production can result in changes in the ﬁnal product , so cell growth is rigorously controlled . the next step is to release or separate the antigen from the sub_ strate , and this is often called the harvesting process . once again , this is done in different ways depending on the type of the host.it could be separation of the free virus or isolation of proteins secreted in a cell or removal of the cell from the spent medium . once the antigen is harvested , it is sent for the puri ﬁcation of the antigen . in this step , all the impurities are removed . for vaccines table 1 selected traditional vaccine types and licensed vaccines ( as of dec. 1 , 2021 ) [ 3,11,12 ] traditional vaccine type licensed vaccines covid_19 vaccines

consist of column_chromatography and ultra ﬁltration [ 13 ] . in the case of inactivated viral vaccines , this step might just involve inactivating any live virus used to produce the vaccine or inactivating any con_ taminating viruses that came along with the host_cells . once the antigens or inactivated viruses are puri ﬁed , they are combined with all the individual components and ingredients that constitute the ﬁnal vaccine . this step is called the formulation . the ingredients added in this step might be the stabilizers to improve shelf_life , adjuvant to boost immune response , or preserva_ tives to protect vaccines from external interactions . these opera_tions are always carried out in a controlled environment [ 13 ] . 2.1.2 stage 2 : production of drug product . this stage mostly comprises the postproduction activities after the vaccine has under_ gone the formulation process . the vaccines after stage 1 are ﬁlled into a vial or a syringe . then , it is subjected to freeze_drying , where water is removed from the product by converting it to a powder form . this ensures better stability . the vials are then labeled according to the regulatory requirements and packed ; this is the packaging process . next , the quality_assurance checks and con ﬁrms that the vaccine has been manufactured and tested according to the standards . after the ﬁnal approval , the product is authorized for batch release and distribution . finally , the vaccines are transported in a temperature_controlled environment around the world . this completes the entire vaccine manufacturing process . 2.2 challenges with traditional methods . traditional vac__cines have some serious drawbacks . first , the vaccines involve a lengthy culturing process in addition to the considerable time lag between the antigen production and the last mile delivery of vac__cines . furthermore , owing to the contagious nature of the ingredi_ents , traditional vaccine manufacturing requires sophisticated containment facilities and intense safety precautions to minimize the risk to the operators and environment . another concerning factor is that despite the efforts to modify or weaken the virus to create vaccines , live attenuated viruses can revert to their virulentstrains [ 15 ] . the traditional vaccine manufacturing process also has several limitations due to the large number of steps involved in this process . none of the vaccine manufacturing processes are optimal , and hence , there is always a loss of material that reducesthe overall productivity . an additional challenge with vaccine man_ ufacturing is the necessity to comply with the who guidelines on safety and manufacture according to the current good manufactur_ing practices ( cgmp ) [ 13 ] . moreover , traditional vaccine manufacturing typically involves the collaboration of multiple organizations ( contract manufacturers ) which are individually responsible for a particular segment or process in vaccine manufacturing . hence , there are often inef ﬁcien_ cies with proper coordination among the parties especially with respect to compliance with the safety and quality guidelines and obtaining the required regulatory licenses . finally , traditional man_ ufacturing always has issues with adapting to the changing demand of vaccines and responding to the changes quickly and effectively.the production rate needs to be scaled up especially during pan_ demics and needs to be brought back when things subside . this often calls for production ﬂexibility which is not easily attainable in the traditional manufacturing setting . outbreaks of pandemics such as the covid_19 are timely signals that an improved vaccine manufacturing process is required to reduce vaccine development and production time . covid_19 vaccines based on novel biotechnology platforms such as the mrna and viral vector vaccines [ 16 ] are the ﬁrst step toward this goal . it is worthwhile to note that during the covid_19 pandemic , many biopharmaceutical industries have successfully transitioned to the novel platforms to develop vaccines on a much faster timeline without compromising on vaccine ef_ﬁcacy or safety.3 novel biotechnology platforms for vaccine manufacturing in an adverse outbreak of a pandemic like the covid_19 , the typical timeline of vaccine development , manufacturing , and distri_ bution needs to be accelerated to control the spread of the disease . biopharmaceutical ﬁrms responding to this need require signi_ﬁcant ﬁnancial resources and an expedited pathway for approval of the vaccine products by the food and drug administration ( fda ) . to support such ﬁrms , the us government initiated a public – private partnership under the operation warp speed ( ows ) . ows supports the mass production of vaccines and underwrites theﬁnancial commitment that allows companies to scale vaccine production without waiting for full phase 3 clinical_trial results . vaccine manufacturers have received billions of dollars in funding to support vaccine scale_up through this effort [ 17 ] . the traditional vaccine manufacturing techniques , however , can no longer meet the sudden spike in demand . this has motivated thebiopharmaceutical industries to shift to modern vaccine manufac_ turing methods using viral vector or nucleic acid_based ( i.e. , mrna ) vaccines . during the ongoing covid_19 pandemic , bio_pharmaceutical industries have successfully employed the novel vaccine platform technology to develop and manufacture vaccines on an accelerated timeline without compromising on vaccine safety , ef_ﬁcacy , and scienti ﬁc or ethical integrity . this has been demonstrated by ﬁrms using mrna vaccines based on the platform technology as observed from the following case studies . 3.1 mrna vaccines case study 1 : p ﬁzer/biontech covid_19 vaccine manufacturing . pﬁzer/biontech vaccine , developed by biontech in partnership with p ﬁzer , was the ﬁrst vaccine to be granted both emergency_use_authorization ( eua ) and full approval ( licensed ) by the us food and drug administra_ tion ( fda ) . it is an mrna vaccine composed of nucleoside_ modiﬁed mrna that encodes the spike_protein found in the sars_cov_2 and is encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles [ 18 ] . figure 2shows the work ﬂow of the mrna vaccine from p ﬁzer/ biontech . vaccines are being manufactured by p ﬁzer in their own facilities by employing a three_stage process . in the ﬁrst stage , the deoxyri_ bonucleic acid ( dna ) that codes the spike_protein of the fig . 2 work ﬂow of the mrna vaccine

conducted at a plant in chester ﬁeld , missouri [ 19 ] . the bacteria are harvested after 4 days of growth , and the desired dna is recovered through rigorous puri ﬁcation . the genetic material is then stored under freezing conditions and transported to a p ﬁzer plant in andover , massachusetts for the second stage [ 20 ] . in the second stage , the genetic information encoded in the dna is transcribed by enzymes to make messenger_rna ( mrna ) working copies . these mrna copies ultimately are the instructions to create the spike_protein antigens in vaccinated people . the mrna pieces are then puri ﬁed , frozen , and stored in bags [ 21 ] . the bags are then shipped to the next p ﬁzer plant in portage , mich_ igan for the ﬁnal stage of the manufacturing [ 22 ] . in this third and ﬁnal stage , the mrna pieces are combined with lipid nanoparticles [ 21 ] . pﬁzer has signed contracts with partner chemical ﬁrms for lipid nanoparticle supply [ 23 ] . once the mixture is made , it is then ﬁlled in vials , boxed , and frozen [ 21 ] . pﬁzer has developed temperature_controlled shippers for the safe transport of vaccines . the thermal shippers are designed to use dry_ice to maintain thecold temperature . the boxes are planned to be delivered by both air and ground transport to the site where they will be administered [ 22 ] . according to reports [ 21 ] , the major bottleneck in the entire manufacturing process is the step involving the mixing of mrna and lipid nanoparticles . this is attributed to the fact that thecompany was unable to wait until the procurement of large_scale machinery and was forced to use existing processes . also , the main issue with the transportation of this vaccine is that it needs to be maintained at extremely cold and freezing temperatures ( between −80 and −60 °c ) . this proves to be a great challenge in countries that lack extreme refrigeration facilities . 3.2 mrna vaccines case study 2 : moderna vaccine manufacturing . moderna vaccine is also an mrna vaccine that was given an eua by the fda soon after the p ﬁzer/biontech vaccine . moderna vaccines have similar ef_ﬁcacy as its counterpart and , more importantly , requires a storage temperature of just 2 – 8 °c for up to one month or −20_°c for longer periods , as opposed to the more extreme freezing temperature requirement ofpﬁzer/biontech vaccine . moderna follows similar manufacturing steps like its counterpart but has entered more extensive collaborations with contract manu_ facturing organizations ( cmo ) , when compared with p ﬁzer/bion_ tech , to scale up its vaccine production . moderna has involved thelonza group to manufacture additional vaccines in their facilities and is purchasing the lipid nanoparticle from corden pharma . it has contracted with catalent in the united_states for the task of ﬁlling and packaging [ 24 ] . the remarkable platform_based vaccine design and manufactur_ ing technique used by these ﬁrms have some similarities with the traditional product_design and manufacturing concepts and interest_ ing features applicable to a large class of products beyond tradi_tional biopharmaceutical products . to highlight the “ smart ” characteristics of these novel platform_based covid_19 vaccine products and to make an effective comparison with the traditional products , a well_established product classi ﬁcation framework is used as a reference . this is discussed below , in sec . 4 . 4 analysis of covid_19 vaccine products and manufacturing according to ulrich and eppinger [ 7 ] , products generally can be classi ﬁed into eight types based on the underlying generic product development process as shown in table 2 . on close examination , it can see observed that the novel vaccine products do not just fall under one of the classi ﬁcations shown in table 2 , but instead can combine many types of classi ﬁcations . therefore , the novel platform_based vaccines can be effectively classi ﬁed as : ( 1 ) platform products : this is the terminology used by who and in medical literature . for example , the p ﬁzer/biontech and moderna vaccines belong to the same platform because they share the same biotechnology for ( 1 ) making mrna strands and ( 2 ) encapsulating them in lipid nanoparticles . ( 2 ) process_intensive products : the production processes for these vaccines are extremely intricate and are highly con_ trolled and regulated by the fda . ( 3 ) technology push products : the biotechnology used for many of the vaccines is relatively new —they are based on recent advances in molecular_biology and genomics . ( 4 ) high_risk products : drug trials have a high risk of failure . ( 5 ) customized products : slight variations of the vaccines ( e.g. , mrna ) are being tried now to combat the emerging virusvariants . ( 6 ) quick_build products : rapid “ design_build_test ” of vaccines is being tried now to combat the emerging virus variants . ( 7 ) complex system products : the development and manufac_ turing of these vaccines involve close intervention betweenboth hardware and software components . any modi ﬁcation in the gene_sequencing software can induce changes in the vaccine development and manufacturing process . the detailed information on each of the above classi ﬁcations is discussed below under separate sub_sections . sections 4.1and4.2 contain a detailed analysis of the concepts of “ platform products ” and “ process_intensive product ” applied to the novel platform_ based vaccine products , respectively . the notion of technology push products is discussed along with platform products since ulrich and eppinger [ 7 ] consider these concepts to be very similar . vaccines as high_risk products are quite self_explanatory considering the liabilities associated with the use of such products.moreover , vaccines are becoming highly “ customized products ” and “ quick_built products ” , and these ideas are assessed in secs . 4.3and4.4 , respectively . finally , sec . 4.5describes how vac__cines fall into the category of complex system products . table 2 classi ﬁcation of products by ulrich and eppinger

. platform_based vaccine has emerged as the best option to tackle the covid_19 vaccine manufacturing challenges , which include speed , ef_ﬁcacy , and safety . in simple terms , a product platform is a “ group ” of distinct parts , components , or modules that is common to all the products derived out of the platform . for example , an automotive industrymight develop a car platform , where all the vehicles manufactured in this platform will have the same chassis , powertrain , drive train , battery , etc . these components , which are shared among the differ_ ent car models , de ﬁne the platform components and the platform components that constitute the platform . platform_based vaccines support modularity . for example , the vaccines can have a “ base carrier ” such as lipid nanoparticles or viral vectors . the components that are plugged into the basecarrier are called “ modules . ” the modules can be the mrna or dna strands , which are tailor_made based on the target disease and can be enveloped by the base carrier to generate the required vaccine [ 15 ] . once a platform has been licensed for a vaccine , the development of new vaccines in the future , using the same platform , will enable rapid development , regulatory approval , and large_scale manufacturing . there are mainly two kinds of platform_based vaccines that are being widely used to combat covid_19 : viral vector vaccines and mrna vaccines , which are explained in detail below . it isworthwhile to note that the notion of the vaccine platform is very similar to the traditional product platform concept . the bene ﬁto f these vaccines is that they do not contain the actual disease_causing pathogen in any form . this enables protection from the disease without being at risk of infection . viral vector vaccines use an altered version of a harmless virus , called the vector , to deliver dna ( instructions ) to our body . after entering our cells , this vector carrying the dna gets into the cellnucleus . inside the nucleus , the dna is transcribed to mrna . the mrna exits the nucleus , where the cell machinery translates the mrna to a harmless piece ( usually a protein ) of the virus that causes the disease . the immune system gets triggered by this foreign piece and tries to get rid of it . this helps our bodydevelop the ability to prevent future infection from the same kind of virus [ 25 ] . vaccines based on the viral vectors have a base plat_ form carrier that is usually a harmless virus ( vector ) onto which the dna is embedded to create the vaccine . by tweaking the dna information , a new vaccine can be quickly developed by combiningthe modi ﬁed dna onto the base platform carrier as shown in fig . 3 . table 3shows selected covid_19 viral vector vaccines in clinicaldevelopment according to the who database , including the ones fully approved ( licensed ) and those under the emergency_use_authorization ( eua ) by various governments . mrna vaccines , on the other hand , consist of mrna ( messenger_rna ) strands that help our immune system learn to ﬁght a disease without injecting in any kind of germ . the mrna contains instruc_tions on how to make a harmless piece ( usually a protein ) of the pathogen . once the mrna vaccine is inside our cells ( but outside the nucleus ) , the cells decode the instruction and create the protein . this protein is then identi ﬁed by the immune system which then ﬁghts to neutralize the foreign piece , thereby developing the ability to tackle future infections [ 25 ] . table 4shows selected covid_19 mrna vaccines in clinical development according to the who database , including the onesauthorized for emergency ( eua ) use by various governments . as shown in fig . 4 , vaccines based on this category have a base plat_ form carrier , usually lipid nanoparticles , onto which the mrna is embedded . by tweaking the mrna information , a new vaccine can be quickly developed by combining the modi ﬁed mrna onto the base platform carrier . the immense necessity to manufacture covid_19 vaccine has led to tremendous investments to con ﬁgure vaccines based on fig . 3 two different dna sequences can be used with

, the term biotechnology platforms has gained a lot of attention amongpharmaceutical companies . the main reason is that the product plat_ forms could be quickly redesigned to meet a different speci_ﬁc need . 4.2 vaccines as process_intensive products . ulrich and eppinger [ 7 ] d eﬁne process_intensive products as those which have well_de ﬁned constraints on the product properties such that the product and production process design can not be separated . in many cases , the processes involved in product manufacturing have a lot of limitations and this controls the design of the product to some extent . in addition to this , manufacturing processesinvolved with the production of vaccines are extremely complex and are strictly regulated by agencies such as the fda . this can be observed from the covid_19 vaccine manufacturing case studies described in secs . 3.1and3.2 . hence , vaccines can be cat_ egorized as extremely process_intensive products . in thisregulation_driven manufacturing , we need to have systematic checks for traceability and approval process . information thus gen_ erated is collected , transmitted , and stored as we move along the manufacturing process . this adds to the complexity of designing and controlling the vaccine manufacturing process . if we want tomodel and control the process , we need to identify the different vari_ ables that can be controlled and observed in each step of the vaccine manufacturing process . figure 5shows a general process ﬂow in vaccine development and manufacturing . the variables that can be observed and/or controlled in each of the process steps are listed in table 5 . it might be worthwhile to note that the vaccine manufacturing process involves ingredients such as large biomolecules . living cells serve as the factories forproducing such large molecules . since the largest of such molecules are very small on the submicron scale , there are signi_ﬁcant observa_ tional and measurement challenges . if it is not possible to observe a state of a system and hence unable to measure it directly , the question rises as to how one can properlycontrol these processes to perform quality checks . this leads to the concept of developing mathematical models and estimates based on theories , experiments , experience , or other reliable sources . in other words , when the state of a system is not observable , we need toestimate with mathematical models using the inputs and correlated variables that we can measure . these models help derive indirect measurements . aström and murray [ 26 ] have developed methodologies to build such a model to estimate ˆxof the unknown state of the system when the observer is able to measure a process output y ( along with a noise n ) and the input u . the block_diagram illustrated in fig . 6 depicts this concept . here , the state of the system not observable isx . the block “ observer ” establishes a correlation between the unknown state and measurable variables . it might be worthwhile to note that models , even though might solve the immediateissues , still pose additional challenges in vaccine manufacturing , which are yet to be addressed . 4.3 vaccines as customized products . as the covid_19 vaccines are being manufactured and distributed in a large scale aiming to control the pandemic , new variants of the sars_cov_2 have been identi ﬁed in the united_kingdom ( b.1.1.7 —alpha variant ) , south africa ( b.1.351 —beta variant and b.1.1.529 — omicron variant ) , brazil ( p.1 —gamma variant ) , and india ( b.1.617.2 — delta variant ) . these variants , designated as “ variants of concern ” by the who [ 27 ] , are known to have spread into various parts of the united_states . researchers are of the opinionthat the mutated virus might be able to evade or undercut the effec_ tiveness of the existing vaccines . this might imply that the ﬁrst gen_ eration of the covid_19 vaccines would need an update . developing and manufacturing an updated vaccine to target the mutated virus in the traditional way would require cultivating themutated virus and then highly attenuating or inactivating them . this process could consume a tremendous amount of time and might not be a feasible solution to control the outbreak of anotherpandemic . however , this is not the case with novel vaccine plat_ forms . the covid_19 vaccines made by moderna and p ﬁzer/ biontech , for instance , use mrna in the base platform and instruct the body to produce the spike_proteins found on the virus . these manufacturers point out that novel platform_based vaccinesgive them the ability to swap the module —the coding_region of the mrna candidate ( the instructions to create the protein ) —to match the mutated virus and plug it into the base carrier of the ﬁrst_ generation vaccine to quickly develop the updated vaccine . scientists are also trying to gauge the possibility of including both the old and new forms of the protein in one shot to develop a multivalent vaccine [ 28 ] . all these options are made possible by the vaccine platforming approach , thereby making the vaccine man_ ufacturing process more agile and adaptable . this could be consid_ ered as the “ smartness ” of the novel vaccine manufacturing process , and hence , these novel platform_based vaccines can be considered as highly customizable products . 4.4 vaccines as quick_build products . the main resource required for the development of novel platform vaccines is the genetic sequence of the new virus . the genetic sequence of the virus , once generated , can be rapidly shared across the globe inthe digital format . this information can be then used globally to develop and manufacture vaccines at incredible speeds . according to reports [ 29–31 ] , moderna and p ﬁzer/biontech had conducted phase 1 trials within approximately 2 and 3 months , respectively , fig . 5 generalized work ﬂowchart for vaccine development

h2kgzrvjvuj8g_nak6tryjdmfdwqlbjukp42ikesmtnb0zunku4yuel0b2vuhljgc8fniwi by university of illinois urbana_champaign user on 02 july 2024 after sequence selection and the entire vaccine development process from preclinical study to the emergency authorization by the fda was completed in about 12 months . it is worthwhile to recall that a traditional vaccine development following the same steps would typically take around 10 –15 years . figure 7shows a comparison of the timeline for covid_19 vaccine based on platform technol_ogy versus the projected timeline for a vaccine if developed using the traditional approach . as we can observe from fig . 7 , the time gained with the novel platform_based covid_19 vaccine develop_ ment approach when compared to the traditional approach , sepa_ rately for each step would be roughly 2 years each and in totalabout 10 years . as the highly contagious sars_cov_2 variants such as the b.1.617.2 ( delta variant ) began to spread widely across theglobe , vaccine manufacturers such as biontech have started devel_ oping new versions of covid_19 vaccines targeting the variants . since the covid_19 vaccines are based on novel platforms , updated vaccines targeting the variants can be easily developed by changing the genetic sequence appropriately , within a timeframeas short as four weeks [ 32 ] . these remarkable achievements under_ line the fact that novel platform_based vaccines can be classi ﬁed as quick_build products.additionally , huge cost and time savings can be achieved by bypassing steps including cell culture , harvesting , inactivation , and formulation during vaccine development and manufacturing . bypassing these steps also help in the reduction of overall cycle time , thus enabling rapid manufacturing of platform vaccines . it has been reported that united_kingdom has introduced “ human challenge trials ” where healthy people are exposed to covid_19 virus to identify the effect of the virus on humans and the effective_ ness of vaccines [ 33 ] . these trials , which have been launched after substantial ethical review , are expected to give doctors vital infor_ mation regarding covid_19 disease and the virus , an importantinput to the vaccine development process . hence , rapid develop_ ment and manufacturing of vaccines along with quick trials can make the vaccine essentially a quick_build product . 4.5 vaccines as complex system products . in recent times , the concept of cyber physical systems ( cps ) has been widely used in the ﬁeld of robotics , aviation , automotive systems , industrial control systems , etc . in a typical cps , the hardware and software components are deeply integrated and closely interact with each other [ 34 ] . some examples of cps include autonomous cars , smart grids , and autopilot avionics . the adoption of cps is on the rise , and now , we observe their application in biopharmaceutical products such as the novel platform_based vaccine . in the early stages of covid_19 pandemic , researchers had used “ genomic sequencers ” to sequence the virus causing sars_cov_2 . using this sequence , researchers were then able to select the appropriate gene that goes into the novel platform_based vaccine . this process involves a lot of cutting_edge software and bioinformatics approaches [ 35 ] . when new virus variants are detected , researchers can make appropriate modi ﬁcations in the software code to change the gene sequence that goes inside the vaccine so as to update the vaccine . additionally , the gene sequences can be shared globally with other researchers so that better analysis of viruses and diseasesis possible [ 35 ] . therefore , the novel platform_based vaccine fig . 6 developing estimate ˆxof an unobservable state of the system xwith input u , noise n , and measurable process y [ 26 ] fig . 7 comparison of the development timeline for a novel platform_based covid_19 vaccine and a projected timeline for a vaccine following traditional methods journal of computing and information science in engineering august 2022 , vol . 22 / 040903_7downloaded from http :

between both hardware and software components . any modi ﬁca_ tion in the gene_sequencing software can in ﬂuence and induce changes in the vaccine development process . this makes the novel vaccines complex when compared to the traditional vaccines . the observation that the novel vaccine products fall into seven out of eight product classi ﬁcation types proposed by ulrich and eppinger [ 7 ] is bene ﬁcial for the analysis and future develop_ ment of the vaccine as a product . most of the generic products , including the traditional vaccines , fall only under one of the eight categories , making them less robust and ﬂexible for future improve_ ments . however , novel vaccine products that span across multiple categories are more robust and ﬂexible and offer more degrees_of_ freedom . hence , they support rapid customizations and modi ﬁca_ tions . this is very important for vaccine products since the use cases for vaccines are dependent on the pathogens , which con_ stantly evolve and mutate . 5 future of smart vaccine manufacturing vaccine manufacturing often employs a series of process steps . the manufacturing process and the work ﬂow for each type of vaccine might involve different process steps implemented in differ_ ent sequences . this might pose some unique challenges with respect to setting up the manufacturing facility . for example , there is a challenge with the scaling up of the viral vector vaccinessince new facilities are still under construction [ 36 ] . however , some of the challenges in vaccine manufacturing are similar to those that are addressed by the broader manufacturing community under theconcept of smart manufacturing , which is essentially a transforma_ tion to digital and advance manufacturing techniques . some of these concepts are discussed below with speci_ﬁc applications to the biopharmaceutical industry . 5.1 digitalization of biopharmaceutical industry . the most important features of smart manufacturing include digitalization of the complete manufacturing enterprise with enhanced productivity and seamless information exchange through densely connected devices and intelligent control [ 37 ] . digitalization can transform the industry by enhancing customer_experience , modernizing oper_ations , and revolutionizing business models [ 38 ] . recent and emerging technologies such internet of things ( iot ) , augmented_reality ( ar ) , etc. , are key players in this era of digitization and provide ubiquitous information exchange between people , machines , and even industries . in the context of biopharmaceutical industry , adoption of iot would mean the adoption of smart devices ( such as sensors , actua_ tors , microcontrollers , and radio_frequency identi ﬁcation devices ) to capture , store , and transmit data and services ( such as mobile and web_applications ) to facilitate connections between devicesduring each stage of the vaccine development and manufacturing process . the smart devices would be able to track the temperature of the vaccine products , ingredients and compositions and assign unique identi ﬁers to vials for future reference . cloud_based applica_ tions such as amazon web_services iot can be used to developapplications to monitor and analyze the data being generated at each stage . the ar technology also opens new opportunities for digitaliza_ tion in the biopharmaceutical industry . ar devices such as micro_ soft hololens , google glass and so on can access data from its inbuilt sensors , internal storage , and connected devices and combine them with the operator ’ sﬁeld of view and environment . features such as gesture control help the wearer interact withother devices and products to obtain its properties . for instance , ar devices can be used to identify the serial number of a speci_ﬁc vaccine product by interacting with it using gestures [ 38 ] . 5.2 other enabling technologies . the biomanufacturing roadmap by biophorum operations group ( bpog ) has identi ﬁeda few enabling technologies and capabilities [ 39 ] for embracing smart manufacturing . some of these can be applied to the biophar_ maceutical industry and are discussed below : ( 1 ) automated facilities : this aims for reducing human interac_ tion and improving the quality of production through auto_ mation . in recent times , contaminants were found in the covid_19 vaccine manufactured by a few biopharmaceuti_cal companies [ 40,41 ] . large quantities of vaccines are thrown away during the manufacturing process and/or after manufacturing due to the presence of contaminants , andthis often raises safety concerns . in many cases , contamina_ tions in the vaccine are reported due to mishandling by humans during the manufacturing process . hence , by auto_ mating the process , reducing human interaction , or increas_ ing direct robot –human interaction in a shared_space , the quality of the vaccines could be improved . moreover , there would be higher production rates , ef ﬁcient use of materials , and improved safety . in this regard , automating the facility using robots , collaborative robots ( cobots ) , self_driving vehi_ cles along with digital enablers such as iot , arti ﬁcial intel_ ligence etc. , would be a plausible solution . ( 2 ) modularity and mobility : by creating multiple modules out of the manufacturing process framework , steps including the standardization , validation , con ﬁguration , testing , and assembly become easier . for instance , p ﬁzer manufacturers vaccines through a three_stage process conducted at different facilities , thus creating independent modules out of the com_ plete manufacturing framework [ 19–22 ] . moreover , it enables mobility of the facility , when needed . ( 3 ) knowledge management : with the integration of product and process knowledge , the quality of the product increases and development cost decreases . for example , the adoption of tools to document product and process knowledge , sharing knowledge resources between facilities , and docu_ menting lessons learned from previous experiences will result in ef ﬁcient manufacturing , fewer error , and lower costs . additionally , well_structured and documented infor_ mation and its management using digital technology willboost easy access of information when needed . this increases the speed and quality of the process . ( 4 ) supply_chain_management : a good outline for the supply_chain is only possible through seamless information exchange and trust between collaborators , including theend_users . according to a survey [ 42 ] , about 77 % of the us citizens are extremely concerned regarding the ef_ﬁcacy and , more importantly , the safety of vaccines . hence , a holis_ tic approach is essential to infuse transparency , speed , and accountability across the vaccine supply_chain and distribu_tion system . in this context , the concept of “ blockchain , ” which is a digital record_keeping technology , has gained con_ siderable attention . vaccine supply_chain networks poweredby blockhain technology enable manufacturers to monitor for adverse and unforeseen events , and distributors to gain more visibility and better ability to manage supply_chain disrup_ tions [ 42 ] . moreover , this technology also enhances vaccine safety monitoring including counterfeit detecting , thereby building trust among the public . it is expected that the smart manufacturing paradigm will comple_ ment the efforts to create vaccines at “ lightning speed . ” additionally , the concept of product platforming discussed in the previous section could be incorporated into the smart manufacturing techniques totransform the entire biopharmaceutical sector . however , there are a few barriers such as lack of urgency , economic constraints , limita_ tions with technology infrastructure , unclear company vision , lack of efﬁcient leadership , ambiguity with the ownership , privacy , and security of data [ 38–43 ] that need to be overcome . working toward this goal , the international society for pharmaceutical engi_ neering ( ispe ) is in the process of creating help resources and roadmap to implement industry 4.0 techniques in the 040903_8 / vol . 22 , august 2022 transactions of the asmedownloaded from http : //asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/computingengineering/article_pdf/22/4/040903/6847876/jcise_22_4_040903.pdf ? casa_token=aawhrilvnlyaaaaa : h2kgzrvjvuj8g_nak6tryjdmfdwqlbjukp42ikesmtnb0zunku4yuel0b2vuhljgc8fniwi by university of illinois urbana_champaign user on 02 july 2024 biopharmaceutical sector through a new concept termed as pharma 4.0 [ 44 ] . as the vaccine manufacturing companies strive to improve their productivity and better respond to healthcare require_ ments , the adoption of many smart manufacturing techniques could thus help address several challenges that one might encounter . 6 concluding remarks the vaccine development and vaccine manufacturing methods have a strong connection and have advanced together . the main driver for the vaccine production technology is to make vaccines quickly and safely in a cost_effective manner that would facilitate worldwide distribution . to materialize this , especially in the wakeof the covid_19 pandemic , numerous biopharmaceutical indus_ tries have now switched over from traditional techniques to innova_ tive platform_based technologies . to bring out various aspects and characteristics of the novel covid_19 vaccine development and manufacturing , ulrich and eppinger [ 7 ] classi ﬁcation of products was used as a framework . by leveraging the idea of product platforms , new vaccines could easily be customized by switching the genetic information . thiscan be very bene ﬁcial when trying to deal with mutated virus var_ iants . the novel platform_based vaccines have signi_ﬁcantly reduced the lead time and time_to_market , which was proven during the covid_19 pandemic by biopharmaceutical companies such as p ﬁzer/biontech and moderna . with steps being underta_ ken to conduct quick trials , vaccines can be eventually deemed to be personalized and quick_build products . finally , vaccine products are clearly highly process_intensive , where there are strict regula_ tions in each step of the production process . this has led to issues related to controlling and measuring the state of the systems , which are to be addressed possibly by using analytical and/or data_ driven mathematical models . moving forward , the production of the novel platform_based vac__cines can be scaled up further by biopharmaceutical industries through a partnership with the different platform component pro_ ducers and suppliers based on the changing requirements . further_ more , virtual technology can be used to deliver real_time technical support and training between new and existing facilities , so that nocompromise is made in safety , quality , and integrity . seamless information exchange , which is one of the enablers of smart manu_ facturing , along with ef ﬁcient technology transfer and global part_ nership , will help cut down research and development costs and efforts and make the process more ﬂexible . the research community has also started exploring the possibility of extending the novel platform idea to develop vaccines for dis_ eases apart from covid_19 such as in ﬂuenza . if platform_based vaccine for in ﬂuenza becomes a reality , it would be possible to develop these vaccines in a very short period , thus giving scientistsa longer time frame to effectively identify the virus strains in the next ﬂu season . as a result , the ﬂu shots could be perfectly matched with the virus strains that are dominant in a particular season [ 45 ] . this can increase the ef_ﬁcacy of ﬂu shots . platform_ based options are also being considered for creating personalizedand customizable therapeutics to tackle diseases like cancer . additionally , the information about developing the vaccine plat_ forms and modules could be documented for the possible creationof standards and roadmaps . these could be expanded and updated continuously to lay a strong foundation for interoperability and data exchange . having such standards will not only reduce lead time , errors , and development and delivery costs but also will speed up the regulatory approval process . these standards could also beused to streamline vaccine manufacturing globally to guarantee quality and consistency in the production process , thereby conform_ ing with good manufacturing practices ( gmp ) . 7 disclaimer and acknowledgment certain commercial systems , products , and applications identi_ ﬁed in this paper are not intended to imply recommendation orendorsement by the national institute of standards and technology , nor is it intended to imply that they are necessarily the best available for the purpose . conﬂict of interest there are no con ﬂicts of interest . data availability statement no data , models , or code were generated or used for this paper . references [ 1 ] lin_gibson , s. , and srinivasan , v. , 2020 , “ toward standardization in biotechnology platforms to support smart manufacturing , ” smart sustain . manuf . syst . ,4 ( 3 ) , pp . 250 –253 .

( ahr for infection 0.584 , 95 % ci 0.533 −0.639 and ahr for hospitalization 0.387 , 95 % 0.311 −0.482 ) . sars_cov_2_related deaths were less common in mrna_1273 versus bnt162b2 recipients ( 168 versus 213 ) but this difference was not statisticallysigniﬁcant ( ahr 0.808 , 95 % ci 0.592 −1.103 ) . interpretation in conclusion , although absolute rates of infection , hospitalization and death in both vaccine groups were low regardless of the vaccine received , our data suggests that compared to bnt162b2 , vaccination with mrna_ 1273 resulted in signiﬁcantly lower rates of sars_cov_2_infection and sars_cov_2_related hospitalization . thesedifferences were greater with longer follow_up time since vaccination and even more pronounced in the delta variant era . funding

the other , especially against theb.1.617.2 ( delta ) variant , or as more time from vaccina__tion accrues . differences in effectiveness between these two vaccines would have important clinical and publichealth implications and might also inform the composi_ tion and dosing of future mrna vaccines . although both vaccines include full_length , spike protein_encod_ing mrnas , they have different doses of mrna content ( 100 µg for mrna_1273 versus 30 µg for bnt162b2 ) , interval between doses ( 28 days for mrna_1273 versus21 days for bnt162b2 ) , and composition of the lipid nanoparticle vehicles . it has been suggested that vacci_ nation with mrna_1273 may elicit greater immuneresponses than bnt162b2 . 9some studies suggested a greater drop in vaccine effectiveness over time in bnt162b2 than in mrna_1273 vaccine recipients9and slightly lower vaccine effectiveness against infection10 and hospitalization.8−11the veterans_affairs ( va ) healthcare system , the largest national , comprehensive healthcare system in the u.s. , has vaccinated a very large proportion of itsenrollees using both of the mrna vaccines across the country . it is unlikely that a randomized controlled trial comparing the two vaccines will ever be performed.therefore , we used target trial emulation design 12to compare the two mrna vaccines in the va healthcare system with respect to risk of infection , hospitalization and death . methods study setting and data sources the va provides care at 171 medical centers and 1112outpatient clinics throughout the country . it employs a nationwide electronic health records ( ehr ) system enabling accurate ascertainment of relevant baselinecharacteristics and potential confounders . we used data from the va ’ s corporate data warehouse ( cdw ) , a relational database of va enrollees ’ comprehensiveehr , including the va covid_19 shared data resource , which includes analytic variables provisioned by the va informatics and computing infrastructure ( vinci ) on all va enrollees who were tested for , or vac_ cinated against sars_cov2 and detailed clinical out_ comes for those who tested positive . 13we also used medicare data obtained through the va informationresource center ( virec ) 14to identify any additional va enrollees diagnosed with covid_19 or hospitalized for covid_19 through medicare_covered services the study was approved by the va puget_sound institutional_review_board ( protocol # 01,885 ) , which waived the requirement for informed_consent becausethis was a retrospective study based on electronic health records . speciﬁcation and emulation of target trial : eligibility criteria and study population we designed this observational_study to emulate a target randomized controlled trial of covid_19 vaccination bybnt162b2 versus mrna_1273 in the national va healthcare system with a recruitment period between december 11 , 2020 and march 25 , 2021 and with theprimary endpoints being time from vaccination to sars_cov_2_infection , sars_cov_2_related hospitaliza_ tion or sars_cov_2_related death . 12to facilitate target trial emulation and determine the target trial popula_ tion , we created a cohort of all va enrollees aged 18 years or older who were alive as of 11 december 2020 ( thedate of emergency_use_authorization for bnt162b2 ) and had an inpatient or outpatient encounter in the va health care system in the preceding 12 months ( n=5 766 638 ) ( figure 1 ) . among these , we identiﬁed those who received at least one dose of bnt162b2 or mrna_research in context evidence before this study we searched pubmed for studies published since febru_ ary 2020 by searching all ﬁelds for ( “ bnt162b2 ” or “ mrna_127300or “ covid_19 vaccine ” ) , with no language restrictions . the two mrna covid_19 vaccines ( bnt162b2_and_mrna_1273 ) have differences in dosing , interval between doses and composition of the lipidnanoparticle vehicles . randomized controlled trials comparing the effectiveness of the two vaccines have not been performed . added value of this study to our knowledge , our study is the largest target trial emulation study comparing 902,235 bnt162b2 vaccinerecipients and their matched counterparts who receivedmrna_1273 with a long period of follow_up ( mean fol_ low_up 192 days ) extending into the period of predomi_ nance of the delta variant . compared to bnt162b2 , vaccination with mrna_1273 resulted in signi_ﬁcantly lower rates of sars_cov_2_infection ( adjusted hazards ratio 0.736 , 95 % ci 0.696 −0.779 ) and sars_cov_2_ related hospitalization ( ahr 0.633 , 95 % ci 0.562 −0.713 ) . these differences were greater with longer follow_up time since vaccination and even more pronounced in the delta variant era . implications of all the available evidence primary_series vaccination with two doses mrna_1273 appears to be superior to bnt162b2 against infectionand hospitalization related to the alpha and deltasars_cov_2 variants

withmrna_1273 were eligible to be included in the emula_ tion of the target trial . speciﬁcation and emulation of target trial : treatment assignment we aimed to emulate a target trial that would random_ ize eligible participants after stratiﬁcation by the follow_ ing characteristics : calendar week of vaccination , va integrated service network ( or visn , the 19 administra_tive regions of va 16 ) , age ( 6_year buckets ) and charlson comorbidity index ( cci ) ( 3_point buckets ) . calendar week and visn were selected as stratiﬁcation variablesbecause of the well_described temporal and geographic variability in risk of sars_cov_2_infection . age and cci were chosen because these are the two characteris_tics most strongly associated with development ofsars_cov_2 infection , hospitalization or death in va patients . 17−20we emulated this stratiﬁcation strategy by matching mrna_1273 to bnt162b2 recipients bythese characteristics . to further reduce any residual confounding that might be present after this exact/ coarsened_exact matching step , we executed an addi_tional propensity score matching step ultimately aiming to identify the best mrna_1273 recipient match ( es ) for each bnt162b2 recipient . this strategy of exact match_ing ( calendar week , visn ) , coarsened exact matching ( age , cci ) and propensity score matching was imple_ mented using stata ’ s kmatch command 21 ( statacorp , college station , tx . usa ) . each bnt162b2 recipientwas matched to mrna_1273 recipient ( s ) with replace_ ment and in a 1 : k variable ratio , where k varied based on the number of propensity score ties . we included allties to avoid imbalance due to random pruning . entropy balancing of means in all matching characteristics was included as a reﬁnement in the matching process . thecharacteristics used in the propensity score logistic_regression model were selected a priori and were charac_ teristics associated with the likelihood of getting vacci_nated by bnt162b2 versus mrna_1273 ( the exposure ) and the risk of developing sars_cov_2_infection , hospi_ talization or death ( the outcomes ) in the va population , 17,18,20,22and categorized as shown in table 1 . these characteristics were : age , sex , self_ reported race and ethnicity , urban/rural residence ( based on zip_codes , using data from the va ofﬁce ofrural health , 23which uses the

protective effect immediately after vaccination . missing values . we chose not to impute missing values in bmi and can score ( shown in table 1 ) , but rather modeled them with a missing category as part of thepropensity score logistic_regression model , because “ missingness ” is these two variables is informative and meaningful , and matching for “ missingness ” wouldresult in better matching . missing bmi is an in indica_ tor of va enrollees who had not had their weight mea_ sured in the prior year , while missing can score is anindicator of va enrollees who did not have a primary_care

our target trial emulation study performed in thenational va healthcare system comparing 902,235 bnt162b2 vaccine recipients and their matched coun_ terparts who received mrna_1273 with follow_upextending to august 25 , 2021 demonstrated thatmrna_1273 recipients had a » 26 % reduction in the risk of sars_cov_2_infection ( ahr 0.736 , 95 % ci 0.696−0.779 ) and a_»_37 % reduction in the risk of sars_cov_2_related hospitalization ( ahr 0.633 , 95 % ci 0.562 −0.713 ) compared to bnt162b2 recipients . the magnitudes of these effects were similar across allage groups , comorbidity burden categories and white/ black racial groups . the differences between mrna_ 1273 and bnt162b2 in risk of infection or hospitaliza_tion were progressively greater when the follow_up period was longer , i.e . extending to march 31 , versus june 30 , versus august 25 , 2021 . these differenceswere even more pronounced when we analyzed sepa_rately the outcomes that occurred during the follow_upperiod from july 1 to august 25 , 2021 when the delta variant became predominant in the u.s. ( ahr for infec_ tion 0.584 , 95 % ci 0.533 −0.639 and ahr for hospitali_ zation 0.387 , 95 % 0.311 −0.482 ) . sars_cov_2_related mortality was also lower in mrna_1273 versus bnt162b2 recipients with an ahr of 0.808 ( 95 % ci0.592−1.103 ) ; however , this estimate had a broad conﬁ_ dence interval that crossed one . the absolute risks of all outcomes were low regardless of the vaccine received . our ﬁndings complement and extend those of a recent comparative_effectiveness target trial emulation study of bnt162b2 versus mrna_1273 by dickerman et al. , 10which was also conducted using va data , with some notable differences . first , we supplemented va ehr data with medicare data on additional sars_cov_ 2 infections ( 18.4 % ) and hospitalizations ( 34.6 % ) in vaenrollees that were not documented in va data whiledickerman et al . did not . this would be expected to result in underestimation of absolute risk differences between mrna_1273_and_bnt162b2 in infection andhospitalization rates reported by dickerman et al . addi_ tionally , participants with sars_cov_2_infection prior to vaccination recorded only in medicare data would nothave been identiﬁed and appropriately excluded by dickerman et al . the eligibility criteria and matching methods that we employed resulted in a much greaternumber of vaccine recipients retained as participants in the emulated trial ( 902,235/group versus 219,842/ group ) and a much greater number of outcomes duringfollow_up ( 16,890 versus 2016 infections , 3591 versus411 hospitalizations and 381 versus 81 sars_cov_2_ related deaths ) compared to dickerman et al . this was achieved without sacriﬁcing the comparability of thematched comparison groups in baseline characteristics or negative outcome controls . this makes our results more generalizable and more precise , as well asenabling precise estimates among subgroups of age , cci and race . we compared effectiveness over progres_ sively longer follow_up periods and indeed showedgreater differences between mrna_1273_and_bnt162b2 with longer follow_up , which was not addressed by dick_ erman et al . ( although this can be seen in the risk curvesthey provided ) . our follow_up period for persons vacci_nated up to march 25 , 2021 extended to august 25 , 2021 versus july 1 , 2021 in dicker man et al . this provided lon_ ger mean follow_up in our study ( 192 days versus 126days ) and also enabled assessment extending into the delta predominant period ( which began after july 1 , 2021 ) for persons who were vaccinated many monthsbefore . a notable advantage of dickerman et al . is that they conducted a second target trial with recruitment between july 1 to september 20 to speciﬁcally addressthe comparative effectivenes so ft h et w ov a c c i n e sa g a i n s t the delta variant . it is reassuring that the two emulation studies that were performed completely independently both reported

that the coefﬁcients are equa l across visns.articles 12 www.thelancet.com_vol 45 month march , 2022 a number of test_negative , case_control studies of vaccine effectiveness in hospitalized patients suggested slightly lower vaccine effectiveness against sars_cov_ 2_related hospitalization for bnt162b2 than mrna_1273 . 8 ,9,11for example , among 1175 u.s. veterans hos_ pitalized at 5 va medical centers from february 1 to august 6 , 2021 , vaccine effectiveness was 83.4 % ( 95 % ci 74.0 −89.4 ) for bnt162b2 and 91.6 % ( 95 % ci 83.5 −95.7 ) for mrna_1273 8 ; among 14,636 patients hospi_ talized across nine u.s. states during june_august2021 , vaccine effectiveness was 80.0 % ( 95 % ci 73 −85 ) for bnt162b2 and 95 % ( 95 % ci 92 −97 ) for mrna_ 127311 ; and among 3689 patients hospitalized at 21 u.s. hospitals across 18 states during march 11_august 15,2021 , vaccine effectiveness was 88 % ( 95 % ci 85 −91 ) , for bnt162b2 and 93 % ( 95 % ci 91 −95 ) for mrna_ 1273 . 9our target trial emulation study design has the advantage of being able to directly compare the two vac__cines with respect to risk of infection , hospitalization and death ( rather than just hospitalization ) and wouldbe expected to more closely reﬂect the results of the ran_ domized study that it explicitly attempted to emulate . furthermore , the large study population and large num_ber of outcomes allowed us to conﬁrm that the differ_ence between the two vaccines persisted across all age_groups and comorbidity burden categories . a critical ﬁnding of our study is the widening gap between bnt162b2 and mrna_1237 recipients with respect to risk of infection and hospitalization that was observed as the follow_up period extended from thetime of vaccination until march 31 or june 30 or august 25 , 2021 ( tables 2 and3 ) . this widening gap may reﬂect a greater decline in protection over time after vaccina_tion in bnt162b2 than in mrna_1237 recipients , as was reported in a case_control study in which vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization of bnt162b2dropped from 91 % to 77 % after 4 months but that ofmrna_1237 dropped only from 93 % to 92 % . 9alterna_ tively , this may also reﬂect a greater difference between mrna_1237 and bnt162b2 in protection against thedelta variant ( predominant after july 1 ) than the alpha ( b.1.1.7 ) variant ( predominant before july 1 ) . indeed , the differences between mrna_1273_and_bnt162b2 in risk of infection or hospitalization were much greater when we analyzed separately the outcomes that occurred dur_ing the follow_up period after than before july 1 , 2021 . however , a test_negative , case_control study performed in the uk reported only a small decline in the effective_ness of bnt162b2 against symptomatic disease among persons with the delta variant ( 88 % , 95 % ci 85.3 −90.1 ) than persons with the alpha variant ( 93.7 % , 95 % ci 91.6 −95.3 ) . 7 each dose of mrna_1273 contains > 3 times the dose of mrna than bnt162b2 ( 100 µg versus 30 µg ) , which may elicit greater or longer_lasting immune responses.recipients of mrna_1273 had greater anti_receptor binding domain igg levels than recipients of bnt162b2 , although levels of anti_spike igg were simi_lar . 9differences between the two mrna vaccines in dosing interval ( 28 days for mrna_1273 and 21 days for bnt162b2 ) and composition of the lipid nanoparticlesthat protect and deliver the mrna may also result in different levels of immunogenicity . these differences may inform the design of future mrna vaccines forcovid_19 , other viruses or other conditions , if indeedthe two vaccines are further proven to have different effectiveness . our study has several limitations . despite a sophisti_ cated matching methodology and adjustment for poten_ tial confounders , residual confounding ( e.g . by geographic region smaller than visn level ) can not becompletely excluded in a non_randomized study . how_ ever , health seeking behaviors and prophylactic meas_ ures ( masking , physical distancing , avoiding congregatesettings ) would be expected to be very similar when comparing matched groups of recipients of two differ_ ent vaccines ( rather than comparing vaccinated versusunvaccinated persons ) . in addition , our analysis of anegative outcome control suggested little confounding . while some additional infections ( diagnosed or undiag_ nosed ) and even hospitalizations undoubtedly occurredand were not captured in our analysis , we would expectsars_cov_2 outcome no . of events 24_wk risk (

1273 vaccine recipients . also , some hospitalizations anddeaths that occurred following sars_cov_2_infection may have been unrelated to the infection . this outcome misclassiﬁcation would also be expected to be nondiffer_ential . nondifferential outcome misclassiﬁcation wouldbe expected to produce bias towards the null , with mini_ mal inﬂuence on relative measures of effect such as the ahrs that we reported . our study population is pre_dominantly male , which may limit the generalizability of our ﬁndings to women . our analysis of outcomes limited to the time period of delta predominance ( july 1to august 25 , 2021 ) is potentially biased because it is limited to persons who remained alive and uninfected as of july 1 , many months after “ randomization ” . how_ever , if anything this would be expected to result in anattenuation in the difference between mrna_1273_and_bnt162b2 due to greater “ depletion of susceptibles ” in the less effective bnt162b2 group in the time periodbefore july 1 27 . in conclusion , although absolute rates infection , hos_ pitalization and death in both vaccine groups were low , our ﬁndings suggest that vaccination with mrna_1273 results in signiﬁcantly lower rates of sars_cov_2_infec_ tion and sars_cov_2_related hospitalization than vacci_nation with bnt162b2 , and these differences become more pronounced as time from vaccination accrues . the comparative_effectiveness and safety of the twomrna vaccines should continue to be studied , espe_cially comparisons of “ booster ” doses of the two vac__cines with observation extending to the time period of omicron variant predominance , as they may informdecisions made by governments , healthcare systems and individuals regarding vaccine choices . contributors

first identified in december 2019 , in wuhan china , is a respiratory virus that induces respiratory_distress and a systemic inflammatory reaction in the vasculature mediated by a cytokine storm . currently , 72 million people have been infected with 1.6 million deaths giving a mortality_rate of 2.2 % despite the best post _infective medical intervention available . due to the rapid spread of the covid virus and the worldwide pandemic that has developed , the rush for the development of a vaccine has become a priority amongst health care official ’ s world _wide . in this review , we discuss what is currently known about the mechanism of action , efficacy , and toxicity of three of the most promising vaccines mrna _1273 ( moderna ) , bnt162b2 ( pfizer/biontech ) , chadox1_ncov _19

from these patients allowed for the isolation of a new virus sars _cov _2 ( covid___19 ) 1 . since that report over 72 million individuals have become infected with 1.6 million related deaths .2 the deaths follow a cytokine storm that creates not only pulmonary_edema but a systemic hyperinflammatory state.3 this results in vascular damage , altered blood flow and hypercoagulability of blood with systemic organ damage often inclusive of cardiomyopathy and associated sudden death.4 those most at risk for severe covid are those over the age of 60 , and those with chron ic disease . in both cases , the adaptive immune system is impaired and fails to suppress the innate immune system which is responsible for the cytokine storm .5 the covid__19 virus is a messenger_rna virus that is similar to the common_cold virus . the covid__19 virus enters lung type ii alveolar cells , enterocytes of the small_intestine , arterial and venous endothelial cells , and smooth_muscle cells of the vasculature via its s spike_protein binding the ace2 receptor of the target cells . variances in the expres sion of the ace2 receptor may be partly responsible for difference susceptibility to infections by sex and ethnic group.6 mutations in the s _spike protein have been associated with differences in the virulence of covid__19 subtypes .7 it is against this s pr otein that current vaccines have been developed against to target . there is little knowledge of post _infection joseph angel de soto/ evaluation of the moderna , pfizer/biotech , astrazeneca/oxford and sputnik v vaccines for covid__19 409 advance research journal of medical and clinical scien ce vol . 07 issue 01 page no . 408_414 ( 2021 ) immunity to sars _cov _2 with cases being reported of reinfection . this finding may be a result of the rapid mutation of the covid__19 virus implyi ng the potential need for continuous vaccine development yearly as is the case of flu vaccine.8.9 among the three most promising vaccines are the novel mrna vaccines bnt162b2 ( pfizer/biontech ) , mrna _1273 ( moderna ) and the dna vaccine s chadox1_ncov _19 ( astrazeneca/oxford ) , rad26 ) /rad5 ( sputnik v ) vaccines . here we outline the mechanism of action of these vaccines and compare their safety and efficacy . vaccine mechanism of action the moderna and pfizer/bion tech vaccines are both delivered by lip id nano particles which phospholipid membranes are surrounding the mrna those codes for the s protein of the covid__19 virus . once the lip id nanoparticle is injected , the phospholipid membrane of the nanoparticle will fuse with the host membrane and release the mrna into the cytoplasm of the target cell . the mrna of the s protein is then translated at the rough endoplasmic_reticulum producing the s protein within the cytoplasm . the s protein is then degraded and expressed by major histocompatibility complex i ( mhc i ) and ii ( mhc ii ) . mhc ii is found on antigen presenting immune cells such as macrophages , dendritic_cells , and b _cells . a t _helper cell binds t o the s protein fragment presented by the mhc ii molecule with its tcr protein while it also binds with the mhc ii molecule itself with its cd4 receptor . the t _helper cell then releases interleukins which cause b cells to proliferate and differentiate int o plasma cells . these plasma cells then release specific antibodies to the s protein fragment . these same interleukins cause the original t _helper to proliferate and form t _helper memory cells . ( fig . 1 ) . cytotoxic t cells also play a part by binding to s protein fragments that are expressed by non _ immune cells through the mhc i complex . the cd8 molecule of the cytotoxic t cell will bind to mhc i while the cytotoxic t cell tcr will bind the s protein fragment . the cytotoxic t cell will then release cytokine s that will amplify the t _ helper cells own stimulation of b cell differentiation into plasma_cell proliferation . in addition , the cytotoxic t cell will be primed to kill any infected cells that later present with the s protein of the covid__19 virus . the a strazeneca/oxford vaccine is composed of dna that codes for the s protein and is encased in a capsid from a chimpanzee adenovirus . the adenovirus with the accompanying dna is brought into the cell by endocytosis . once , inside the cytoplasm the dna is relea sed into the cytoplasm . this dna migrates to the cell nucleus where it is transcribed creating mrna that codes for the s protein . this mrna is translated at the rough endoplasmic_reticulum where it creates the s protein in the cytoplasm . as is the case wit h the s protein made by the mrna vaccines above the s protein is processed and presented by the mhc i and mhc ii complexes by non _immune and immune antigen presenting cells , respectively . fig1 . the mrna is delivered via a nano particle to the target cell . the phospholipid membrane of the nanoparticle fuses with the cell membrane releasing the mrna which is translated by the joseph angel de soto/ evaluation of the moderna , pfizer/biotech , astrazeneca/oxford and sputnik v vaccines for covid__19 410 advance research journal of medical and clinical scien ce vol . 07 issue 01 page no . 408_414 ( 2021 ) cell ’ s machinery . an s protein is made and degraded into fragments whi ch are present by mhc ii molecules to t _ helper cells . the t helper cells then release interleukins which stimulate the creation of memory t – helper cells and plasma cells which produce antibodies against parts of the s protein on sars _cov _2 . efficacy the approach to developing vaccines against covid__19 has followed two pathways , a more traditional utilizing dna inserted into a viral capsid and the newer technology of mrna placed within a phospholipid membrane forming a nanoparticle . the advantages of mrn a vaccines are thought to include the use of animal cells or the need for mrna to enter the nucleus of the cell and potentially integrate into the host dna.10 disadvantages include the lower stability of mrna as indicated by the need to store these vaccine s and very low temperatures and a theoretically lesser ability to stimulate the cellular manufacturing of s protein antigen . the moderna vaccine was given to 30,000 individuals with a placebo and non _placebo group ( vaccinated ) . both groups were given injections at day 0 and day 28 . at 14 days , after the second injection both the placebo and the vaccinated groups were evaluated for clinical symptoms . in the non _placebo group , 185 individuals showed clinical symptoms while among the vaccinated group 11 i ndividuals showed clinical symptoms . of the 185 indiv iduals in the placebo group there were 30 severe cases while of those who received the vaccine there were 0 severe cases .11 this gives a maximum efficacy of 94.5 % against the development of clinical symp toms and a maximum efficacy of 100 % against severe_disease . the pfizer/biontech vaccine was given to 43,000 individuals broken up into placebo and vaccinated groups with injections given at day 0 and day 21 . seven days after the second dose was given the trial was unmasked and those with clinical symptoms categorized . in the placebo , group 162 individuals presented with clinical symptoms and 8 in the vaccinated group . this gives an efficacy against clinical symptoms of 95 % . of the 162 symptomatic patients in the placebo group , 9 went on to develop severe_disease while 1 in the vaccine group developed severe_disease . this gives a n efficacy against severe_disease about 87 % for those who developed clinical symptoms . the astrazeneca/oxford dna vaccine or the meningococcal vaccine serving as the baseline was given at day o and again at day 28 with a pcr test looking for infection and not clinical symptoms as earlier discussed at 14 days after the second dose . the size of the study was 12,000 individuals with an efficacy to prevent infection at 70 % and an efficacy to prevent severe_disease at 100 % .12 the sputnik v vaccine produced by the russian federation is a dna vaccine that used two different types of adenovirus vectors rad26 ) and rad5 . the vaccine was adminis tered as follows initially either the rad26 or ra d5 adenovector was administered . this was followed 5 days later by administration of rad26 and 21 days later of rad5.13 pcr was then completed to determine the efficacy by evaluating positive pcr cases between the treatment and placebo groups . the vaccine had an efficacy of 91.4 % in preventing infection however the ability of the vaccine to prevent serious disease was not reported 13 see table i . table 1 comparative efficacy vaccines stu dy size

the most important and common side_effects of vaccines are anaphylaxis , febrile seizure s and autoimmune disease with anaphylaxis generally being the most prevalent of the side_effects that are life threatening.14 other side_effects that are common with vaccines are fever , pain , headache and muscle/joint_pain . the side_effects are gene rally graded as follows : grade 1 are mild adverse_events . ( e.g. , minor event requiring no specific medical intervention ; asymptomatic laboratory findings only ; marginal clinical relevance ) grades 2 are moderate adverse_events ( e.g. , minimal intervention , local intervention . non_invasive intervention ; transfusion ; elective interventional radiological procedure . therapeutic endoscopy or operation ) . grades 3 are severe and undesirable adverse_events ( e.g. , significant symptoms requiring hospitalization or in vasive intervention ; transfusion ; elective interventional radiological procedure ; therapeutic endoscopy or operation ) . grades 4 are life threatening or disabling adverse_events ( e.g. , complicated by acute , life threatening metabolic or cardiovascular compl ications such as circulatory failure , hemorrhage , sepsis ; life –threatening physiologic consequences ; need for intensive care or emergent invasive procedure ; emergent interventional radiological procedure , therapeutic endoscopy or operation ) . grade 5 death . the pfizer/biontech side_effects were categorized by those from the ages of 16 – 55 and those over the age of 55 . for those under the age of 55 headache 42 % , fever 4 % , muscle/joint_pain 33 % and fatigue 47 % . in those over the age of 55 headache 39 % fever 1 1 % mu scle/joint_pain 48 % and fatigue 51 % .15 the pfizer/biontech vaccine has been associated with rare anaphylaxis reactions of 0.63 % of those who have taken the vaccine . however , 0.51 % of those who did not have the vaccine also had an allergic_reaction implying that most of the allergic_reactions where not associated with the vaccine . as most of the individuals had a history of severe allergic_reactions prior to being enrolled to the study it is safe to assume that the actual number of those who had allergi c reactions directly due to the vaccine was actually around 0.12 % while , 0.51 % were most likely exposed around the time of vaccination to an allergen not related to vaccination . the side_effects due to the moderna vaccine were potentially skewed upwards as all the participants were over the age of 56 . the side_effects were also classified at the respective dosages of 25 μg and 100 μg . the reported number of side_effects after the second dose was administered at the reported low and high disease were as fo llows 40 % 84 % headaches ; 18 % 20 % fever ; 60 % 84 % muscle/joint_pain and 50 % 83 % for fatigue.11 there were no serious adverse side_effects reported . the side_effects of the astrazeneca/ biontech vaccine were evaluated with and without the administration of ty lenol . in the group without tylenol headaches were 42 % , fever 51 % , muscle/joint_pain 60 % and fatigue 70 % .12 the group that received tylenol is not reported here as this can mask side_effects . severe adverse_events w ere at 0.3 % and revolved around a case o f hemolytic anemia . the sputnik v vaccines come in two forms frozen and lyophilized . the frozen form was associated with a much higher reporting of side_effects with 100 % reporting hyperthermia , 55 % headache and 25 % muscle/joint_pain , this compared with 3 5 % , 25 % and 30 % for the lyophilized form . most significantly there were no severe reactions ( grade 3 ) reported . interestingly , despite the theoretical advantage of mrna vaccines to have fewer side_effects than dna vaccines this was not observed when compa ring these vaccines except for a modestly higher risk of a fever with the joseph angel de soto/ evaluation of the moderna , pfizer/biotech , astrazeneca/oxford and sputnik v vaccines for covid__19 412 advance research journal of medical and clinical scien ce vol . 07 issue 01 page no . 408_414 ( 2021 ) dna vaccines . it should also be noted that the trials thus far are limited by the exceptionally short time frame of reporting side_effects . additionally , no information on the side e ffects towards children or pregnant women is reported . the side_effects are summarized on table 2 . head ache grad e 1_2 fev er gr ade 1 _2 muscle/ joint_pain grade 1 _2 fatig ue grad e 1_3 seve re adv erse chadox1 nc ov_19 ( astrazeneca /oxford ) c/o tylenol 42 % 51 % 60 %

51 % 0.6 % discussion the 4 vaccines evaluated and compared here all have the ability to minimize infections or the presentation of clinical symptoms . perhaps , more importantly the moderna , astrazeneca/oxford , and pfizer/biontech vaccines all seem to be effective in preventing serious disease with statistically no difference . the short time frame of evaluation however may skew the effectiveness of the vaccines upwards . the short time frame was most likely due to the rush to find a vaccine and the intense competition to influence one ’ s market_share . it is currently unknow n how long the antibody respons e will last against the s protein of the covid__19 virus . covid___19 an rna virus has a very unstable genome and hence like the common_cold of which the virus is related it mutates very rapidly . at this time , there are at least 6 major subtypes which seem to be aggregating geographically . type i in china and southeast_asia , type ii in western europe , type iii is prevalent in the united_states , type iv in japan , type v in australia , and type vi in south america.16 this means that vaccines developed in one part of the world may not be as efficacious elsewhere . the best estimate is 6 _8 months meaning that these vaccines will need to be administered every year in a similar fashion that the flu shot is given . the efficacy of the vaccines did not seem to be depende nt on the technology used as the mrna vaccines and the dna based vaccines seem equally efficacious . the side_effects were relatively minor but quite common . surprisingly , the side_effects of the mrna vaccines had a similar rate as the dna vaccines excludi ng fever where the dna based vaccines were more common . most importantly serious adverse_effects were relatively rare with the caveat there has only been a relatively short time frame . indeed , the safeties of these vaccines or their efficacy in those under the age of 16 and in pregnant women are unknown . the risk for those with a history of allergies may also be elevated . the moderna vaccine must be stored a _ 4 f ( _20 c ) , the pfizer/biontech vaccine at _94 f ( _70 c ) , and the astrazeneca/ oxford vaccine at 36 – 46 f ( 2.2 – 7.8c ) . the ability of the astrazeneca/oxford and sputnik v vaccine s to be stored at normal refrigeration temperature may play a large role in the ability to distribute this vaccine over the others to rural areas and poorer countries .17 joseph angel de soto/ evaluation of the moderna , pfizer/biotech , astrazeneca/oxford and sputnik v vaccines for covid__19 413 advance research journal of medical and clinical scien ce vol . 07 issue 01 page no . 408_414 ( 2021 ) in time it is expected that the virulence of covid virus in terms of its ability to cause serious disease will decrease . this is due to a fundamental principle in microbiology that the more prevalent a microbe becomes the less deadly it becomes , this with the proven ability of these vaccines to limit serious disease means the end of this pandemic is in sight . summary all four of the vaccines evaluated here seem to be effective in either preventing infection or the symptoms of infection . most importantly the moderna , astrazeneca/oxford , and pfizer/biontech vaccines seem effective and nearly equivalent in preventing serious disease due to covid__19 . evidence , for the ability of the sputnik v vaccine to prevent serious disease has yet to be published though it is effective in preventing infection . all four vaccines seem relatively safe with the greatest risk being anaphylaxis , though rare can be life threatening . though these vaccines will more and likely be approved following the completion of their phase_iii cli nical trials one should consider a benefit cost analysis . those at high risk such as those over the age of 60 or with moderate to severe chronic health problems should be the first to receive these vaccines . those at moderate risk such as health care worke rs or in a gray area 40 years and above or with mild chronic disease may also seek to be vaccinated . those who are healthy and under 40 might want to take a watch and wait approach as the full nature of the efficacy and side_effects generally are not compl etely known until sometime after both phase_iii clinical_trials and drug approval have occurred . due to regional subtypes of covid__19 , vaccines created in one part of the world may not be as efficacious elsewhere . the vaccine efficacy and side_effects in those under the age of 16 or in pregnant women is unknown . acknowledgements :

terred b y the use of dated equipment , limited integration of technology as many facilities still mak e use of stem ther _ mometers while c ontinuous temperature track ers and log _ gers as w ell as temperature_sensitiv e alarms are generally lacking at storage sites . henc e , out _of_range temperature may of ten go undetec ted when the monitors are no t on site and this culminates in poor temperature monitoring and control and reduc ed po tency of vac_cines.6 subp ar tr aining of c old chain w orkers human resourc e is integral to the proper func tioning of the cold_chain and the capabilities of the w orkers in this system will invariably hav e an impac t on its efficiency and eff ec_ tiveness . there is an important association betw een regular training and awareness of vac_cine storage b y health w ork_ ers . a study carried out among vac cinators in benin , south _ ern nigeria re vealed that 29.2 % had rec eived no training in cold_chain management , 22.1 % of respondents did no t store vac_cines under appropriate c onditions , 64.9 % had bad cold_chain monitoring prac tices , and 64.2 % had bad prac _ tice of storing heat _sensitiv e vac_cines.7 these findings are similar to those f ound in a study c onduc ted among 457 p ri_ mary health care w orkers in k wara , north c entral nige _ ria , where about half ( 52.1 % ) of the respondents kne w the optimal vac_cine storage temperature , most ( 67 .8 % ) of the participants w ere aware of the shak e test but only 48.8 % of them kne w ho w to c onduc t it . though 58.4 % kne w the vvm stages , only 45.3 % c ould interpret it c orrec tly.8 a similar study c onduc ted in giwa , kaduna , a state in northw estern nigeria to e valuate the kno wledge , at titude and prac tice of cold_chain management among primar y health care w ork_ ers f ound that majorit y ( 71.8 % ) of the respondents kne w the right temperature range f or which vac_cines should be stored . ho wever , only 3.8 % had good kno wledge of c old chain management . while most respondents ( 78.5 % ) showed a positiv e attitude to wards c old chain management , about half ( 51.3 % ) had appropriate prac tice.9 another study c onduc ted in 35 immunization clinics in ile_if e , southw est nigeria , sho wed that only 54 % of vac ci_ nators w ere aware of the shak e test , only 19 % c ould inter _ pret c olour changes on a vac_cine vial monitor and just 29 % of respondents k ept rec ord of vac_cine stock _on_hand.5 difficul ty tr ansp orting v accines t o endp oints availabilit y of po tent vac_cines in sufficient quantit y to the end users is crucial to the suc cess of the c old chain . ho w_ ever , there are areas that are difficult to reach due to un _ navigable terrain , poor ac cess roads and distanc e to storage sites.10 individuals in hard_to_reach areas c onsequently have low vac cination c overage . a study re vealed that o ver one_third of polio in 2013 w ere from under _immuniz ed and hard_to_reach areas and vac_cine c overage in some of these areas was as lo w as 23 % f or oral p olio v accine 3 and 22 % for p entavalent vac_cine 3.11 although transportation from national to state stores is quite reliable , there are numerous breakdo wns in the supply_chain from local c old stores to endpoints . these unac ceptable indic es aren ’ t peculiar to nigeria . drawing c omparisons with ghana , a study carried out in a rural distric t in ghana re vealed an av erage sc ore of 60 % , 32 % , 27 % , 53 % and 16 % in the areas of temperature c ontrol , stock management , distribution , vac_cine management and information system respec tively.12 similarly , exposure of vaccines to out _of_range temperature is a widespread prob _ lem in cameroon as studies c onduc ted in f orty health facil _ ities located in 8 distric ts in cameroon re vealed that only 52.5 % ( 21 of 40 facilities ) , 20.6 % ( 7 of 34 facilities ) had at least one free zer and c onstant po wer supply respec tively while almost 27 .5 % of the health facilities w ere c onduc ting epi ac tivities without any c old chain equipment.13 simi _ larly , a study c onduc ted in 94 health c entres in the c entral region in t ogo re vealed that appro ximately 30 % of these facilities lack ed refrigerators f or storing vac_cines while 19 % had refrigerators w ere out damaged or out of c ommission.14 overall , there is limited progress in achie ving univ ersal ac _ cess to immunization in sub_saharan africa as only 13 % of countries in the region achie ved 80 % c overage in each dis _ trict in 2015 and in 2016 , only 19 % of the c ountries sup _ ported b y the global allianc e for v accines and immuniza _ tion met the who ’ s 80 % benchmark f or eff ective vac_cine management.15 stora ge peculiarities of c ovid_19 vaccines the adv ent of the c ovid_19 vac_cines hav e ushered in a ray of hope in dealing with this deadly pandemic . ho wever , low_ and middle_inc ome c ountries ( lmic ) such as nigeria need to figure out ho w to pro tect its teeming population and meet up with the storage_requirements of the vac_cines . the pfiz er and moderna vac_cines w ere designed with mrna technology that requires intensely c old storage to elongate shelf _life . the pfiz er variant requires storage at _70°c ± 10°c f or up to ten days unopened and on get ting to its point of use , it can either be stored in ultra_lo w temper _towards eff ective and efficient c ovid_19 vac cination in nigeria journal of global_health r eports 2 ature free zers f or up to six months , in thermal shippers f or up to 30 days whilst refilling with dr y ice every five days and regular hospital refrigeration units at 2_8°c f or up to fiv e days . onc e thaw ed or refrigerated under 2_8°c , the vac_cine canno t be refro zen.16 on the o ther hand , the moderna vari _ ant can be stored at _20°c f or up to six months , 2_8°c f or up to 30days within the six _month shelf lif e after thawing and at room_temperature f or up to 12hours.17 the o xford_astraz eneca vac_cine uses double_stranded dna technology unlik e the single_stranded mrna technol _ ogy emplo yed b y pfiz er and moderna . henc e , it has lo wer chanc es of degrading at lo wer temperatures and can there _ fore be stored at regular refrigerator temperature . c onse _ quently , it has a shelf _life of 6months when refrigerated at 2_8°c . furthermore , the o xford_astraz eneca vac_cine c osts us $ 3_4 ( n1,143_1,524 ) as opposed to us $ 37 ( n14,098 ) f or moderna and us $ 20 ( n7621 ) f or pfiz er.18 solutions on st ora ge and distribution histor y has demonstrated that a vac_cine in itself is no t a panac ea ; it is pertinent that logistical and c old_chain sys _ tems are efficient in the storage and distribution of vac_cines to ensure po tency upon administration . owing to the high cost and storage_requirements of the moderna and pfiz er vaccines respec tively , the o xford_astraz eneca vac_cine ap _ pears a f easible alternativ e for lmics lik e nigeria . while challenges with the nigerian c old chain system abound , the following can be emplo yed to ensure suc cess in vac cinating majorit y of nigerians against the no vel coronavirus : reorganiz e supply_chain . the federal go vernment of nigeria is in c ontrol of tw o levels of the chain including the nscs . a 3_hub system was designed to reduc e the bur _ den on the nscs af ter an analysis of the nphcd a storage challenges . the 3_hub system inv olves kano , abuja ( nscs ) and lagos z onal storage sites rec eiving vac_cines direc tly from suppliers and deliv ering them direc tly to states stud _ ies sho w that mo ving from the tw o tier f ederal system to a single 3_hub f ederal system w ould reduc e storage needs b y 30 % 3 lower cost of operations leaving z onal stores available for a sudden increase in capacit y requirement . additionally , the implementation of the 3_hub f ederal system will f oster promp t availabilit y of vac_cines to states b y eliminating the zonal le vel . increase storage capacit y and integration of rec ent technology . effective storage of vac_cines is an integral component of the supply_chain management as it ensures that vac_cines do no t lose their po tency . recent study showed that f or current vac_cine programs e.g . p olio , bacil _ lus calmet te_guerin , t etanus etc . , there is a need f or in _ crease in storage capacit y at all z onal le vels within the f ed_ eration to reach 100 % reliabilit y. theref ore , an e xpansion of the current storage facilities is a prerequisite prior to ac _ quiring the c oronavirus vac_cines . due to the unreliabilit y of nigeria ’ s po wer sec tor , funding should be channeled to _ wards procuring clean and efficient c ooling technologies such as solar _powered refrigerators . additionally tempera _ ture monitoring and c ontrol de vices should be introduc ed into the c old chain system . these de vices giv e real_time temperature , alert w orkers when out _of_range tempera _ tures are detec ted causing them to inter vene and ultimately preser ve the po tency of vac_cines and pre vent wastage . train vac cinators and technicians . in o ther to meet up with the need to rapidly vac cinate as many nigerians as possible , vac cinators who can be mobiliz ed swif tly will be required . as such , the number of vac cinators required may exceed the number of currently trained and e xperienc ed vaccinators , particularly because the e xistent immunization workforce will be required to maintain the npi . it is unar _ guably a nec essit y that the vac cinators f or c ovid_19 re _ ceive comprehensiv e training and c ompetency assessment to ensure that those who rec eive the vac_cine are saf e and more so , public c onfidenc e in the proc ess is established . a complete online c ourse on c ovid_19 vac cination training has been draf ted b y the who in c onjunc tion with the united_nations children ’ s fund ( unicef ) f or use b y coun_ tries in the training of frontline health w orkers . this re _ sourc e can be adap ted b y nigeria ’ s ministr y of health , translated to major ethnic dialec ts , and used in the training of the nation ’ s covid_19 vac cination w orkforce . additionally , maintenanc e and repair of c ce requires e x_ tensiv e technical kno w_how . the av erage time tak en to re _ pair a fridge at the l ga le vel of the c old chain in nigeria is two months to tw o years . henc e , it is important f or nige _ ria to adop t hands_on training approach of technicians at local technical c olleges and tertiar y institutions and spare parts f or c ces should also be made readily available . this will create an e xtensiv e workforce that can promp tly detec t and tackle problem with c ces and this will ultimately strengthen storage and distribution capacit y . this method which was adop ted in ethiopia led to the training of 516 technicians and restoration of 100m2 cce capacit y. cce maintenanc e and repair is currently in the module of some technical c olleges in ethiopia and t anzania.19 adequa te needs forec asting estimation of capacit y and vac_cine needs is piv otal to the efficiency of the c old chain giv en that it tak es appro xi_ mately tw o years to procure and install c old chain equip _ ment.19 needs estimation can be done using pre vious c on_ sump tion ( assessed at the national le vel ) , target population ( assessed at the national le vel ) and siz e of immunization sessions ( assessed at the primar y health c entres and o ther facilities where the vac_cines are giv en ) 20 veritable data also needs to be tak en particularly at the local le vel where visi _ bility into vac_cine inv entor y levels is generally lo wer as the accuracy of f orecasting and needs estimation depends on the sourc e data used.3 the who epi f orecasting tool is v ery useful f or this proc ess as it analyses diff erent sc enarios and also pro vides a multiy ear f orecast ( three to fiv e year pe _ riod ) of vac_cines , saf e injec tion supplies , storage capacit y and c old chain equipment.20 devel opment of mobile sessions for hard_t o_ rea ch areas in order to ensure adequate c overage in hard_to_reach ar _ eas , immunization outreaches and adop tion of non_generic transportation methods to circumv ent transportation bar _ riers should be c onsidered . mobile teams should be created and equipped with boats f or coastland and o ther v ehicles towards eff ective and efficient c ovid_19 vac cination in nigeria journal of global_health r eports 3 capable of navigating various terrains . distribution of c ovid_19 v accines salient ethical c onsiderations should guide the distribution of the c ovid_19 vac_cines . in light of the limitation in vac _ cine supply , the who strategic advisor y group of experts on immunization ( sa ge ) proposed a 3_stage prioritization roadmap f or vac_cine administration where ( 1_10 % of a countr y ’ s to tal population is vac cinated in stage 1 , ( 11_20 ) % in stage 2 , and ( 21_50 ) % in stage 3.21 the public health strategy emplo yed in the administration of vac_cines should depend on the burden of disease and the local epi _ demiology . the current epidemiological set ting in nigeria is that of c ommunit y transmission.22 henc e , health w orkers and older_adults within the c ountr y_defined specific age cut_off should be prioritiz ed for vac cination in stage 1 . in stage 2 , older_adults no t covered in stage 1 including per _ sons with c omorbidities , disadvantaged or persecuted groups , se xual minorities , people living with disabilities , refugees , internally displac ed persons , health w orkers in _ volved in immunization deliv ery , high priorit y teachers and school staff should be vac cinated . in stage 3 , o ther teachers and school staff , other essential w orkers outside health and education sec tors , pregnant w omen etc . should rec eive the vaccine.21 conclusions despite the numerous challenges plaguing the system , op _ portunities are equally numerous . a sturdy roadmap , strong political will and intense c ollaborations will increase the feasibilit y of the proposed solutions . a ccurate data c ollec _ tion and appropriation of funds should also be prioritiz ed in order to design and implement the af orementioned so _ lutions . with a teeming population of o ver 200million peo _ ple , e xtreme po verty levels , limited primar y health c entres , cold_chain equipment and storage capacit y , procurement of the o xfordastraz eneca variant is more in c onsistenc e with our realities if w e are going to achie ve a nationwide c over_ age . finally , outsourcing a carefully calculated perc entage of storage and distribution to ac credited private facilities under the pur view of the local go vernment may reduc e the burden of vac_cine storage on the go vernment and facilitate effective and efficient vac cination against c ovid_19 in the countr y

coronavirus – review a comprehensive review of sars_cov_2 vaccines : pfizer , moderna & johnson_&_johnson rikin patela , mohamad kakia , venkat s. potluria , payal kaharb , and deepesh khanna a adr . kiran c. patel college of osteopathic medicine , nova southeastern university , clearwater , fl , usa ; bdepartment of health sciences , marieb college of health & human services , florida gulf coast university , fort myers , fl , usa abstract the novel coronavirus outbreak was declared a pandemic in march 2020 . we are reviewing the covid_19 vaccines authorized for use in the united_states by discussing the mechanisms of action , administration , side_effects , and efficacy of vaccines developed by pfizer , moderna , and johnson_&_johnson . pfizer and moderna developed mrna vaccines , encoding the spike_protein of sars_cov_2 , whereas johnson_&_johnson developed an adenovirus vector_based vaccine . safety has been shown in a large cohort of participants in clinical_trials as well as the general population since emergency approval of vaccine administration in the us . clinical_trial results showed the pfizer and moderna vaccines to be 95.0 % , and the johnson_&_johnson vaccine to be 66.0 % effective in protecting against moderate and symptomatic sars_cov_2_infection . it is important to keep medical literature updated with the ongoing trials of these vaccinations , especially as they are tested among different age_groups and upon the emergence of novel variants of the sars_cov_2 coronavirus.article history received 7 june 2021 revised 29 september 2021 accepted 31 october 2021 keywords vaccine ; covid_19 ; coronavirus ; sars_cov_2 ; pfizer ; moderna ; johnson_&_johnson introduction the sars_cov_2 virus is responsible for the covid_19 pandemic that has infected hundreds of millions and resulted in millions of deaths worldwide.1 in the majority of the patients , sars_cov_2 presents as a respiratory infec _ tion causing fever , chills , cough , difficulty breathing , and other associated symptoms.2,3 serious covid_19 infection resulted in the use of ventilator support and organ damage.4 as a result of the rapid spread and burden of disease of the novel coronavirus , researchers and pharma _ ceutical companies had to develop vaccines using preexist _ ing or novel technologies rapidly . in the u.s. , there are currently three vaccines being administered broadly . these vaccines were developed by pfizer_biontech , moderna , and johnson_&_johnson . pfizer_biontech and moderna devel _ oped mrna vaccines targeting the surface protein of sars_cov_2 . johnson_&_johnson used preexisting technol _ ogy with an adenovirus vector to trigger an immune response and offer protection for subsequent infection.5 currently , data from clinical phase_iii trials have been released and show that these vaccines are effective in pre_ venting infection and disease.6 the pfizer_biontech bnt162b2 vaccine was approved by the fda on august 23 , 2021 , after meeting the fda requirements for efficacy , manufacturing , and safety.7 this review will evaluate cur_ rent data showing the efficacy of these three vaccines in preventing coronavirus infection . additionally , new variants of sars_cov_2 have emerged recently . each vaccine has had differing responses to the variants that will be discussed as well as other differences between the vaccines , such as administration and adverse_effects.8pfizer–biontech mrna covid_19 vaccine bnt162b2 development pfizer ’ s covid_19 vaccine was the quickest vaccine to be developed , taking just about 7 months after its phase i/ii trial took place in may 2020 for the fda to allow for its emergency use in december 2020.8 the previous record set by pharmaceutical company merck took 4 years to develop the world ’ s first effective vaccine against mumps in 1967 . with cases nearing 5 million and deaths just shy of 150,000 globally in may 2020 , pfizer began phase i/ii testing . the study included 45 participants divided into three groups , with each group containing 15 participants . group 1 was supplied two 10 μg doses , separated by 21 days . group 2 was given 2 30 μg doses , separated by 21 days . group 3 was administered a single 100 μg dose . to compare the immuno _ genicity of the vaccine to individuals who recovered from infection , human convalescent sera ( hcs ) were extracted from 38 patients 14 days after the pcr_confirmed diagnosis . the receptor_binding domain ( rbd ) is part of the virus that binds to a receptor within the host and facilitates entry of the virus into host_cells . the rbd igg is sufficient for serological testing because neutralizing_antibodies can act here and pre_ vent sars_cov_2 entry into host_cells . remarkably , hcs revealed an rbd_binding igg concentration of 602 u ml−1 compared to group 2 , which showed an rbd_binding igg concentration of 16,166 u ml_1 . group 1 demonstrated an rbd igg concentration of 5,880 u ml−1 d. group 3 displayed an rbd_binding igg concentration of 1,260 . all rbd_bind _ ing igg concentrations were measured 35 days after admin _ istration of the first dose . these findings demonstrated that

producing antibodies against sars_cov_2 signifying a pivotal moment in the fight against the pandemic.8 with the success of the phase i/ii trial , pfizer and biontech were approved to proceed to phase_iii testing . as the ability of the bnt162b2 vaccine to produce neu_ tralizing antibodies to the rbd of sars_cov_2 was now well established , the phase_iii trial would determine the safety and efficacy of the vaccine . a total of 43,448 parti _ cipants 16 years or older were gathered and received the vaccine . of which , 21,720 received 2 30 μg doses of the bnt162b2 vaccine separated by 21 days and 21,728 received placebos.9 figure 1 explains the developmental milestone of pfizer_ biontech mrna vaccine . on january 12 , 2020 , the genetic sequence of sars_cov_2 was made public.5 in late april , pfizer and biontech began phase i/ii testing in germany with 12 participants dosed with bnt162 . phase i/ii testing in the us begun less than two weeks later with 360 subjects receiving doses . in late july 2020 , pfizer announced that they will start phase_iii testing with 2 , 30 µg doses admi _ nistered to over 30,000 subjects . in november 2020 , pfizer concluded phase_iii testing and announced an efficacy of 95.0 % . on december 11 , 2020 , the fda authorized emer _ gency use of bnt162b28 and on august 23 , 2021 , the us fda approved the pfizer vaccine making it the first approved covid_19 vaccine.10mechanism of action the pfizer and moderna vaccines express similar mechanisms of action . the vaccine contains a nucleoside_modified mrna that encodes the sars_cov_2 spike glycoprotein and is deliv _ ered in lipid nanoparticles for more efficient delivery into host_cells.11 the mrna specifically encodes for the s2_p antigen , consisting of the sars_cov_2 glycoprotein with a transmem _ brane anchor . binding antibody responses against s2_p were used as a method of evaluating efficacy . the vaccine ’ s goal is to elicit both b_ and t_cell responses against the spike_protein . as per published data , the vaccine was successful in inducing antibody responses to both full_length s2_p and receptor_bind _ ing domain . the potent lipid_nanoparticle delivery system used by the vaccine in combination with the use of modified nucleotides that avoid early activation of interferon_associated genes are unique features that contribute to its efficacy.12 the mrna vaccine intends to produce prolonged protein expres _ sion , induction of antigen_specific t_follicular helper cells , and activation of germinal_center b cells.13 efficacy in a study conducted by polack et al. , among 36,523 partici__ pants with evidence or no evidence of existing or previous sars_cov_2 infections , 8 cases were observed in participants who received the vaccine ( at least 7

vaccine efficacy of 52.0 % was observed which demonstrates the early protection against infection the bnt162b2 vaccine provides 12 days after the first dose . this 52.0 % efficacy is based on the occurrence of 39 cases in the bnt162b2 vaccine group and 82 cases in the placebo group between the time of administration of the first dose and second dose.14 the pfizer phase_iii study includes over 46,000 participants globally , and on november 18 , 2020 , efficacy data were sufficient for the fda to grant an eua for vaccine administration in the us . the study assesses infections occurring 7 and 14 days after the second dose in participants who have either not had or had a previous infection . the results found a 95.0 % efficacy in preventing infection 7 days after second dose administration in participations , with these results being pivotal in the fda granting an eua for the vaccine in the us.14 on march 31 , 2021 , pfizer and biontech announced a remarkable 100 % vaccine efficacy in young adolescents after a phase 1/2/3 trial that involved the administration of the bnt162b2 vaccine in over 2000 adoles _ cents aged 12–15.15 effectiveness against multiple genetic variants of sars__cov_2 the first case of a mutant variant reported in the united_states was december 29 , 2020 , in denver , colorado . cases caused by two common mutant variants of sars_cov_2 were initially arose in the united_kingdom and south africa . since then , there have been many reports of several other mutant variants globally . these variants have caught public attention for two reasons : a . ) uncertainty of the vaccine coverage against these mutants and b . ) the ability for these mutants to spread more rapidly . the latter has been explored by tian et al. , who demonstrated that the b.1.1.7 variant , which contains the mutation n501y , a mutation in the spike_protein that allows for binding to the host_cell receptor angiotensin_converting enzyme ( ace2 ) showed 4 times higher binding affinity to ace2 than the wild_type virus.16 this significant finding , among other factors , contributes to the ability of these variants to spread faster . as the cases of variants increase globally , a question that has dominated headlines was how effective cur_ rently available vaccines will be against these variants . common among several variants is the n501y mutation , a mutation in a gene that codes for the receptor_binding domain ( rbd ) that is selectively targeted by the bnt162b2 vaccine . in january 2021 , xuping et al . extracted serum from patients vaccinated with the bnt162b2 vaccine and measured the abil_ ity of their antibodies to neutralize variants expressing the n501y mutation.17 despite the n501y mutation found within the spike_protein , which is targeted by the bnt162b2 vaccine , this study demonstrates that there is no reduction in the efficacy of the bnt162b2 vaccine against mutant strain n501y relative to the original strain.17 given these findings , there is no current indication for the need to develop a new vaccine against these mutant strains . it is important to mention that as more mutant variants continue to be discovered , more research needs to be conducted to identify potential changes in vaccine coverage and spreading rates . in israel , the pfizer vaccine efficacy was determined in indivi _ duals ages 16 and up , a population of approximately 6.5 million people . the goal was to approximate the efficacy of the two_dose regimen . the authors interpreted data from january 24 to april 23 , 2021 . within this time , there were 232,268 infections , 7694 hospitalizations , 4481 critical hospitalizations , and 1113 deaths . by april 3 , 2021 , 72.1 % of individuals in this age_group had received both pfizer vaccine doses . additionally , infected individuals were tested for the prevalence of variant strains . of these samples , 94.5 % were the b.1.1.7 variant . the authors concluded that the b.1.1.7 variant was the predominant strain in israel . after both doses were administered , the data showed that the pfizer vaccine was effective in all ages for asymptomatic and symptomatic infec _ tion , hospitalization , and death , including infections with the b.1.1.7 variant . in individuals above the age of 16 , the vaccine was 95.3 % effective in preventing infection , 91.5 % for asympto _ matic infections , 97.0 % for symptomatic infections , 97.2 % for hospitalizations , 97.5 % for critical hospitalizations , and 96.7 % effective in preventing death . critical hospitalizations were defined as situations requiring the use of a mechanical ventilator or the occurrence of organ failure . there were zero deaths in individuals 16–44 , and the mortality incidence rate was 0.1 out of 100,000 persons per day . this showed that the two_dose pfizer vaccine was effective in preventing asymptomatic and sympto _ matic infection , hospitalization , and death in regard to sars__cov_2 as well as the b1.1.7 variant.18,19 a booster , or third dose , of the vaccine was approved for use in patients over 60 in israel on july 30 , 2021 . the immuno _ genicity of the booster was analyzed by bar_on et al . and showed a lower rate of infection in participants receiving the booster . additionally , incidence of severe infection was decreased by a factor of 19.5 in the booster group.20 the safety profile was also similar to the already reported systemic reac_ tions in previous clinical_trials , with preliminary results show _ ing no increased risk of adverse_events or systemic_reactions caused by the third booster dose.21 efficacy of pfizer vaccine on b.1.617.2 strain the first case of infection caused by the delta variant , b.1.617.2 , was reported in india in october 2020.22 this mutant variant has been dubbed the “ double mutant ” because of two mutations found in the rbd . research has suggested table 1 . pfizer_biontech efficacy

in increased transmissibility . the impact these mutations have on current vaccines is still being researched ; however , research in several countries has shown a decline in efficacy against the delta variant , which has been categorized as a variant of concern by the world_health_organization . in qatar , vaccine efficacy against b.1.617.2 infec _ tion was found to be 64.2 % 14 days after the first dose and 53.5 % 14 days after the second dose in preventing hospitaliza _ tion and death . the vaccine was less effective in preventing infection but was able to prevent the worst outcomes of hospi _ talization and death.23 in the united_kingdom , there was a 33.5 % efficacy after the first dose and 59.8 % efficacy after the second dose against the b.1.617.2 variant in preventing symp _ tomatic infection.24 in the united_states , there has been further analysis of the b.1.617.2 variant . after two doses , there was an initial 88.0 % protection against symptomatic infection in the first month and a progressive decline to 47.0 % efficacy after five months . in the first month after vaccination , there was a 75.0 % efficacy in preventing moderate_to_severe infection . in all ages , the vaccine was 93.0 % in preventing hospitalization . these results raise the question whether the gradual decline in effi_ cacy is due to the decreasing antibody response over time or the mutations in the b.1.617.2 variant allowing for immune evasion.25 in israel , sampling of infected patients showed a high prevalence of the delta strain , and efficacy showed a 39.0 % efficacy against asymptomatic infection , 40.5 % against symptomatic infection , 88.0 % against hospitalization , and 91.4 % against severe or critical cases.18 table 1 presents efficacy values for symptomatic b.1.617.2 infection and severe or fatal infection requiring hospitalization . safety profile : side_effects and contraindications safety results from the phase_iii trial were obtained up to 14 weeks after the second dose was administered to capture potential delayed adverse_reactions . tolerability to the vaccine , defined as local and immediate reactions , and systemic adverse_effects in individuals after receiving the second dose are shown in table 2 . the most common local reaction reported among participants was mild_moderate pain at the site of injection , which lasted up to one week . younger patients reported pain at the site of injection ( 83.0 % after the first dose , 78.0 % after the second ) more frequently than older patients ( 71.0 % after the first dose , 66.0 % after the second dose ) .4 systemic_reactions were far more common in the second dose and again , more common in younger participants than in older patients with the most com _ mon adverse_effects including fatigue , headaches , and less fre_ quently reported fever ( ≥38°c ) . of the older_adults , 39.0 % reported headaches , 51.0 % reported fatigue and 11.0 % reported fever . of the younger patients , 52.0 % reported headaches , 59.0 % reported fatigue and 16.0 % reported fever.4 it should be noted that the reports of fatigue and headache were commonly reported among placebo participants as well ( 23.0 % and 24.0 % respectively ) .10,14 in a study published in the british journal of anesthesia , lene h. garvey and shuaib nasser discuss the occurrence of two anaphylactic responses seen in two national_health_service workers who received the bnt162b2 vaccine on the second day of the vaccine trial.26 the anaphylactic response was potentially linked to the role polyethylene glycols ( peg ) might have played in these reactions . peg is a component of the bnt162b2 vaccine and is used as an adjuvant , helping the body produce a stronger immune response . anaphylactic responses seen in patients with peg allergies are typically major systemic_reactions with a rapid onset . due to the rapid nature as well as the severity of the anaphylactic response observed in the two nhs workers , garvey and nasser emphasize that the role of peg can not be overlooked . myocarditis has been reported after administration , espe _ cially after the second dose . in adults , the prevalence of myocarditis was 3.5 cases per 1 million_doses . when dis_ cussing vaccines , a risk and benefit analysis is always neces _ sary and the fda and cdc determined the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing hospitalization and mortality offset the increased risk of myocarditis.27 another rare ae reported was bell ’ s palsy . bell ’ s palsy has previously been associated with administration of other viral vaccines , in addition to sars_cov_2 . renoud et al . compared this to cases of bell ’ s palsy associated with other viral vaccines and did not find an increased or disproportionate risk of contracting bell ’ s palsy with the pfizer_biontech vaccine.28 as the vaccine distribu _ tion increases globally , the adverse_effects should continue to be carefully monitored . contraindications to the bnt162b2 vaccine , as highlighted in fda guidelines include those with known severe allergic_reactions to any components of the pfizer_biontech vaccine.27 administration according to fda guidelines , the bnt162b2 vaccines are administered as a series of two intramuscular ( deltoid ) injec _ tions of 0.3 ml separated by 3 weeks.27 the bnt162b2 vac__cines are distributed in thermal containers in dry_ice . once received , according to fda storage guidelines , vials may be stored in ultra_low temperature freezers −80°c to −60°c for up to six months or in common hospital freezers between −25°c and −15°c for up to two weeks . if needed , vials may be kept in special transport thermals for up to 30 days ( refilled every 5 days with dry_ice ) . vials may be thawed at room_temperature ( 25°c ) for no more than 2 hours or thawed in refrigerators ( 2° c_8°c ) for no more than 5 days.27table 2 . tolerability and systemic adverse_effects experienced by pfizer vaccine

full list of ingredients of the bnt162b2 vaccine includes : mrna , lipids , potassium chlor _ ide , monobasic potassium phosphate , sodium chloride , dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate , and sucrose.27 moderna covid_19 vaccine ( mrna_1273 ) development moderna was one of the first pharmaceutical companies to pledge to develop a vaccine against covid_19 . on february 7 , the first batch of the moderna vaccine was developed and ready to use for analytical testing . the nih was an early proponent of the mrna_1273 vaccine , given that it worked in collaboration with moderna in investigating the mrna sequence for covid_19 virus.29 on march 16th , the first patient in phase 1 clinical_trials was dosed with the mrna_ 1273 vaccine . one month later , barda announced a grant of up to $ 483 million to accelerate the development of the vac__cine . on may 1 , moderna in collaboration with lonza announced a strategic partnership to develop around 1 billion mrna_1273 vaccine doses per year . on may 12 , moderna received the fda fast track designation for mrna_1273 , as the global need for a vaccine increased . vaccine trial results were published in the new england journal of medicine and were well received internationally . after positive results from the phase 1 and phase 2 trials , barda continued their sup_ port , and phase 3 trials of the mrna_1273 vaccine began on july 26 , 2020 . moderna signed an initial supply agreement with the u.s. government to provide the first 100 million_doses of mrna_1273 vaccine . after the first analysis of the phase 3 trial was released on november 16 , 2020 , it was determined that the moderna vaccine has a longer shelf_life at refrigerated tem_ peratures . this finding was significant , as it positively influ _ enced the logistics of distributing the vaccine . on november 30th , 2020 , moderna filed for emergency_use_authorization with the u.s. fda , and received approval shortly after.29 the u.s. cdc advisory_committee_on_immunization_practices has recommended the use of the moderna vaccine in individuals 18 years and older . adolescents were included in the phase 2/3 trials , and results are yet to be published . in the meanwhile , the moderna mrna_1273 vaccine is currently undergoing phase 1/2 trials in japan , led by takeda_pharmaceutical_company . in recent months , clinical data suggesting that there are new variants of covid_19 has emerged . on january 25 , 2021 , moderna published results from in vitro neutralization studies from sera from infected individuals indicating that the vaccine has activity against variants identified in the u.k. and the republic of south africa.29 on may 10 , 2021 , the fda granted approval for the emergency use of moderna vaccine in adolescents between 12 and 18 years_of_age.10 figure 2 explains the developmental milestone of the moderna mrna vaccine . the duration of time from the start of phase 1 trials to fda approval for the moderna vaccine was approximately 9 months . prior to the initiation of clinical_trials , the nih and moderna worked in tandem to finalize the mrna sequence for covid_19 . phase 1 and phase 2 study

author _ ization shortly thereafter.11,29 mechanism of action the pfizer and moderna vaccine both use mrna technology and are considered to have similar mechanisms of action.30 this mechanism is discussed on page 5 . efficacy the moderna mrna_1273 vaccine is 94.1 % effective at pro_ tecting against symptomatic covid_19 after administration of the second dose . the vaccine ’ s efficacy in the age cohort of > 65 appears to be slightly lower , at 86.4 % . there were no significant differences in efficacy across ethnic and racial groups . the phase 3 cove trial was selected for cohorts that have risk factors to severe covid_19 infection such as chronic lung disease , cardiac disease , severe obesity , liver disease , or infec _ tion with human immunodeficiency virus . the trial enrolled 30,240 volunteers . participants were randomly assigned to either the control group or to receive two doses of mrna_ 1273 . symptomatic illness was confirmed in 185 participants in the control group , whereas it was confirmed in 11 participants in the vaccinated group . vaccine efficacy was 94.1 % in this study . serious adverse_effects were rare , with incidence being similar in both the control and vaccinated group . overall , the cove trial provides evidence of efficacy among adult trial participants against covid_19.31 effectiveness against multiple genetic variants of sars__cov_2 recent reports about variants in the united_kingdom ( b.1.1.7 lineage ) and in south africa ( b.1.351 lineage ) raised concerns about these new variants evading the moderna vaccine.32 this led moderna researchers to investigate the efficacy of the vac__cine against new variants . serum neutralizing activity was evaluated against the b.1.1.7 and b.1.351 variants . results indicate that the vaccine maintains its neutralizing activity against the b.1.1.7 variant . however , a decrease in titers of neutralizing_antibodies was reported against the b.1.351 var_ iant . protection against the b.1.351 variant by the moderna mrna vaccine remains to be seen.32 efficacy of moderna vaccine on b.1.617.2 ( delta ) strain there are currently limited studies on the effectiveness of the moderna vaccine against the delta lineage of sars_cov_2 . one published study found that the delta strain is 6.8_fold more resistant to neutralization by sera from individuals who have received both doses of the vaccine . overall , all vaccinated individuals were able to neutralize the delta strain by the time of the conclusion of the study . further studies investigating the effectiveness of the moderna vaccine on the delta and other emerging strains will be beneficial for the vaccine manufacturer.33 a study performed by the mayo clinic health system investigated the efficacy of the moderna vaccine against the delta variant . this study was conducted from january to july 2021 , in which individuals infected with the delta variant in geographic areas that mayo clinic locations covered increased sevenfold . the study , which has not been peer_reviewed at this time , suggests that the moderna vaccine efficacy against the delta variant is 76.0 % . despite reduced efficacy against acquiring infection , the vaccine is maintaining 90.0–95.0 % efficacy against hospitalization and death across all publicly available studies.34 safety profile : side_effects and contraindications the safety profile of the moderna vaccine was and is continu _ ously being assessed by monitoring local and systemic adverse_events for 7 days after each injection , adverse_reactions 28 days after each reaction , and adverse_reactions leading to disconti _ nuation from a dose . medically related adverse_effects will continue to be monitored through day 759 . local adverse_effects were identified as pain , erythema , swelling , and lympha _ denopathy . systemic adverse_effects were identified as fever , headache , fatigue , myalgia , arthralgia , nausea/vomiting , and chills.31 as per study results , local adverse_events at the injec _ tion site occurred significantly more frequently in the mrna group compared to the placebo group . similarly , systemic adverse_events occurred more frequently in the mrna group after dose 1 and dose 2 when compared to the placebo group . moderate_to_severe systemic side_effects such as fever , myalgia , and arthralgia were noted in about 50.0 % of study participants in the mrna vaccine group after the second dose . however , these systemic side_effects were resolved within day 2 after receiving the vaccine . a severe or immediate allergic_reaction such as urticaria , lymphedema , respiratory_distress , or anaphylaxis after a pre_ vious dose or to an mrna component of the moderna vaccine serves as a contraindication.31 adverse_effects of the second dose of the moderna vaccine are contrasted between the two age_groups shown in table 3 . these adverse_effects include local and immediate reactions , including injection_site pain , erythema , swelling , and systemic adverse_effects including headache , fatigue , myalgia , nausea , and fever.20 administration the moderna vaccine is administered through an intramuscu _ lar ( im ) injection in the deltoid muscle . the dosage per injec _ tion is 0.5 ml and is scheduled as a 2_dose series separated by 28 days . each vial contains 10 doses , and it is imperative to not mix with a diluent or combine residual vaccine from different vials . the vaccine must be initially delivered in a freezer or refrigerator at a temperature between −13 and 5°f . vaccine vials then may be stored in a refrigerator at a temperature between 36 and 46°f for up to 30 days before the vials are punctured . unpunctured vials may be held at room tempera _ ture between 46 and 77°f for up to 12 hours.35 ingredients include mrna , lipids , tromethamine , acetic acid , sodium acet_ ate trihydrate , and sucrose.35e2002083_6 r. patel et al . johnson_&_johnson sars_cov_2 vaccine development the emergence of the novel coronavirus disease prompted a rapid response from major pharmaceutical companies . johnson_&_johnson pledged over $ 1 billion toward the develop _ ment of a vaccine in conjunction with the biomedical advanced research and development and the u.s. department of health and human science . on march 30 , 2020 , a lead vaccine candi _ date was announced . the vaccine was designed with advac technology previously used by johnson_&_johnson for the devel _ opment of an ebola vaccine during the west_africa ebola epidemic.36 in july 2020 , phase i and ii trials were combined as part of an accelerated vaccine development timeline to assess vaccine safety and determine the appropriate dosage with parti _ cipants from the united_states and belgium . after phase i/iia trials were completed , phase_iii officially started september 27 , 2020 , with 44,325 participants from several countries , including the u.s. , brazil , and south africa . preliminary outcomes to determine the efficacy of the vaccine have been published as of february 9 , 2021 , with researchers evaluating the prevalence of moderate and severe infection after 14 and 28 days of vaccine administration.37 after preliminary phase_iii results were released , the u.s. food and drug administration unanimously approved an emergency_use_authorization for the johnson_&_johnson vaccine to be used in the united_states . this would be the third vaccine approved for use in the u.s. , following the pfizer and moderna two_dose regimen vaccines . as of may 2021 , the johnson_&_johnson vaccine is being manufactured on a wide scale and doses are being administered to eligible individuals.38 globally , the johnson_&_johnson vaccine has also been approved for use . south africa began the administration of the vaccine on february 17 , 2021 . south africa approved the johnson_&_johnson vaccine earlier due to the emergence of a more contagious variant of covid_19 , the south african variant 501.v2 . the south african government initially had purchased astrozeneca ’ s vaccine , but early trials showed that the astrazeneca vaccine did not provide the same level of protection against mild , moderate , and severe coronavirus infection that the johnson_&_johnson vaccine did . key aspects of the johnson_&_johnson vaccine that allowed for its rapid approval were that it is only required as a single_dose and could be stored at higher temperatures than its competitors , allowing for easier implementation in rural and underdeveloped com _ munities that do not have access to the freezers and technology required to store mrna vaccines.39 bahrain was the next country to authorize its use on february 25 , 2021 , approving vaccination for individuals 65 or older and those with preexist _ ing conditions.40 johnson_&_johnson officially announced a lead candidate for their vaccine using an adenovirus vector . phase 1 and 2 started in july 20202 and were combined to determine safety and dosage in the united_states and belgium . phase 3 started september 7 , 2020 , with the goal of determining vaccine effi_ cacy . phase 3 was the ensemble trial and approximately 44,000 individuals participated . in february 2021 , the u.s. fda issued an emergency_use_authorization of the johnson_&_johnson and vaccine administration began , with this timeline being shown graphically in figure 3.22 table 4 summarizes the key clinical_trials for the pfizer , moderna , and johnson_&_johnson vaccines and includes the timeline for phase 3 clinical_trials and the approval of an emergency_use_authorization for each vaccine by the us food and drug administration . mechanism of action the johnson_&_johnson ( janssen ) vaccine is a product of a recombination and replication_incompetent human adeno _ virus type 26 vector that expresses the sars_cov_2 spike antigen . the adenovirus is normally responsible for symptoms similar to the common_cold and serves as the viral vector . adenovirus type 26 is a naturally occurring virus and occurs in low prevalence in humans . without replication , the virus is unable to propagate within its host . a replication gene is deleted in the vaccine , so it is incapable of replicating within humans and causing infection . as a result , it is an appropriate method to deliver genetic material encoding the spike antigen into human cells . the spike ( s ) antigen is what is responsible for the immune protection offered by the vaccination . protective antibodies are produced and protected from future infection.28 an immune response is mounted against the s antigen and results in a vaccine_induced antibody response against the spike_protein in sars_cov_2.41 table 3 . tolerability and systemic

age of 18 were included , and outcomes will be measured span _ ning 2 years . researchers are evaluating the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing moderate and severe infections . moderate infection is defined as a respiratory_rate less than or equal to 20 breaths per minute , pneumonia , short _ ness of breath , difficulty breathing , fever , sore_throat , and chills . severe infection is defined as respiratory_failure , presence of shock , intensive_care_unit admission , organ failure , and death.37 for protection against moderate infection , efficacy was 66.9 % 14 days after vaccination and 66.1 % 28 days after vaccination . against severe infection , efficacy was 76.7 % 14 days after vaccina _ tion and 85.4 % 28 days after vaccination . primary outcomes were released on january 5 , 2021 , and there were no covid_19 asso_ ciated hospitalizations or deaths in participants who received the johnson_&_johnson vaccine . researchers also found no differences in safety and efficacy in different age_groups.36 primary vaccine trial data from ensemble showed that vac__cine was approximately 66.0 % effective in the prevention of moderate infection 14 and 28 days after vaccine administration . the vaccine was approximately 80.0 % effective in preventing severe infection 14 and 28 days after vaccine administration.43 preclinical stage•january 2020 : johnson_&_johnson

2021.e2002083_8 r. patel et al . in the phase_iii study , 39,321 participants were given the johnson and johnson vaccine or a placebo in an international , randomized , and double_blind trial . the study assessed preven _ tion of moderate_to_severe infection within 14 and 28 days of vaccine administration . within 14 days , there was 66.9 % efficacy in preventing moderate infection and 66.1 % efficacy within 28 days . protection against critical infection was 76.7 % within 14 days and 85.4 % within 28 days.44 these results show that the vaccine is effective in preventing the most serious outcomes , which are admission into the icu and death.45 this is important because the onset of coronavirus pandemic had overwhelmed hospitals globally . preventing moderate and severe infections would reduce the number of hospitalizations and reduce the burden of covid_19 on the healthcare infrastructure . effectiveness against multiple genetic variants of sars__cov_2 the johnson_&_johnson phase 3 trial occurred later than moderna ’ s and pfizer ’ s . as a result , results were able to evaluate the efficacy of the vaccine to new variants of sars_cov_2 . in south africa , a new and more contagious variant entitled 501y . v2 has been discovered . 501y.v2 is a variant of the b.1.351 lineage . in the ensemble study by johnson_&_johnson , various strains were identified in covid_19 positive participants . in the united_states , 96.4 % of covid_19 infections were due to the original wuhan_h1 variant d614g . in brazil , 69.4 % were from the p.2 lineage and 30.6 % were due to wuhan_h1 d614g . in south africa , 94.5 % of variants identified were 501y.v2 . these results show the evolution of the pandemic due to multiple genetic variants and the necessity of emerging vaccines to be effective against different variants . in the us and brazil , efficacy was similar to the initial study at approximately 66.0 % against moderate infection and 80.0 % against severe infection . however , the vaccine efficacy on the south african variant was only 52.0 % after 14 days and 73.1 % after 14 days . for severe infection , efficacy was 64.0 % after 14 days and 81.7 % after 28 days . these results are important as south africa has adjusted their vaccine implementation and focus toward the johnson_&_johnson vaccine to combat the 501y.v2 variant.43 in terms of neutralizing_antibodies and immunogenicity of the vaccine , preliminary studies by johnson_&_johnson show there is a 1.6_fold reduction in neutralizing_antibodies to the delta variant , but there is still strong evidence the vaccine can prevent hospitalization and death , which are the most impor _ tant goals of vaccination.46,47 these preliminary studies cur_ rently show that the single_dose vaccine efficacy is high in preventing mortality due to the delta variant despite lower neutralizing_antibody levels . safety profile : side_effects and contraindications contraindications to the johnson_&_johnson vaccine include individuals with a known history of a severe allergic_reaction to the ingredients of the vaccine . there is not enough data to guide the administration of the vaccine to pregnant women.48 local adverse_reactions were measured in a cohort of vac__cine recipients , with 2,036 individuals ages 18 to 59 and 1,320 individuals ages 60 and above . table 5 shows the prevalence of local adverse_reactions and whether mild symptoms were experienced or severe symptoms were expressed in each age_group . in this group , only one serious adverse_event was recorded , with one patient experiencing a hypersensitivity reaction to the vaccine , resulting in facial swelling with no other debilitating symptoms.49 the most common side effect was injection_site pain . thrombotic events were also studied in vaccine recipients . there were six thrombotic events recorded , occurring as a deep_vein_thrombosis . however , further analysis suggested that these events were not related to the johnson_&_johnson vaccine.36 adverse_effects experienced by recipients of the johnson_&_johnson vaccine are listed in table 5 , with the majority of individuals aged over 18 experiencing local and immedi _ ate reactions such as injection_site pain , erythema , swelling , and systemic_reactions including headache , fever , fatigue , and myalgia . these symptoms were reported to be mild in most participants , with less than 1 % of the cohort experi _ encing debilitating symptoms that impeded the ability to carry out daily tasks or required hospitalization.23 additional serious aes have also occurred . the fda has issued changes to the eua fact sheet warning of the poten _ tial but rare risk of guillain_barré syndrome ( gbs ) and thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome ( tts ) . in the us , as of september 15 , 2021 , over 15 million_doses have been administered , and there have only been 47 con_ firmed cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syn_ drome . this is a rare occurrence noted in women under the age of 50 . relative to the mrna vaccines , significant table 5 . tolerability and systemic adverse_effects experienced

developing myocarditis has not been reported.50 guillain_barré syndrome ( gbs ) is a neurological_disorder that has been reported as a post_vaccine complication of the johnson_&_johnson vaccine . according to the cdc vaccine adverse_events reporting system , 7.8 gbs cases per million vaccine doses were found in males and females . similar to the myocarditis risk seen in mrna vaccines , the cdc determined the possible benefits of the vaccine in preventing hospitalization and mortality was more signifi _ cant than the risk of developing tts or gbs.51 johnson_&_johnson vaccine administration halt in the united_states on april 13 , 2021 , the administration of the johnson_&_johnson vaccine was halted due to the incidence of cerebral venous sinus thromboses ( cvst ) . there were six reported cases , all women ages 18 to 48 , and all had received the johnson_&_johnson vaccine 6 to 13 days before the onset of cvst symptoms . the fda advised a halt in vaccine administration while also assuring that this was an extre _ mely rare occurrence as over 7 million_doses had already been administered in the united_states . johnson_&_johnson vaccine administration was paused until april 23 after the fda and cdc analyzed whether the vaccine did increase the risk for thromboses and other blood disorders and will continue to monitor adverse_events . the fda and cdc concluded that the vaccine is safe and effective , with the risk of cvst and thrombosis_thrombocytopenia syndrome being determined to be extremely low relative to the ben_ efits of receiving the vaccine.52 administration the key difference between the johnson_&_johnson vaccine from others currently being used is that it is delivered as a single dose . administration occurs through an intramuscular ( im ) injection at a dose of 0.5 ml . each vial contains approxi _ mately 5 doses.51 vaccine vials can also be stored in refrigerators at higher temperatures , unlike the pfizer and moderna vaccines . punctured multi_dose vials are stored at 36 to 46°f and unpunctured vials can be stored at 47 to 77°f for up to 12 hours . after the first puncture of the vial , it should be stored at 36 to 46°f for up to 6 hours or at room_temperature , 77°f , for up to 2 hours . vials should be thrown away if they are not used within this window.51 the vaccine ingredients are com _ posed of citric acid monohydrate , trisodium citrate dihydrate , ethanol , 2_hydroxypropyl_β_cyclodextrin , polysorbate_80 , and sodium chloride . no preservatives , eggs , or latex have been added to the formulation.51 conclusion throughout this article , data including the efficacy , mechanism of action , administration , safety , and development of the three vaccines currently in use in the us were reviewed and sum _ marized . pfizer and moderna shared many commonalities including efficacy , with both companies demonstrating the efficacy of approximately 95.0 % in preventing infection during early clinical_trials . mechanisms of actions and administration were also a common point , with both companies delivering two separate doses of mrna vaccines to develop an immune response . the johnson and johnson vaccine was shown to have significantly lower efficacy than both pfizer and moderna in preventing infection with approximately 66.0 % efficacy . the johnson and johnson vaccine also differed from pfizer and moderna in that it did not utilize mrna technology , rather involving the single_dose administration of a mutated adeno _ virus to replicate an immune response to the virus . the efficacy of all three vaccines against variants , especially the emerging variant must be a topic of further research , as it could elucidate a need for additional dose administration . all three vaccines have very high effectiveness in preventing hospitalization and death , which are the most important goals of vaccination . the swift response of pharmaceutical companies to the covid_19 pandemic can not be undermined and as vaccine distribution increases globally , the fight against a virus that has taken nearly millions of lives looks to finally be tilting in humanity ’ s favor .

quote or distribute without permission . abstract many studies report that t he pfizer _biontech ( bnt162b2 ) and moderna ( mrna1273 ) covid__19 vaccines provid e similar protection against mortality , with a modest edge for moderna due to slowe r waning . however , most comparisons of pfizer to moderna , or of either vaccine to the unvaccinated , do not address selection_effects for who gets vaccinated , with how many doses , when , and with which vaccine . the researchers report evidence on large selection_effects and use a novel method to control for these effects . instead of studying covid__19 mortality , they study the covid__19 excess mortality percentage ( cemp ) , defined as covid__19 deaths divided by non _covid natural_deaths for the same population . the cemp measure uses non__covid _19 natural_deaths as a prox y for population health and thus controls , albeit imperfectly , for selection_effects . the authors report mortality risk ( rmr ) for each vaccine relative to the unvaccinated and to the other vaccine , using linked mortality and vaccination records for all adults in milwaukee county , wisconsin , through june 30 , 2022 . both vaccines provided similar protection for persons aged 18_ 59 . however , for persons aged 60+ , rmrs for two _dose pfizer vaccinees were consi stently over twice those for moderna . pfizer two_dose rmr for ages 60+ over april 2021– june 2022 was 248 % of moderna [ 95 % ci=175 % , 353 % ] . in the omicron_period , pfizer rmr was 57 % versus 23 % for moderna . both vaccines demonstrated waning two _dose effectiveness over time , especially for ages 60+ . a possible explanation for the moderna advantage is a higher dose ( 100 μg versus 30 μg for pfizer ) . for booster recipients , the pfizer _moderna gap is smaller and statistically insignificant . younger persons ( aged 18– 59 ) were well_ protected against death by two doses of either vaccine , and highly protected by three doses ( no deaths among over 100,000 vaccinees ) . these results support booster importance for ages 60+ , especially for pfizer recipients . they suggest , but do not prove , that older persons may benefit from a larger vaccine dose .

covid__19 mortality risk after pfizer vs. moderna vaccination : evidence from linked mortality and vaccination records introduction covid_ 19 vaccines have saved hundreds of thousands of lives in the united_states ( steele 2022 ) and millions worldwide ( watson 2022 ) . conventional_wisdom is that both mrna vaccines , from pfizer_ biontech ( bnt162b2 ) and moderna ( mrna1273 ) , provide strong and similar protection against severe_disease and mortality , with perhaps a nod to moderna , which wane s more slowly . however , these studies rely on observational data , and are vulnerable to selection_effects for who gets vaccinated , with how many doses , and with which vaccine . failure to address selection_effects can lead to biased estimates of vaccine effectiveness ( ve ) and relative mortality risk ( rmr ) for the vaccinated relative to the unvaccinated , and for pfizer versus moderna vaccinees .1 in prior work , we provide evide nce for strong selection_effects in who gets vaccinated : two_dose vaccinees are healthier than the unvaccinated , and three_ dose vaccinees are generally healthier than two _dose vaccinees.2 here , we extend that work and provide evidence for selection_effects in which vaccine people receive . many studies have reported real _world evidence on vaccine effectiveness ( ve ) for the mrna vaccines against infection , hospitalization , and death ( for brevity , we cite principally systematic_reviews ) .3–6 however , m any studies , including those sponsored by the u.s. centers_for_disease_control ( cdc ) . report results for both vaccines together.2,7–12 studies that report vaccine_ specific results have generally suggested a modest advantage for moderna in effectiveness against hospitalization and death . however , most of these studies have limited controls for individual characteristics , often only age and gender ; use research designs that are prone to selection_effects , often a test _negative design , which compares peopl e with positive covid__19 tests to controls who test negative ; and/or cover limited time periods or populations ( e.g. , us veterans . both vaccines use similar mrna technology , but the initial two moderna doses were 100 μg versus 30 μg for pfizer ( the boost er doses are 50 μg for moderna versus 30 μg for pfizer ) . the differing doses reflect each company ’ s decision on balancing the extra immune _system boost from a larger dose versus the risk of side_effects . yet we know from research on vaccines for other respiratory diseases ( influenza , pneumonia ) that ve declines with age among the elderly.13,14 there is also evidence for influenza , that the elderly benefit benefit a larger vaccine dose to compensate for their weaker immune systems.13–17 this pattern could plausibly hold for the covid_ 19 vaccines . in our prior work , w e propose , validate , and use a novel approach for addressing selection when studying covid__19 mortality risk .1,2,18 we use the non_ covid_ 19 natural_mortality rate ( non _covi d_nmr ) as a proxy for unobserved health and thus background mortality risk , within a population defined by age , gender , vaccination status , and other characteristics . we and use a related measure , the covid_ 19 excess mortality percentage ( cemp ) ( defined as the covid__19 mortality_rate divided by non_ covid_ nmr ) as an outcome for studying ve and rmr . this measure is available on a population wide basis and performs well in predicting covid__19 mortality for unvaccinated populations . in this study , we use the cemp measure to assess rmrs for pfizer and moderna vaccinee s versus the unvaccinated , and the relative effectiveness of each vaccine . 2 data and methods we study all deaths among adults age 18+ residing in milwaukee county , wisconsin ( milwaukee ) , a racially , ethnically and economically diverse county which includes 722,000 adults , of whom 19,895 died during the covid__19 pandemic period from april 1 , 2020 , through june 30 , 2022 . we use death certificate data , which includes residence zip_code , ag e at death , gender , race/ethnicity , education , income , manner of death , and text fields for cause of death and conditions leading to death . we use text analysis to identify deaths due to covid__19 . our text analysis identifies substantially more covid__19 deaths than do the cause_ of_death codes assigned by the national_center_for_health_statistics ( nchs ) based on the text fields , and reduces misattribution of covid__19 deaths as non__covid deaths . see appendix for details . we exclude j & j vaccinees , vaccinees who received only one dose , and vaccinees who received more than one type of vaccine . we treat vaccination as effective against mortality beginning 30 days after receipt , to allow for time from vaccination to full effectiveness , plus typical lags from infection to death . we study over the vaccine _available period from april 1 , 2021 , through june 30 , 2022 , which includes the first half of 2022 ( 1h _2022 ) , when omicron was the dominant covid__19 variant . we measure ve and rmr for two or three pfizer or moderna doses versus the unvaccinated , and for pfizer versus moderna vaccinees . we define cemp as covid_ 19 deaths/non _covid _19 natural_deaths , converted to a percentage . we measure ve against death , and relative mortality risk ( rmr = 1 –ve ) versus the unvaccinated for combinations of vaccine type , number of doses , and time period . we report results for three time periods : pre _booster period ( april 1_ sept. 30 , 2021 ) , delta period ( october 1_december 31 , 2021 , below “ 4q _2021 ” ) , and omicron_period ( january 1_ june 30 , 2022 ) , but provi de results by calendar quarter in the appendix . we study two_ dose vaccinees in each time period , and three _dose vaccinees beginning 4q _2021 , when booster doses became available . see extended methods in the appendix for formal variable definitions . cemp , rmr , and the p fizer/moderna ratio are all ratios , so will be undefined if the denominator is zero ; this issue did not affect our measures of cemp and rmr versus the unvaccinated , but did prevent us from computing some pfizer/moderna ratios for younger pe rsons , due to no deaths among moderna vaccinees . cemp represents the odds , for a population of interest , of dying from covid__19 versus other natural causes . the ratio of cemps for two groups , such as two_ dose vaccinees versus unvaccinated , or pfizer versus moderna vaccinees , is the rmr for the two groups , and is a lso a n odds_ratio . these odds ratios can be either computed directly or obtained through logistic_regression . we use both approaches . for multivariate logistic_regression analysis of the association between vaccin e type and rmr , the regression predictors are vaccine type ; days since most _recent dose ( minus 30 days ) ; age , age2 , zip_code _level socio _economic status ( zip _ses ) ,19 gender , race/ethnicity ( non_hispanic white ( “ white ” ) versus other ) , and education ( high_ school or less versus some college or more ) . cemp treats non _covid natural_deaths as a proxy for the health of a given group , and thus the likelihood of covid_ 19 mortality if not vaccinated . we assessed the validity of this approach by studying the correlation in wisconsin between natural_mortality in april_ december 201 9 ( pre _ covid ) and covid_ 19 mortality over the same months in 2020 ( appendix figure app_ 4 ) . 3 results study population and evidence on selection_effects in table app_ 2 we provide information on the vaccination and natural_mortality of milwaukee adults during our sample period . of 542,152 adult vaccinees , we excluded 94,221 because they did not receive 2 or 3 pfizer or moderna vaccines , and 5,843 immune _compromised persons . this left a sample of 442,088 pfizer or moderna vaccinees and 179,366 unvaccinated persons . overall , through june 2022 , around 74 % of milwaukee county adults received at least one dose , of whom 82 % received two pfizer or two moderna doses ; of these two _dose vaccinees , 57 % received a third dose of the same vaccine . among mrna vaccine recip ients , 6 6 % received pfizer . only a small percentage of vaccinees received j & j or different vaccine types across doses . of the 1 0,140 deaths of adult milwaukee county residents during our study period , we excluded 1,605 because they involve non_ natural ca uses ( e.g. , suicide , homicide , accidental death ) , 1,064 because they received different vaccine regimens than 2 or 3 doses of pfizer or moderna , and 289 because they involved immune _compromised persons . this left a sample of 8 , 250 natural_deaths . see tables app _2 and table 1 . table 1 provides summary statistics for the sample of 8,250 natural_deaths . there are large differences on various characteristics between the unvaccinated and vaccinated , between pfizer and moderna vaccinees , and between two _dose and three_ dose vaccinees . relative to two _dose recipients t he unvaccinated are younger , much less likely to be white , more likely to be male , and less_educated . relative to two _dose recipients , three_ dose recipients are older , more likely to be white , and better educated . moderna vaccinees are older than pfizer vaccinees and more likely to be white . these differences provide evidence on selection_effects . centrally for this project , for ages 60+ , two_ dose pfizer vaccinees are substantially healthier ( they have lower non_ covid_ nmr ) than two _dose moderna vaccinees , and three_ dose pfizer vaccinees are substantially healthier than three_ dose moderna vaccinees . the pfizer vaccinees also have substantially higher cemp levels . for younger two_ dose vaccinees , age 18 _ 59 , selection_effects are smaller . three_ dose pfizer vaccinees are healthier than three_ dose moderna vaccinees , but there are no covid__19 deaths in either group . we confirm in appendix table app_ 10 the existence of large selection_effects , cont rolling for age . for all ages , vaccinees are substantially healthier ( less likely to die of other natural causes ) than the unvaccinated , and three _dose recipients are healthier than two _dose recipients . for ages 60+ , pfizer vaccinees are much healthier t han moderna vaccinees . for two _dose vaccinees over the full sample period , , non_ covid_ nmr for pfizer vaccinees is 52.6 % of that for moderna ; over the booster _available period . for three_ dose vaccinees over the booster _available period , non_ covid_ nmr for pfizer vaccinees is 56.0 % of that for moderna . two_dose rmr s and pfizer/moderna ratio table 2 reports the number of covid__19 deaths , non_covid _19 natural_deaths , cemp ( the ratio of the two ) , pfizer and moderna rmrs versus the unvaccinated , and the pfizer/ moderna ratio , in groups defined by age range ( 18_39 , 40_ 59 , 60_ 79 , and 80+ ) , number of doses , and vaccine type , for three time periods : pre _booster ( april _september 2021 ) with alpha and delta as the 4 dominant virus variant s ; october _december 2021 ( 4q _2021 ) , with delta dominant but boosters available ; and january _june 2022 ( 1h _2022 ) , with omicron dominant . we present results by period , given evidence from other studies on vaccine waning over time,4,20–22 differences in severity between the delta and omicron variants , and potential differences in rmr between variants . some death counts in individual cells are small , so confidence_intervals for rmr s and pfizer/moderna ratios are wide . for ages 18_ 59 , there were few vaccinee deaths and no evidence of a difference in effectiveness between vaccines . rmr versus unvaccinated persons was near zero for ages 18 _39 , with only one covid_ 19 death among two_ dose recipients . there were no covid_ 19 deaths for ages 40 _49 and 8 for ages 50_ 59 ( 4 pfizer and 4 moderna recipients ) . for ages 60+ , where most covid__19 deaths occur , cemp in the pre_booster pe riod ( 2 q_ 3q_2021 ) , was 3.3 % for two _dose pfizer vaccinees versus 1.4 % for two _dose moderna vaccinees ( pfizer/moderna ratio of 2 29 % ) . in the delta _and_booster period ( 4q _2021 ) , cemp was 12.9 % for two _dose pfizer vaccinees versus 5.4 % for two _dose moderna vaccinees ( pfizer/moderna ratio of 240 % ) . in the omicron _and_booster period ( 1h _2022 ) ) , cem p was 11 . 2 % for two _dose pfizer vaccinees versus 4.4 % for two _dose moderna vaccinees ( pfizer/moderna ratio of 25 4 % ) . all ratios were significantly different from 100 % at the 5 % level or better . for each vaccine , t wo_dose protection for ages 60+ waned duri ng the study period , with rmr s for pfizer two _dose vaccinees versus the unvaccinated rising from 34.9 % in the pre _booster period to 44.1 % in 4q_2021 ; and 55.6 % in the omicron_period . two_ dose rmrs for moderna rose from 1 5.2 % in the pre _booster period to 18.4 % in 4q _2021 and 21.8 % in the omicron_period . however , we can not separate the effects of waning over time from changes in the dominant virus variant or the increasing likelihood of previous infection . three _dose rmr s and pfizer/moderna ratio for ages 18_ 59 , the number of deaths among vaccinees , already small for two_ dose recipients , is zero for our sample for recipients of three doses of either pfizer or moderna . for ages 60+ , a booster dose offered substantial additional protection against death , with broadly similar protection levels for pfizer vs. moderna vaccinees . the rmrs for booster recipients versus the unvaccinated were 13.4 % ( moderna ) vs. 6.3 % ( pfizer ) during 4q _2021 , and 8.7 % ( moderna ) versus 13.1 % ( pfizer ) in 1h _2022 ( differences are not statistically significant ) . figure 1 summarizes in graphical form the principal rmr results for ages 60+ . it shows rmrs points for two_ dose pfizer , two _dose moderna , and during the booster period , three _dose pfizer and three_ dose moderna , all ve rsus the unvaccinated . the upward slopes for two_ dose vaccinees illustrate waning . the gap between the pfizer and moderna lines shows the moderna advantage . the solid lines for three dose recipients are well below the two_ dose lines ; the gap between the two_dose and three _dose lines illustrates the mortality risk reduction from a booster . that reduction is larger for pfizer than for moderna ; reflecting higher pfizer two _dose rmrs but similar three _dose rmrs . 5 multivariate estimates in table 3 , we use a m ultivariate logistic model to predict the pfizer/moder na ratio for two_ and three _dose recipients , for the same sample as in table 2 . because of the small number of vaccinated decedents , especially for ages 18 _59 and three _dose vaccinees , table 3 report s results using limited covariates to preserve regression degrees of freedom : gender , age , age2 , and days since last vaccine dose ( to allow for waning ) . however , point estimates are similar in regressions which also control for race/ethnicity , educ ation , and zip _ses ( appendix table app_ 4 ) . for two _ dose vaccinees aged 60+ , t he pfizer/moderna ratio and ci is 258 % [ ci=182 % ,366 % ’ p < 0.001 ] for the full sample period . subperiod estimates are similar . for three _dose vaccinees over the full booster period the pfizer/moderna ratio was 135 % ( not statistically different from 100 % ) . the similarity between the simpler estimates in table 2 and the multivariate estimates provides further evidence that the cemp denominator does a good job of controlling for population health and thus for covid risk , even without additional covariates . robustness checks the pfizer/moderna ratio for ages 60+ is similar if we do not exclude the immune _ compromised ( table app_ 5 ) or exclude the immune _compromised , defined more broadl y than in the text ( table app _6 ) . results for this ratio are similar for men and women table app_ 7 ) , and for whites versus non_ whites ( table app _8 ) . discussion prior literature comparing pfizer to moderna among other studies of ve against death , some study only a single vaccine type ( e.g. , israeli studies of pfizer ; manufacturer _sponsored studies ) . of those that study both vaccines , many report only combined results rather than vaccine_ specific results .2,7–11,23 among the studies which distinguish between vaccine types , some do not find substantial differences between pfizer and moderna . others find differences , sometimes similar to those report , but do not highlight the m. only one stud y , limited to u.s. veterans , includes the omicron_ dominant period ( only a short part of that period ) , or studies separately three_ dose vaccinees.6 the only other u.s. study that reports rmr using linked population_ wide mortality and vaccination data is robles _fontan et . al ( 2022 ) , who study puerto_rico through mid_ october 2021 ( pre _omicron and pre _booster ) . they report two_dose rmr after 144 days ( longest period considered ) of 14 % for pfizer and 7 % for moderna , versus 3 % and 1 % soon after vaccination.24 they thus find a pfizer/moderna ratio similar to ours , but their abstract states only that “ [ both ] vaccines were highly effective across all age_groups . ” the review by black and thaw ( 2022 ) reports a moderna advantage after waning ( at least 120 days a fter vaccination ) during the delta _dominant period , with midpoint rmr estimates from multiple studies of 13.3 % for pfizer vs. 9.2 % for moderna.4 lytras et . al ( 2022 ) study greece through year _end 2021 , find a nearly 3:1 moderna advantage against mortality , but this result must be extracted from a supplemental figure ; 25 the text ( at 5048 ) reports “ [ o ] nly marginal differences [ between vaccines ] in effectiveness. ” mayr et . al ( 2022 ) report a moderna advantage in reducing hospitalization risk , and an apparent advantage for a combined icu _or_death outcome , but small sample_size “ precluded statistically significant comparisons . ” 26 a study of czechia through november 2021 report s two_dose rmr , 7 _8 months after vaccination , of 17 % for pfizer vs. 12 % 6 for moderna ( 2022 ) .27 oher studies find smaller differences . islam et al . ( 2022 ) study the pre _ booster period ; their outcome is hospitalization or death ; report an insignificant moderna advantage during the first 90 days after vaccination.28 several studies focus on u.s. veterans , and find no significant pfizer _vs_moderna differences.5,6,29,30 two_dose pfizer _vs_moderna rmr s for ages 60+ our analysis can help to reconcile these disparate results . we study cemp as the principal outcome , which controls for selection_effects between pfizer and moderna vaccinees , and study a longer period , including the omicron_ dominant period through june 30 , 2022 . for ages 18_ 59 , we find similar performance for both vaccines . in contr ast , for ages 60+ , w e find substantially higher two_dose rmrs for pfizer versus moderna vaccinees . the pfizer/moderna ratio is at least 2:1 for ages 60+ in each of our three sample time periods . a plausible explanation for pfizer _vs_moderna differences for older people , is that younger people benefit sufficiently from the boost to their immune system provided by two_ doses of either vaccine . beyond some threshold level , which both vaccines achieve , the magnitude of the boost appears to be less important . older people may need a larger dose for full protection ; similar to flu vaccine , for which the recommended dose is 4x higher for ages 60+.31 results for waning and absolute rmr versus unvaccinated for ages 60+ , where most vaccinee deaths occur , both vaccines showed waning over time , although the evidence on waning could be confounded by changes over time in the dominant virus variants , rmr levels versus the unvaccinated are higher for pfizer , but the pfizer /moderna ratios are consistent over our time periods . for two _dose recipients age 60+ , we report substantially higher rmr estimates than most other studies , especially during the omicron_period . during this period , two_ dose rmr versus the unvaccinated is 23 % ( moderna ) and 57 % ( pfizer ) . these estimates likely reflect a combination of continued waning , a higher percentage of previously_infected persons in the population , who have post _infection resistance even if unvaccinated , our use of cemp to control for selection_effects when measur ing covid_ 19 mortality risk , and perhaps changes over time in use of non_ vaccine risk mitigation measures . the value of boosters , especially for pfizer for ages 60+ , a booster dose provides substantial additional reduction in rmr s for both vaccines , especially during the omicron_period . a booster dose reduced pfizer rmr from 57 % to 13 % . a booster dose also reduced rmr for moderna vaccinees , from 23 % to 9 % in 1h _2022 . for three _dose vaccinees , w e did not find s ignificant pfizer vs. moderna differences in rmr . in effect , the third dose allowed pfizer to catch up to moderna . for ages 60+ . our results imply much higher booster value than prior studies , especially for pfi zer . in effect , the higher two _dose rmrs that we find leave more room for boosters to reduce mortality . these large gains are found even though we also find higher three _dose rmrs than prior research . a uk study found 1.3 % rmr for boosted versus unvacci nated for ages 50+ ( when studies report ve , we convert to rmr ) .32 one israeli study finds 10 % rmr for three _ 7 versus _two_doses for ages 50+ ; 33 a second reports three _versus _two_dose rmr of 6.8 % for ages 60+ ; 21 a third reports three _versus _two_dose rmr of 19 % across all ages.34 for ages 18_ 59 , there are few deaths of two _dose vaccinees . a third dose is still valuable for ages 50_ 59 . there was evidence for waning ( higher two_ dose rmr ) in the omicron_period for both vaccines , and thus value from a booster dose . zero deaths among booster recipients aged 18_ 59 through june 2022 is a striking result , which suggests value in a third dose , separated in time from the initial two doses . at the same time , at least through mid _2022 , persons aged 18_ 49 are well protected against death after two doses . limitations this study has important limitations . we study only mortality . results could be different for other measures of severe_disease , such as hospitalization or admission to the icu . however , prior work has found that relative pfizer vs. moderna ve against hospitalization is similar to ve against mortality.1,3 we have data only for milwaukee county . milwaukee county is racially , ethnically , and economically diverse , but may not be representative of other areas . however , the vaccination patterns i n milwaukee county ( appendix table app _2 , figure app_ 3 ) are broadly simil ar to those seen nationally . third , w e rely on non__covid natural_mortality as a surrogate for underlying risk of covid death . t his measure is theoretically attractive . it is conceptually similar to a “ p_value ” that is sometimes computed for all_cause excess mortality ( p = excess mortality as a percentage of expected mortality ) .35,36 non_covid_natural mortality rates in 2019 , prior to covid , strongly predict covid mortality rates in 2020 , when covid vaccines were not available , for population groups defined by age , gender , and race/ethnicity ( appendix figure app _4 ; pearson correlation_coefficient = 0.94 ) . fourth , w e lack data on prior covid__19 infection . especially in the omicron era , whe n many people were already infected , comparison of unvaccinated to vaccinated persons could be affected by differences in the proportion of persons who ha ve some natural resistance , due to prior infection . however , unless prior covid infection is associated with choice of vaccine , which seems unlikely , estimates of th e pfizer/ moderna ratio should still be unbiased . fifth , some deaths due primarily to covid may be coded as non__covid natural_deaths . moreover , covid i nfection predict s higher near_term mortality from other causes.37,38 however , we coded covid deaths based on text fields in death certificates to reduce miscoding ( appendix table 1 ) . t he rate of non__covid natural_mortality during the study period was similar to that predicted by extrapolating natural_mortality rates from the pre_pandemic period ( appendix figure app_2 ) . any miscoding of covid as non__covid deaths will reduce cemp estimates , but we have no reason to expect this to produce bias in the pfizer/moderna ratio . finally , our assessment of underlying health does not control for behavioral differences between the vaccinated and unvaccinated . however , w e have no reason to expect behavioral differences between persons receiving moderna versus pfizer . 8 v. conclusion these results suggest several clinically important points . first , rmr estimate s for persons aged 60+ are much highe r , and therefore ve much less , than previously suggested . moreover , two_ dose rmrs for pfizer recipients aged 60+ are more than double those for moderna recipients . this difference is insignificant for younger persons , and becomes insignificant after a third dose , regardless of age . we thus provide evidence that one covid__19 vaccine does not fit all . the moderna vaccine is preferable to pfizer for ages 60+ , at least until one gets to a booster dose . conversely , younge r persons are well protected by two_ doses of either vaccine , and the lower pfizer dose may have lower risk of side_effects – in particular myocarditis , which is an important side effect for young men , with higher risk for moderna than for pfizer . current u.s. public health messaging does not distinguish between vaccines , and promotes boosters for all . this guidance , our evidence suggests , is too crude . also too crude is the apparent plan by the u.s. food and drug administration to recommend , and perhaps only allow , a single vaccine schedule for all vaccines and all ages . it will be important to monitor differences in eff ectiveness over time to determine if waning of booster protection differs between the two vaccines , to assess effectiveness against new v ariants , and to assess relative effectiveness against hospitalization . data sharing the linked mortality and vaccination data on which this study relies was obtained under a data use agreement with the wisconsin department of health services , and can not be publicly shared . references 1 . patel mm , jackson ml , ferdinands j. postlicensure evaluation of covid__19 vaccines . jama . 2020 ;

distribution chains in several low_ and middle_income_countries are not ade_ quate to facilitate the rapid delivery of high volumes of thermosensitive covid_19 mrna vaccines at the required low and ultra_low temperatures . covid_19 mrna vaccines are currently distributed along with temperature monitoring devices to track and identify deviations from predeﬁned condi_ tions throughout the distribution chain . these temperature readings can feed into computational models to quantify mrna vaccine critical quality_attributes ( cqas ) and the remaining vaccine shelf_life more accurately . here , a kinetic modelling approach is proposed to quantify the stability_related cqas and the remaining shelf_life of mrna vaccines . the cqa and shelf_life values can be computed based on the conditions under which the vaccines have been distributed from the manufacturing facilities via the distribution network to the vaccination centres . this approach helps to quantify the degree to which temperature excursions impact vaccine quality and can also reduce vaccine wastage . in addition , vaccine stock management can be improved due to the information obtained on the remaining shelf_life of mrna vaccines . this model_based quantiﬁcation of mrna vaccine quality and remaining shelf_life can improve the deployment of covid_19 mrna vaccines to low_ and middle_income_countries . keywords : mrna vaccines ; lnp_mrna ; covid_19 ; stability modelling ; quality by design ; stability related cqas ; supply_chain 1 . introduction the detrimental impact of pandemics , such as the covid_19 pandemic , can be reduced by rapidly mass_vaccinating the population against the pandemic pathogen . the successful covid_19 mrna vaccines were developed based on the persistent groundwork laid by devoted scientists such as dr. katalin karik óand many more . however , as of october 2021 , covid_19 vaccines have been administered predominantly in high_ and middle_ income countries , while low_income countries are left behind [ 1 ] . this difference between countries of varying income level is even more pronounced with regards to the use of mrna vaccines [ 1 ] . the deployment of current thermolabile mrna covid_19 vaccines in low_income countries is hindered by the high mrna covid_19 vaccine selling prices . in addition , distribution challenges can also be expected due to the lack of adequate cold_chain infrastructure in low_income countries . these thermolabile covid_19 mrna vaccines require distribution and storage under cold and ultra_cold conditions . however , these cold and ultra_cold chains are prone to faults and failure [ 2–5 ] . cold_chain faults and failures are even more frequent and severe in low_ and middle_income_countries ( lmics ) [ 5–7 ] . moreover , vaccine cold_chain equipment in lmics is frequently exposed to harsh environmental conditions , such as extreme temperatures , high humidity and dust , in addition to occasional substandard installation , intermittent power supply , insufﬁcient maintenance capacity and inadequate pharmaceutics 2022 ,14 , 430. https : //doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics14020430 https : //www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceutics pharmaceutics 2022 ,14 , 430 2 of 15 supplies of replacement/maintenance parts [ 5,7 ] . in fact , according to a joint statement from the world_health_organization ( who ) and the united_nations children ’ s fund ( unicef ) in 55 lmics in 2014 , 20 % of health facilities did not have cold_chain equipment , 14 % had non_functional cold_chain equipment , 41 % had poorly performing equipment , 23 % had outdated cold_chain technologies , while only 2 % had a functional cold_chain with optimal technology [ 5,6 ] . besides lacking the adequate infrastructure and physical equipment , cold_chain failures in lmics can also be attributed to : ( 1 ) information gaps and the lack of ability to manage ﬂawed information , ( 2 ) inadequate training and low knowledge on cold_chain management , ( 3 ) underfunding and understafﬁng , ( 4 ) lack of vigilance , and ( 5 ) failures in decision making , coordination and planning [ 3,8–11 ] . taken together , these issues have led to the wastage of up to 50 % of the vaccines annually [ 12–14 ] . it is possible that the situation has slightly improved in the past few years , however cold_chain issues are likely to cause problems and delays when sending these thermolabile mrna covid_19 vaccines to lmics . given these strict covid_19 mrna vaccine cold_chain requirements ( see section 2 below ) , temperature monitoring devices are included in each vaccine shipment , such as the tagalert temperature monitors which accompany moderna ’ s covid_19 mrna vac__cine [ 15–17 ] and the gps_enabled thermal sensors that monitor pﬁzer ’ s covid_19 mrna vaccine [ 18–20 ] . these devices track the temperature of the vaccines and indicate whether the temperature of the vaccines during distribution was maintained within the range spec_ iﬁed by the vaccine manufacturer . however , these monitoring devices do not provide information about the remaining shelf_life of the vaccine in function of the temperature exposure proﬁles . neither do these monitoring devices assess the status of the vaccine critical quality_attributes ( cqas ) which can be affected during mrna vaccine distribution . however , the temperature reading from these monitoring devices can feed into computa_ tional degradation kinetic models . therefore , modelling of mrna degradation kinetics can be feasible [ 21–25 ] and with further investigation the impact of temperature exposure proﬁles on cqas can be assessed [ 26–28 ] . therefore , here solutions are conceptualised to quantify the impact of the distribution conditions , including temperature excursions , on the remaining shelf_life and on the stability_related cqas of these thermolabile mrna vaccines . the computed values of these stability_related cqas can be used to determine the overall stability and remaining shelf_life of mrna vaccines . the aim of this perspec_ tive study is to propose a new approach for quantifying mrna stability_related cqas and remaining shelf_life based on combining computer models and existing temperature monitoring techniques . 2. mrna vaccine formulations and storage_requirements the active_ingredient or drug substance of moderna ’ s and biontech/pﬁzer ’ s covid_ 19 vaccine is the mrna which encodes the prefusion stabilized full_length spike glycopro_ tein of the wuhan_hu_1 isolate of sars_cov_2 [ 25,29,30 ] . this mrna is single_stranded , 5 ’ _capped and codon optimised . importantly , the uridine nucleosides are replaced by n1_methylpseudouridine nucleosides [ 25,29,30 ] . n1_methylpseudouridine is used because dr. katalin karik óand drew weissman has demonstrated that it reduces the level of the innate immune response and at the same time increases protein translation levels [ 31–33 ] . the moderna mrna_1273 vaccine contains 100 g of mrna per dose , while the bion_ tech/pﬁzer bnt162b2 vaccine contains 30 g of mrna per dose . these mrna molecules are encapsulated into lipid nanoparticles ( lnps ) which are placed in an aqueous cryoprotectant buffer [ 25,29,30 ] . the composition of these two mrna vaccine formulations is shown below in table 1 . the ionisable lipids sm_102 and alc_ 0315 , together with the pegylated lipids alc_0159 and peg2000_dmg are the novel excipients . since the biontech/pﬁzer covid_19 mrna vaccine obtained emergency use authorisation , its formulation buffer has been updated from the old phosphate buffered saline ( pbs ) formulation to the new tris buffer formulation [ 34 ] . the new tris buffer formulation does not contain sodium chloride and potassium chloride , while maintaining pharmaceutics 2022 ,14 , 430 3 of 15 the same target ph of 7.4 [ 34 ] . additionally , this new tris buffer formulation of the biontech/pﬁzer vaccine comes in two formats to be used with or without dilution for administration at the vaccination centres [ 35,36 ] . the vaccine solutions are ﬁlled into borosilicate or aluminosilicate glass multidose vials with bromobutyl or chlorobutyl rubber stoppers and aluminium seals . the new biontech/pﬁzer mrna vaccine that does not require dilution contains 2.25 ml solution intended for 6 doses , with 0.3 ml per dose . on the other hand , the moderna mrna vaccine contains 6.3 ml for 10 doses , with 0.5 ml per dose . these vials are then placed into secondary and tertiary packaging for distribution and low or ultra_low temperatures . table 1 . composition of the moderna and biontech/pﬁzer covid_19 mrna vaccine [ 25,29,30,34–36 ] . componentmoderna covid_19 mrna

distribution of its covid_19 mrna vaccine , pﬁzer has designed special thermal shipping_containers that utilise dry_ice [ 18,20,37 ] . this original pbs for_ mulation of this vaccine requires ultra_cold temperatures of between  90c and 60c , commonly 80c for shipment and longer term storage for up to 6 months , cf . ta_ ble 2 [ 18,20,37,38 ] . alternatively , the pbs formulated biontech/pﬁzer covid_19 mrna vaccine can also be transported between  25c and 15c , commonly 20c , and the unpunctured vials can be stored at this temperature for up to 2 weeks [ 18,20,37,38 ] . transportation of this vaccine between 2c and 8c is also possible , however this should be completed within 12 h [ 18,20,37,38 ] . unpunctured pbs formulated biontech/pﬁzer covid_19 mrna vaccine vials can be kept at 2c and 8c for up to 1 month , however once punctured and mixed with the diluent these vials need to be used within 6 h at room_temperature ( 8c to 25c ) [ 18,20,37,38 ] . once the vaccine is thawed it should not be frozen again and exposure to sunlight should be avoided [ 18,20,37,38 ] . the updated tris formulation of the biontech/pﬁzer covid_19 mrna vaccine has an enhanced stability proﬁle and can be stored for 9 months at  90c to 60c , commonly at 80c . in addi_ tion , this updated formulation can be stored for up to 10 weeks at temperatures between 2c and 8c , commonly at 4c . punctured vials containing the tris formulation of the biontech/pﬁzer mrna vaccine can be kept at temperatures between 2c and 30c for 12 hours , thus doubling the time available for administration compared to the original pbs formulation . pharmaceutics 2022 ,14 , 430 4 of 15 table 2 . storage and transportation condition comparison for the regulatory_approved

storage and transportation . this vaccines is distributed and stored frozen for 6 months at temperatures between  50c and 15c , commonly at  20c [ 4,15,17,39 ] . unpunctured vials may be stored in the refrigerator between 2c to 8cfor up to 30 days and between 8c to 25c for a total of 24 h [ 4,15,17,39 ] . punctured vials may be stored between 2c and 25c for up to 12 h [ 15,17,39 ] . moderna ’ s covid_19 mrna vaccine vials can not be frozen again once thawed , should not be placed on dry_ice and prior puncturing vials should not be exposed to sunlight [ 15,17,39 ] . 3. mrna vaccine instability and stability modelling mrna molecules at neutral or slightly alkaline ph , such as in current mrna vaccine formulations , degrade predominantly via the cleavage of the rna phosphodiester bonds of the rna backbone . this 3 ’ , 5 ’ phosphodiester bond breaks via a transesteriﬁcation reaction due to the close proximity of the adjacent 20_hydroxyl group of the ribose moiety to the phosphorus center [ 21,26,40 ] . this transesteriﬁcation reaction occurs via an s n2 nucleophilic substitution_reaction mechanism , whereby the 20oxygen attacks the adjacent phosphorus center . under alkaline conditions , base catalysis occurs , whereby the 20_ hydroxyl group of the ribose moiety is deprotonated by hydroxide to generate the more nucleophilic 20_oxyanion group [ 21,26,40 ] . as a result of this transesteriﬁcation reaction , a new bond between the 20oxygen and phosphorus is created and the bond between the same phosphorus and 50oxygen of the adjacent ribose is cleaved . thus , the rna backbone is cleaved and two new ends of the rna polymer are created ; one end has a cyclic 20,30_ cyclic phosphate while the other end has a 5 ‘ alkoxide [ 21,26,40 ] . this transesteriﬁcation reaction is also referred to as base_catalyzed hydrolysis or auto_hydrolysis . kinetic models describing mrna degradation have been developed based on ﬁrst_ order kinetics at physiological ph ranges [ 21–23 ] . it was also shown that this mrna degradation reaction follows the arrhenius behavior [ 21,24 ] . recently , moderna also stated that the mrna from their covid_19 vaccine demonstrated arrhenius behavior , with ﬁrst order kinetics [ 25 ] . moreover , the stability proﬁles from this moderna mrna vaccines were shown to be predictable and amenable to modelling [ 25 ] . besides ph , higher order rna structures ( e.g. , secondary structures , tertiary struc_ tures ) can also contribute to the rate of the transesteriﬁcation reaction [ 21,22,26,40 ] . compu_ tational molecular_modelling and molecular_dynamics simulations are being used to predict rna structure . these include various atomistic force ﬁeld methods , broad spectrum of enhanced sampling methods , and coarse_grained modeling [ 22,26,41–50 ] . single stranded pharmaceutics 2022 ,14 , 430 5 of 15 rna is more prone to hydrolysis than double stranded rna , however rnase a enzymes catalyze the cleavage of rna molecules , including double_stranded rna , using acid_base hydrolysis [ 26 ] . thus , it is crucial to prevent the contact or interaction of rnase a with the mrna . the encapsulation of mrna into lnps protects the mrna of current covid_19 vaccines from the action of rnase a enzymes when the vaccine is injected into humans , and the lnps also help the delivery of the rna into the cells [ 25,29 ] . therefore , the colloidal stability of the mrna_lnp complexes is also crucial for the quality , safety and efﬁcacy of mrna vaccines . the lnps are subject to both chemical and physical instability [ 27,28,51 ] . chemical instability can be caused by oxidation , and temperature_ and ph_dependent hydrolysis of the lipids [ 27,28,51 ] . physical instability can occur in the following forms : aggregation , fusion , and leakage of the encapsulated rna [ 27,28,51 ] . however , additional investigation is needed to fully understand the mechanisms of lnp instability [ 27,52 ] . such a detailed mechanistic understanding of lnp instability or the availability of abundant data can support the development of mechanistic or data_driven models , respectively . 4 . quality by design and mrna vaccine stability quality by design ( qbd ) offers a patient centric approach for consistently delivering high quality , safe and effective vaccines based on product and process understanding [ 23,53,54 ] . the critical quality_attributes ( cqas ) of mrna vaccines can change over time and under the influence of factors such as temperature , light and shear stress . when mrna molecules undergo degradation the following cqas can be affected : rna sequence integrity , double_ stranded rna ( dsrna ) content , poly ( a ) tail length , poly ( a ) tail level , 50capped rna percentage and truncated rna content . in addition , the mrna_lnp complexes can also be impacted by the above_mentioned factors and the following mrna_lnp cqas can undergo changes : rna encapsulation , lnp size , lnp polydispersity , and lipid_rna adduct impurities . consequently , alterations of these cqas can impact additional cqas , such as immunogenicity and potency , ultimately leading to changes in product quality , safety and efficacy . the stability of mrna vaccines can be quantified based on quantifying these individual stability related cqas . acceptance criteria or thresholds can be defined for each cqa , and the mrna vaccine can be considered stable and within the shelf_life only if the acceptance criteria for each individual cqa is met . the assessment and measurement of stability_related cqas requires specialised assays and equipment , as shown below in table 3 . therefore , the quantiﬁcation of stability_ related cqas can not be done routinely at the use_point of the vaccine following vaccine distribution . to prevent mrna degradation and alterations in the mrna cqas and mrna_lnp cqas , these vaccines are handled and distributed under well_controlled conditions ( see section 2 ) . this is meant to reduce the impact of factors such as temperature , time , light and shear stress on the stability_related mrna cqas and mrna_lnp cqas . however , vaccine distribution supply_chains in low_income countries can be unreliable as described in the introduction section and consequently these cqa_impacting factors can be less well_controlled . this can lead to deterioration in vaccine quality and loss of vaccine doses . pharmaceutics 2022 ,14 , 430 6 of 15 table 3 . list of mrna_lnp vaccine critical quality_attributes

vaccines are thermolabile and their quality can deteriorate during both manufacturing and distribution [ 25,59,71 ] . vaccines , including mrna vaccines , are manufactured in two main stages , and following this , vaccines are distributed via a network of storage and transportation steps to the vaccination centres [ 59,71–73 ] . the two stages of vaccine manufacturing are the drug substance manufacturing ( primary manufacturing ) and drug product manufacturing ( secondary manufacturing , ﬁll_to_ﬁnish ) [ 59,71,72 ] . these two manufacturing stages generally take place at different locations , often in different countries , thus the vaccine drug substance needs to be stored and transported between these two locations . following ﬁll_to_ﬁnish , the packaged vaccines are stored at the sec_ ondary manufacturing facility and then are transported to the central/national stores . these central/national stores can be in the country of secondary manufacturing , but more commonly vaccines are shipped to a different country . if vaccines are shipped to a different country or continent , airplanes are used for long_distance transportation in combination with road transportation at both ends , from the secondary manufacturing facility to the airport and from the airport to the central/national store . from the national stores , the vaccines are transported usually to several provincial/regional stores , from there to tens to hundreds of district stores and then to generally thousands of hospitals and vaccination centres [ 73–80 ] . this is a 4_tier distribution network , however 3_tier and 5_tier vaccine distribution networks also exist , but these tend to be less common [ 79,80 ] . 6 . a model_based quantiﬁcation of the mrna vaccine shelf_life and stability_related cqas in principle , it is possible to establish mathematical relationships between the cqas of mrna vaccines and the factors or parameters that lead to their alteration during the distribution chain . for example , kinetic equations can be built to describe degradation pharmaceutics 2022 ,14 , 430 7 of 15 reactions in function of time and temperature [ 21–25,81 ] . for this , the following simple kinetic equation can be used to describe the rate of the degradation reaction : rdeg=k [ mrna ] m ( 1 ) where : “ rdeg ” is the reaction rate for the degradation reaction , units depend on the order of reaction “ k ” is the rate constant , its units depend on the order of reaction “ [ mrna ] ” is the concentration of the active , functional process intermediates “ m ” is the order of the reaction . the order of the reaction can be determined experimentally by measuring the reaction rate at two different starting mrna concentrations at a constant temperature [ 82,83 ] . this experiment can be carried out at multiple temperatures to conﬁrm that the order of reaction and reaction mechanism remains the same when measuring the rate at different temperatures . the obtained order of reaction can then be checked by carrying out a degradation experiment at a constant temperature and measuring the concentration of the mrna over time . the shape of the concentration curve in function of time can conﬁrm the order of the reaction [ 82,83 ] . next , the rate constant kcan be determined from the degradation rate law . to relate the reaction rate to temperature , the arrhenius_equation is commonly used [ 84–89 ] : k=a e ea rt ( 2 ) where : “ k ” is the rate constant , units depend on the order of reaction “ a ” is the pre_exponential factor , a constant for each chemical_reaction . according to collision theory , ais the frequency of collisions in the correct orientation . ahas the same unit as k ; “ t ” is the absolute_temperature , in kelvin ; “ r ” is the universal gas constant , can be expressed as 8.3144 j k 1mol 1 ; “ ea ” is the activation_energy for the reaction , expressed in the same units as rt ; to check whether the reaction follows the arrhenius_equation , the arrhenius_equation can be linearised by taking its natural_logarithm . this gives the following equation : lnk= ea r1 t+lna ( 3 ) if the plot of lnkin function of1 tgives a line , that means that the reaction has an arrhenius behaviour . the reaction rate constant kand the temperature tcan be determined experimentally [ 82,83 ] . by plotting lnkin function of1 t , ea rwill be represented by the slope ( gradient ) of the line , whereas lnawill be the intercept . thus , by knowing all the components of the equation , including the universal gas constant r , the equation can now be solved and the activation_energy eaas well as the pre_exponential factor acan be determined . such stability modelling approaches have been already used in the past , predominantly for protein_based biopharmaceuticals and conventional ( non mrna ) vaccines [ 81,84,90 ] . it was also demonstrated that the mrna degradation reaction follows the arrhenius behav_ ior [ 21,24 ] . furthermore , moderna has stated that mrna degradation rate demonstrates arrhenius behaviour with ﬁrst order kinetics [ 25 ] . according to moderna , the mrna stability proﬁles were demonstrated to be predictable and amenable to modelling [ 25 ] . if new data will show that the ﬁrst_order kinetics and the arrhenius_equation will not describe the degradation of mrna vaccines accurately , then alterations to these models can be made , for example by changing the order of the reaction or using a modiﬁed version of the arrhenius_equation . the model structure should be developed by investigating the underlying mechanisms and the kinetics . the possibility of multiple parallel or stepwise pharmaceutics 2022 ,14 , 430 8 of 15 reactions should also be considered . the impact of phase_transitions ( e.g. , solid to liquid ) on the mrna vaccine stability related cqas should also be evaluated . the correct model can in principle quantify the extent of mrna degradation under any combination of time and temperature . following their conception , determination of the appropriate model structure and order of reaction , models need to be calibrated and then validated to make sure that they are realistic . model calibration , or model ﬁtting , implies adjusting the model parameters to the experimental data to optimise the ﬁt between the experimental data , and the model and to maximise the predictive power of the model . model validation entails the use of additional experimental data to check if the model has the desired predictive power . such a model needs to be validated under real_life conditions . for model calibration and validation , two experimental approaches can be used : accelerated stability studies under isothermal conditions and temperature ramping experiments [ 81,90 ] . during accelerated degradation studies under isothermal conditions the degradation reaction is observed at high temperatures . this increases the reaction rate and reduces the experimentation time . for such studies , the mrna is incubated at high temperatures and the change in the concentration of the mrna is measured over time . thus , the reaction rate constant kcan be determined from equation ( 1 ) . by knowing the temperature , the line from equation ( 3 ) can be plotted and from this 2d plot the activation_energy eaas well as the pre_exponential factor acan be determined . therefore , by knowing the degradation rate at various high temperatures and after conﬁrming that the temperature_rate dependency remains valid at different temperatures , the relationship can be extrapolated to determine the degradation rate at low temperatures . on the other hand , during temperature ramping experiments , the temperature is increased either step_wise or continuously at a given heating rate over a deﬁne temperature range . during this experiment , changes in the biophysical properties of the mrna can be assessed by monitoring the degradation extent and/or by monitoring the enthalpy and free energy or another thermodynamic parameter [ 84,91–93 ] . temperature ramping experiments can be carried out within a few hours and this is an advantage compared to accelerated stability studies under isothermal conditions . therefore , temperature ramping experiments are commonly used for biopharmaceutical formulation development and for screening of stabilising conditions [ 84,91–93 ] . the models should also be validated using real_world supply_chain conditions . once such a model will be calibrated and successfully validated , this model will be ready to be applied to compute the stability_related cqas of the mrna vaccine at any possible combinations of temperature and time duration during vaccine distribution , cf . figure 1 . for this , the model will take in measurements from temperature monitoring devices which are already included in each vaccine shipment , i.e. , the tagalert temperature monitors which accompany moderna ’ s covid_19 mrna vaccine [ 15–17 ] and the gps_ enabled thermal sensors that monitor pﬁzer ’ s covid_19 mrna vaccine [ 18–20 ] . the models can also be cloud_based and the information from the temperature monitoring devices can be transferred to the models via the internet . based on these measurements , the calibrated and validated models can compute values of the cqas , such as those shown in table 3 . the model_computed cqa values can be returned via the internet to the computer or mobile device ( e.g. , smartphone ) of the user or vaccinator . a qbd design space can also be established to illustrate the impact of storage and transportation parameters , such as temperature and time , on the individual stability_related cqas [ 23,81 ] . this design space will illustrate the combination of time and temperature that the mrna vaccine can be exposed to in the future . pharmaceutics 2022 ,14 , 430 9 of 15 pharmaceutics 2022 , 14 , x for peer_review 9 of 15 such as temperature and time , on the individual stability‐related cqas [ 23,81 ] . this de‐ sign space will illustrate the combination of time and temperature that the mrna vaccine can be exposed to in the future . figure 1 . illustration of the proposed model‐based quantification of mrna vaccine sta‐ bility related cqas and remaining shelf_life . the temperature of covid‐19 mrna vac‐ cines is currently monitored throughout the distribution chain . models can be devel‐ oped , calibrated , validated and implemented to compute the values of stability related cqas based on temperature and time measurements . these models can be cloud based and they could receive the data via the internet . after the results have been computed these can be returned to the user ’ s computer or mobile device ( e.g. , smartphone ) . these results will contain the quantitative values for each cqa and also the remaining shelf_life . these models can also compute the remaining shelf_life of vaccines by quantifying how high above the allowable threshold the cqa values are and therefore are able to predict when these cqas would go outside of the acceptable limits . this will help to bet‐ ter understand which vaccines are usable even if the cold_chain was partially compro‐ mised and if temperature excursions occurred . therefore , this model‐based stability quan‐ tification can reduce vaccine wastage while still guaranteeing that the vaccines are effec‐ tive and safe to use . moreover , by knowing the remaining vaccine shelf‐life , the vaccine stocks can also be managed more effectively . these stability qbd models are in principle disease agnostic and can be used to quantify the stability‐related cqas and remaining shelf_life of mrna vaccines against a wide range of diseases beyond covid‐19 . if the mrna vaccine formulation and length of mrna molecule changes considerably , the models might need to be recalibrated and revalidated or even new model architectures might need to be developed . 7 . remaining challenges and potential solutions as shown above , mrna degradation can be modelled using kinetic equations and this facilitates the quantification of cqas such as rna sequence integrity , truncated rna content , 5′ capped rna percentage , and to some extent poly ( a ) tail length and poly ( a ) tail level . however , values for other cqas can be more challenging to quantify using computational models based on currently available mechanistic understanding and avail‐ able data . these cqas include , double‐stranded rna content , percentage encapsulated rna , lnp polydispersity and lipid‐rna adduct impurities . the double‐stranded rna figure 1 . illustration of the proposed model_based quantiﬁcation of mrna vaccine stability related cqas and remaining shelf_life . the temperature of covid_19 mrna vaccines is currently monitored

the allowable threshold the cqa values are and therefore are able to predict when these cqas would go outside of the acceptable limits . this will help to better understand which vaccines are usable even if the cold_chain was partially compromised and if temperature excursions occurred . therefore , this model_based stability quantiﬁcation can reduce vaccine wastage while still guaranteeing that the vaccines are effective and safe to use . moreover , by knowing the remaining vaccine shelf_life , the vaccine stocks can also be managed more effectively . these stability qbd models are in principle disease agnostic and can be used to quantify the stability_related cqas and remaining shelf_life of mrna vaccines against a wide range of diseases beyond covid_19 . if the mrna vaccine formulation and length of mrna molecule changes considerably , the models might need to be recalibrated and revalidated or even new model architectures might need to be developed . 7 . remaining challenges and potential solutions as shown above , mrna degradation can be modelled using kinetic equations and this facilitates the quantiﬁcation of cqas such as rna sequence integrity , truncated rna content , 50capped rna percentage , and to some extent poly ( a ) tail length and poly ( a ) tail level . however , values for other cqas can be more challenging to quantify using computational models based on currently available mechanistic understanding and avail_ able data . these cqas include , double_stranded rna content , percentage encapsulated rna , lnp polydispersity and lipid_rna adduct impurities . the double_stranded rna content can in principle be modelled by establishing statistical or data_driven relationships between factors such as temperature_time proﬁles and double_stranded rna content based on experimental or real_world data . however , this would require a large amount of data from a wide range of temperature and time conditions . alternatively , in principle , ab pharmaceutics 2022 ,14 , 430 10 of 15 initio molecular_modelling could also be used to predict secondary structures and double stranded rna formation in function of temperature and time proﬁles [ 22,26,41–50,94–96 ] . there is also some degree of sequence ﬂexibility that can be used to control secondary structure_formation , due to the codon redundancy , choice of modiﬁed nucleotides , and changes that can be implemented into the 50utr and 30utr [ 97,98 ] . stability related cqas pertaining to the lnp can also be more challenging to quantify using modelling . thereby , besides statistical and data_driven approaches , models also encompassing chemical and physical degradation pathways can also be evaluated . these models should quantify the oxidation and hydrolysis of lipids , as well as assess lnp aggregation , fusion , leakage of the encapsulated rna , together with biophysical and morphological changes in the lnps [ 27,28,51,52,68,99 ] . moreover , models for reactions between lipids and rna can also be developed to describe the formation of the recently observed lipid_mrna adducts that can occur in mrna vaccine formulations [ 70 ] . if necessary , models can also be developed to quantify the impact of additional factors , such as light and shear stress , on the stability_related cqas . the impact of phase_transitions ( e.g. , solid to liquid ) can also be experimentally assessed and then potentially modelled . finally , the presence of autocatalytic events or other deviations from the model_predicted evolution of the stability_related cqas should also be carefully evaluated as part of the model validation exercise . besides the use of models for better quantifying the remaining shelf_life and the values for the stability_related cqas , an alternative and crucial approach is to increase the thermostability of mrna vaccine formulations . this is indeed a topic of highly active research and it could lead to more thermostable mrna vaccine formulations in the long term [ 100,101 ] . another solution for enabling large scale vaccination programs in lmics is to improve the vaccine distribution cold chains in these countries . however , this is extremely challenging to achieve due to lack of adequate road and electricity infrastructure , lack of suitable cold_chain equipment , shortages of qualiﬁed cold_chain operating and maintaining personnel , and lack of funding . there is also the possibility of using the cold chains from other sectors , such as food , ﬁshery and agricultural sectors to distribute covid_19 mrna vaccines more effectively [ 13 ] . this cross_sectoral use of supply_chains can increase the distribution capacity and to some extent the reliability of cold and ultra_ cold mrna vaccine chains . however , incidents , faults and failures can still occur . taken together these efforts could help with enabling the delivery and usage of vaccines in lmics , once these covid_19 mrna vaccines are made more affordable to lmics . 8 . conclusions current covid_19 mrna vaccines are thermosensitive and need to be distributed via cold or ultra_cold chains to minimise their degradation and change in quality . however , such cold and ultra_cold chains in lmics are often not adequate or are unreliable . covid_ 19 mrna vaccines are currently distributed along with temperature monitoring devices to track and identify deviations from predeﬁned conditions throughout the distribution chain . given the sub_optimal cold_chain infrastructure in lmics , a large proportion of mrna covid_19 vaccines could be wasted due to temperature excursions during the distribution chain . it is not well understood how various temperature excursion proﬁles could impact mrna vaccine cqas and the remaining shelf_life of the mrna vaccines . to address this , a model_based quantiﬁcation of the cqas and consequently the remaining shelf_life is proposed . this can be achievable given that covid_19 mrna vaccine shipments already contain temperature monitoring devices and that moderna has already proposed a model which calculates vaccine degradation in function of time and temperature . in this article , a kinetic model is conceptualised for describing mrna degradation and an approach is presented for implementing this model into the vaccine distribution chain . these models will take in temperature and time readings from the vaccine shipments and can compute the cqas and the remaining shelf_life of mrna vaccines . remaining challenges are also discussed , highlighting potential limitations of such models for quantifying values for pharmaceutics 2022 ,14 , 430 11 of 15 certain stability_related cqas , such as double stranded rna content and lnp_related cqas that can be impacted by temperature . potential modelling approaches are also presented for difﬁcult to quantify cqas alongside additional improvements that could help the deployment of covid_19 mrna vaccines in lmics . the modelling approaches presented here can help to reduce vaccine wastage , help to better manage vaccines stocks , and more accurately quantify vaccine quality when distributing thermolabile mrna vaccines to locations where the cold or ultra_cold chain is sub_optimal . funding : this research is funded by the department of health and social care using uk aid funding and is managed by the

the remarkable impact of mrna vaccines on mitigating disease and improving public health has been amply demonstrated during the covid_19 pandemic . many new mrna_based vaccine and therapeutic candidates are in development , yet the current reality of their stability limitations requires their frozen storage . numer_ ous challenges remain to improve formulated mrna stability and enable refrigerator storage , and this reviewprovides an update on developments to tackle this multi_faceted stability challenge . we describe the chemis_ try underlying mrna degradation during storage and highlight how lipid nanoparticle ( lnp ) formulations are a double_edged sword : while lnps protect mrna against enzymatic degradation , interactions with andbetween lnp excipients introduce additional risks for mrna degradation . we also discuss strategies toimprove mrna stability both as a drug substance ( ds ) and a drug product ( dp ) including the ( 1 ) design of the mrna molecule ( nucleotide selection , primary and secondary structures ) , ( 2 ) physical state of the mrna_lnp complexes , ( 3 ) formulation composition and purity of the components , and ( 4 ) ds and dpmanufacturing processes . finally , we summarize analytical control strategies to monitor and assure the sta_ bility of mrna_based candidates , and advocate for an integrated analytical and

sars_cov_2_infection , mrna_based medicines are now becoming widely studied as pharmaceutical prod_ uct candidates . at present , comirnaty/c210 ( biontech/p ﬁzer ) and spikevax/c210 ( moderna ) are the two key mrna vaccines approved by fda , ema and many other regulatory authorities worldwide . these two mrna vaccines have reached billions of recipients globally as transformative tools in the ﬁght against the covid_19 pandemic . even as sars_cov_2 virus variants evolve , these vaccines continue toreduce the severity of covid_19 disease . moreover , sequence altera_ tions to the in vitro transcribed ( ivt ) mrna molecules employed in these vaccines were recently prepared , clinically studied and approved to better protect against new variants of the sars_cov_2 pathogen.1,2this adaptability illustrates the potential of the ivt mrna technology for use in future vaccines against emerging infec_ tious diseases . beyond vaccines for infectious_diseases , many clinical programs are in progress for cancer immunotherapy or with mrna_ based medicines acting as a therapeutic modality , including mrna as a template for gene editing enzymes.3−5 all these clinical and commercial products based on mrna tech_ nology share the same characteristic of limited stability from a phar_ maceutical perspective . multiple measures must be taken to preserve mrna ( and mrna_lnp particle )

reasons for the choice of these storage and in_use protocols especially in the context of use as a covid_19 vaccine.6−8in this review , we dive deeper into the reasons for this instability with an emphasis on both drug substance ( i.e. , mrna itself ) and the formu_ lated drug product ( e.g. , mrna_lnp complexes ) . we discuss strategies that are currently used , and are emerging , to improve mrna stability under non_frozen conditions , including examination of the mrna molecule ( nucleotide selection , primary and secondary structure ) , the physical state of drug product complex , formulation composition ( i.e. , lipid type and excipient selection ) and the purity of these components , as well as optimizing preparation/manufacturing protocols for ds and dp ( table 1 ) . we also report on ‘ real life ’ experience of the stability of marketed mrna vaccines published in the public domain so far . a brief discussion of packaging is also included , mainly due to the lack of pub_ lished data on this important aspect to date . sensitive and selective analytical techniques are required to mon_ itor the integrity of mrna and mrna_lnp complexes . therefore , a section of this review is devoted to a discussion of the state_of_the_ art analytical toolbox especially in the context of stability_indicating methods . finally , there are two topics that are not covered in this review . first , designing improvements to mrna_lnps for better in vivo performance is not discussed since a large number of articles ( including reviews ) have recently appeared.9−12in contrast , the focus of this review is a topic that has not gained the same attention : the long_term and in_use_stability issues with mrna formulated as drug product . second , only few references to small_interfering_rna ( sirna ) formulation studies are provided due to their limited applicability to mrna formulations . compared to mrna , sirna is a short and uni_ formly structured , and it frequently contains replacements at the 2 ’ _oh on ribose to provide a more chemically stable analog , e.g. , 2 ’ _f or 2 ’ _ome ) . as a result , marketed sirna products can be stored as liq_ uid formulations in a refrigerator , e.g. , onpattro /c210.13 the mrna molecule chemical components of the mrna structure natural and ivt_transcribed mrnas are delicate , high molecular weight ( mw ) , macromolecules that are rich with speci_ﬁc information required for in vivo performance that can be easily lost by chemical degradation along the mrna strand . the primary units of mrna are ribonucleotides , introduced in the ivt reaction as 5 ’ _triphosphate substrates ( fig . 1 ) for the t7 polymerase . as illustrated in fig . 1 , the nucleotides used in ivt mrna include canonical ( a , g , c , u , see fig . 1 ) as well as naturally occurring , modi ﬁed uridines , which reduce theinnate immune stimulation associated with exogenous mrna deliv_ ery.14the n1_me_pseudouridine modi ﬁcation is used in the p ﬁzer and moderna covid_19 vaccines and may play an important role in their ef_ﬁcacy as well . in addition to the antigen coding_sequence and untranslated regions of the mrna primary structure , a 5 ’ _cap structure is also included as an essential termination element that is responsible for binding to ribosomal initiation factors ( fig . 2 ) . this 3 ’ _5 ’ _reversed tri_ phosphate bridged dinucleotide is only present on the 5 ’ _end of the mrna strand ; all other components are 5 ’ _3 ’ _linked ribonucleotides incorporated by the polymerase based on a linearized dna template . while enzymatic cleavage of the 5 ’ _cap of mrna is catalyzed by exo_ nucleases , there is no indication that loss of the 5 ’ _cap is a particular vulnerability in regard to bulk drug substance ( active pharmaceutical ingredient : api ) or ﬁnal drug product stability.15 finally , on the opposite side of the 5 ’ terminal cap structure of m r n at r a n s c r i p t si sap o l y _ a d e n y l a t i o ns e g m e n t ( fig . 2 ) . the so_ called poly_a tail on the 3 ’ end is involved in binding to the ribo_ somal machinery , along with the 5 ’ c a po nt h eo p p o s i t ee n do ft h e mrna , thus creating a closed loop track for ribosomes to traverse during translation of the polypeptide . exonucleases cleave the poly_a tail , which consequently acts as a fuse for translational duration of the mrna . once the poly_a has been clipped to a sub_ stantial degree , the mrna is released from the ribosomes and decays . notwithstanding this enzy matic poly_a degradation path_ way , there is currently no evidence published that the poly_a is a particular challenge for the chemical stability of mrna transcripts in the absence of exonuclease.15,16interestingly , circular rna has recently been advanced as a concept to reduce the exonuclease impact on in vivo stability of mrna transcripts . stability data with circular rnas in pharmaceutical dosage forms have yet to be pub_ lished,17so we focus in this review on the stability of linear mrna transcripts . the simple schematic structure of an mrna strand displayed in fig . 2 belies the pharmaceutical complexity of the api produced from the ivt processes . firstly , the mrna strands are very long , commonly in the range of 1000 nucleotides , and often considerably longer . dur_ ingin vivo translation , protein encoding information in the mrna molecule is in the coding_sequence as a triplet of nucleotides each specifying a single amino_acid in the resulting protein . in this regard , the “ atom ef ﬁciency ” of mrna is low , meaning that for about 990 units of mw of mrna ( i.e. , 3 nucleotides of » 330 g/mol each ) , an amino_acid of » 120 mw is inserted into the growing polypeptide chain . given that the untranslated regions ( utrs ) do not contribute to the decoding activity , the mrna required to encode a given pro_ tein has an order of magnitude larger mw than the resulting transla_ tion product . secondly , and most importantly , the expression of protein and ﬁdelity of the primary structure of the intended protein product are highly dependent on the integrity of the primary struc_ ture of the mrna strand from which it was translated . in summary , the susceptibility of large mrna strands to chemical degradation can be directly linked to loss of in vivo performance . the presence of the 2 ’ _oh on the sugar unit in mrna ( in contrast to dna ) invites the intramolecular catalysis of strand breakage , gen_ erally viaa transesteri ﬁcation reaction ( fig . 3 ) . the 2 ’ _oh is also essential to proper decoding in the ribosomes . as mentioned in the introduction , this requirement for 2 ’ _oh is a major difference between mrna and the sirna therapies , wherein the latter the 2 ’ _position can be modi ﬁed to ﬂuorine or o_methyl with retention of binding af ﬁnity and driving major improvements in inter_residue linkage stability relative to native rna residues . as summarized infig . 1 , mrna from ivt reaction can be produced using either uridine or pseudouridine substrates . although it might be tempting to equate “ modi ﬁed uridine ” mrna with stabilization , this is in fact , not neces_ sarily the case . the result of including n1_me_pseudouridine in placetable 1 summary of different strategies to stabilize pharmaceutical mrna_formulations . stabilizing pharmaceutical

retention of the ribose ring with 2 ’ _oh and an increase in molecular weight ( by adding one methyl per u replacement ) , as well as altering the mrna hydrophobicity . while the effects of base modi_ ﬁcation on mrna stability have yet to be directly compared in the published literature , retention of ribose in modi ﬁed mrna maintains the hydrolytic instability of the polymer chain . rna dinucleotides show subtle dif ferences in intrinsic stability depending on the nucleobases in the dinucleotide.18the mrna mole_ cule , however , is substantially more complex than the dinucleotide set_ ting , given the presence of signi_ﬁcant secondary and tertiary structures . in the following sections , we will discuss the effects of environment , including sequence context and chemical modi ﬁcations , as well as the presence of various formulations , on mrna stability.effect of secondary structure on mrna stability and degradation reactions in aqueous_solution ( e.g. , bulk drug substance ) and in lnp formulations ( i.e. , drug product ) , mrna degradation can proceed via hydrolysis , oxidation , or reaction with adventitious impurities , e.g. , aldehydes , metal ions , peroxides . generally , the degradation rate increases with the chain length of the mrna ; 19this effect can be rationalized by a higher probability of mrna modi ﬁcation as the number of nucleotide linkages available for reaction increases . such statistical factors can only account for part of the mrna reactivity , however , as the mrna sequence and the secondary structure also have a large impact on degradation kinetics . such effects were estab_ lished experimentally years ago , for example , when kinetic data on fig . 1 . overview of the nucleotides found in natural and in vitro transcribed ( ivt ) mrna molecules . while natural mrna contains uridine , ivt mrna instead may contain modi ﬁed pseudouridine to increase the safety and ef_ﬁcacy of mrna vaccines . fig . 2 .

cyclohexylaminoethanesulfonic acid ( ches ) buffer showed greaterthan 100_fold differences between the pseudo_ ﬁrst order rate con_ stants depending on the nature of cleavage sites and poly ( desoxy ) ribonucleotide sequences . 20−24 critical for a successful phospho_diester cleavage and rna strand break formation is a ( near ) in_line orientation of the attack_ ing 2 ’ _hydroxyl group ( nucleophile ) and the 5 ’ _oxyanion leaving_group.22−24the transesteri ﬁcation mechanism summarized in fig . 3 is ubiquitous and completely dependent on the presence of the 2 ’ _oh on the sugar unit in mrna ( absent in dna and sirna_ based products in clinical use ) . in addition , the most favorable con_ ditions for this strand cleavage reaction involve puckering of the ribose to bring the 2 ’ _oh into a ‘ reactive ’ alignment ( in_line orien_ tation ) with the scissile phosphate on the 3 ’ _oxygen . the availabil_ ity of this preferred conformation to facilitate the strand cleavage reaction is expected to be greater when the nucleotides are unstructured and/or outside the context of base_pairing arrange_ ments , which may force relativel y rigid and unreactive conforma_ tions . calculations by guo et al . indicate that while c2 ’ _endo puckering of ribose in rna is slightly disfavored energetically rela_ tive to c3 ’ _endo , the lowering of overall transition_state energies along the reaction path leads to transesteri ﬁcation in phospho_die_ sters with the intermediacy of the c2 ’ _endo ribose conformation.25 flexibility to access the conformational space of ribose is therefore likely a key to enabling transesteri ﬁcation reactions of mrna . locked nucleic_acids ( lnas ) are chemically modi ﬁed bases used for stabilization of oligonucleotide drugs , where the 2 ’ _oxygen is per_ manently locked in the endo_position . however , in this chemical modi ﬁcation the oxygen is an ether , thereby protecting the base against hydrolysis . because a hydroxyl group at the 2 ’ _position is essential for ribosome binding , modi ﬁc a t i o n so nt h i sp o s i t i o n including ether formation are not compatible with translationally functional mrna . evidence for the importance of rna structural features on phos_ pho_diester cleavage is displayed in the crystal structure of the natu_ rally occurring hammerhead ribozyme , an rna motif that catalyzesreversible cleavage and ligation reactions at speci_ﬁc sites in rna . it suggests an interaction between stem ii loop and stem i bulge thatcontrol both the in_line orientation of nucleophile and leaving_group as well as the positions of adjacent nucleotides involved in generalbase and general acid catalysis . 24the loop/bulge interaction of the hammerhead ribozyme is described as “ an intricate network of inter_ helical noncanonical base_pairs and stacks ” . nonetheless , the authors of this review are not aware of an “ accidental ” ribozyme_type struc_ ture in an ivt mrna transcript , wherein the catalysis factor associ_ ated with the intricate folded sequence and reactive site would lead to degradation . if this were to occur , such an unfavorable interaction could likely be designed out by changing the mrna primary sequence , leveraging the degeneracy of the genetic code . as a ﬁnal word of caution , rna structures derived from a crystal structure will not necessarily re ﬂect the dynamics of an rna molecule ’ s structure in solution , where it may change conformations over various time scales.26the recent perspective on rna structure by vicens and kieft discusses structural and conformational properties of rna , offering advice on the judicious use of algorithms for predicting secondary structure . furthermore , the formulation of mrna in lnps may lead to environments and mrna conformations , not observed in aqueous_solution . in turn , that may affect the stability of rna.27 contrary to the structural propensities promoting rna cleavage in the hammerhead ribozyme described above , the design of mrna molecules employed in vaccines or therapeutics could bene ﬁt from inclusion of secondary structure designs restricting the conforma_ tional mobility so that in_line orientation of nucleophile and leaving_group is less probable.28wayment_steele et al . proposed to increase base_pairing to slow the rate of rna cleavage , and employed various secondary structure prediction packages to compute two metrics reﬂecting base_pairing probability within rna : the summed unpaired probability ( sup ) and the average unpaired probability ( aup ) . the aup is derived by normalization of the sup on sequence length , and the value of aup is located between 0 and 1 , where lower values indicate a lower probability of being unpaired and thus corre_ spond to a higher stability of rna towards degradation . through optimization of the aup values for several small rna sequences , a signiﬁcant stabilization towards degradation was achieved . of note , computational in_line probing will not predict the stability of mrnatowards other chemical degradation pathways , which may become more dominant as a result of formulation in lnps . this will be

on mrna stability and degradation reactions interestingly , optimization based on the aup values described above led to different nucleotide sequences compared to those obtained through codon optimization , maximizing the codon adapta_ tion index ( cai ) , or optimization of minimum free energy ( mfe ) . aup optimization also worked for longer mrna , e.g. , the sars cov_2 spike_protein rna , where a two_fold stabilization towards degradation was achieved . however , as a potential drawback the authors recognized that aup optimization would not predict mrna function in vivo including effects on immunogenicity . such biological properties are paramount and would likely be prioritized over chemical stability of an mrna when the biology and chemistry requirements are not met in the same mrna sequence . in a subsequent paper , leppek et al . expanded computational approaches to enable the parallel evalua_ tion of in_cell mrna translation ef ﬁciency , in_cell mrna stability , and in_solution stability ( towards rna cleavage ) through integrated persist_seq technology . further , they developed a method referred to as in_line_seq for high_throughput in_line probing . this methodrevealed that “ linkages 5 ’ of a uridine residue are particularly suscep_ tible to degradation ” , which can be mitigated through substitution by pseudouridine or n 1_methyl_pseudouridine in_cell and potentially also in vivo .29 an alternative approach to pseudouridine substitution is uridine depletion . this method , described by scientists at curevac , comprises of sequence optimization to replace codons with an a or u at the third position , with codons with a g or c at that same position.30,31 these codons , and their corresponding trnas are more abundant in human cells , which is theorized to result in more ef ﬁcient protein production . in addition , the uridine linkages are increasingly suscep_ tible to hydrolysis , so gc replacement also reduces that probability.29 this method is otherwise known as “ g/c content increase ” , which also results in a higher thermodynamic stability of the mrna mole_ cule , which is thought to protect against chemical degradation , a result consistent with the computer simulations described above . because uridines in ivt_produced mrna are known to be immu_ nostimulatory,14it was postulated that this uridine depletion strat_ egy would abolish the need for chemically modi ﬁed bases . unfortunately , results from curevac ’ s phase 2b/3 clinical_trial for the cvncov sars_cov_2 chemically unmodi ﬁed mrna_based vaccine candidate did not justify further development.32instead , focus was placed on the second_generation vaccine candidate cv2cov , that has additional sequence optimizations in the non_coding regions . use of chemically unmodi ﬁed nucleosides was continued.33self_amplifying mrna ( sarna ) vaccines also exclusively contain unmodi ﬁed uri_ dines . the ampli ﬁcation of the antigen coding_sequence depends on the co_expression of an alphavirus_derived replicase . the currently used replicases are not compatible with modi ﬁed bases , but because antigen coding rna strands are de novo synthesized inside the cell , these will contain natural uridines regardless . the ampli ﬁcation/rep_ lication process is known to have an adjuvant effect and sarna is therefore almost exclusively explored for vaccine applications.34,35 optimization of the mrna secondary structure also results in extended protein expression.36mauger et al . separate the effects of codon optimization from pseudouridine substitution and show the effect of c , m 1cand mo5u ( 5_methoxy u ) incorporation in second_ ary structural integrity by optical thermal melting experiments . interestingly , although assumed to have a positive effect in terms of innate immune response evasion , mo5u incorporation had a nega_ tive effect on thermal stability compared to uridine . pseudouridine ( c ) and n1_methyl_pseudouridine ( m1 c ) form more stable base_pairs than uridine , so the rank_ordering of the thermal stability ofidentical sequences with different uridine substitutions is mo5u < u < c < m1c . it was noted , however , that the effect may still be con_ text_dependent , so the effect of base substitution may have a bigger impact on folding energies in one situation than the other . in addi_ tion , it was found that a lower degree of secondary structure in the 50 leader region ( the 50utr and ﬁrst » 10 codons of the coding_sequence ) correlated with higher protein expression , probably because it allows easier access for the ribosome . surprisingly , in the remainder of the mrna coding_sequence and 3 ’ utr , higher degrees of secondary structure correlated with increased expression , for rea_ sons less well understood.36 taken together , these studies demonstrate that a fully intact mrna molecule is a prerequisite for protein expression , and that a higher degree of secondary structure content is a more favorable fea_ ture for protein expression . at the same time , the effect of these structural factors on the pharmaceutical stability of mrna products has not been addressed as yet . interestingly , the same situation is described in a recently published overview on the effects of chemical modi ﬁcations of mrna molecules . it only considers cellular/in vivo performance as leading outcome parameter , and effects of these modi ﬁcations on pharmaceutical properties of mrna , such as storage stability or shelf_life , have not been determined.37 stage_appropriate analytical characterization of mrna drug productsduring development in this section , we focus on the analytical_methods used to assess the stability of mrna and mrna_lnp drug products during their clin_ ical development ( leading towards eventual market approval ) , rather than providing an exhaustive description of all published methods for mrna and lnp characterization . 38the analytical toolbox for mrna and mrna_lnp characterization will evolve during the pro_ gression from pre_clinical development to clinical_trials to regulatory approval and the purpose and requirements will be different for each stage of development . for example , pre_clinical work is focused on characterization of materials , understanding the processes , and development of the analytical_methods themselves , especially for such new and complex drug products as mrna_lnps . during early clinical subsequent stages of development , the purpose of analysis can vary from in_depth characterization of impurities and degrada_ tion products , to monitoring the known and proposed critical quality_attributes ( cqas ) of batches derived from different processes during scale_up . in the late_stage development phase , this emphasis of anal_ ysis will shift to batch release , stability studies and establishment of shelf_lives.39,40regulatory agencies also recognize that during differ_ ent stages of development the depth of product knowledge varies , and thus different quality criteria ( i.e. , speci ﬁcations ) are appropriate for each analytical method . this is commonly referred to as ‘ stage_ appropriate characterization ’ in which all the accumulated experi_ ence from the development stage work should ultimately be the basis for setting the quality criteria for ultimate market approval . the dynamics of this analytical development process are exempli ﬁed in the comirnaty public assessment_report where it is mentioned that during the rolling review of the data , additional characterization data and tests were requested before ﬁnal approval.41 in a recent review , a quality_by_design ( qbd ) framework for future development , design and control of manufacturing processes for mrna and lnp products was proposed . in order to implement this approach , a thorough understanding of process parameters ( critical process parameters , cpps ) , analytical_methods , and critical quality_attributes ( cqas ) is also required.42to ensure rapid regulatory conver_ gence of the currently approved mrna_based covid_19 vaccines , they were developed under a more conventional quality_by_testing para_ digm due to the unprecedented speed with which they were devel_ oped and the fact that these products were “ ﬁrst_in_class ” . the world390 e. oude_blenke et al . / journal of pharmaceutical sciences 112 ( 2023 ) 386 −403 health organization ( who ) expert committee on biological standard_ ization ( ecbs ) hosted several meetings late 2020 to document regula_ tory considerations in the evaluation of the quality , safety and ef_ﬁcacy of mrna_based prophylactic vaccines for infectious_diseases.43initial guidance for mrna vaccines was based on previous guidelines for con_ ventional vaccines , including criteria for the consistency of starting materials and production processes , and evidence for preclinical safety and ef_ﬁcacy . for regulatory considerations speci_ﬁc to this class , the who committee sought input from regulatory authorities from all who regions as well as from expert vaccine developers and manufac_ turers . at that time , mrna vaccines against several other viral patho_ gens had already been tested for safety in clinical_trials.44,45 representatives from biontech , curevac and moderna shared their experiences with manufacturing , quality_control as well as nonclinical and clinical aspects in the development of these clinical candidates . interestingly , it was already ﬂagged at this stage that the storage sta_ bility of these mrna_based candidates is a major challenge , and that the required frozen vaccine cold_chain may be a limitation for use in certain areas of the world . in addition , participants in these discussions acknowledged that early engagement with regulatory agencies and regulatory ﬂexibility were key to the rapid development and approval of the covid_19 vaccines.43,46here , “ regulatory ﬂexibility ” refers to the “ rolling review ” of the data . rolling review is a regulatory emer_ gency tool that allows the applicant to submit sections of its biologic license application ( bla ) or new drug application ( nda ) for review as soon as data become available . in normal circumstances , the regula_ tory review does not begin until the entire application has been com_ pleted and submitted.47 because speci_ﬁc details of bulk and drug product production pro_ cesses vary between manufacturers , and much of this information is currently kept con ﬁdential , the ﬁnal criteria for regulatory approvals were left to be decided by each of the individual national regulatory authorities . for example , the criteria and acceptance ranges for spe_ciﬁc manufacturing steps are not accessible in the public domain and companies often decline to respond in public to such inquires . 48 although the united_states pharmacopeia ( usp ) has recently releaseda draft chapter on analytical procedures for mrna vaccine quality with methods to support the testing of quality_attributes for mrna_ based vaccines , the document does not include any acceptance crite_ ria . in table 2 , analytical_methods for assessment of various quality_attributes of the bulk puri ﬁed mrna drug substance , as proposed by the usp guidance , are listed . 49a similar summary is provided for the formulated mrna drug product in table 3 . in this usp guidance , drug substance ( ds ) refers to the active pharmaceutical ingredient that is tested before being formulated into the drug product ( dp ) . the dp is the ﬁnal dosage_form as it will bestored , shipped and presented to the patient or healthcare profes_ sional . in this case , the dp consists of a lipid nanoparticle formulation containing four lipid excipients , encapsulating the mrna , dispersed in a buffered medium suitable for freezing and for injection . several tests related to mrna purity that are performed on ds are repeated after formulation in the dp , because the formulation process can have an impact on the quality of mrna as well.27additional tests are related to lnp quality and purity of the lipid materials . the attributes in the last rows include standard compendial tests for parenteral products , for example , ph , osmolality , visual appearance and viscos_ ity . the two different analytical packages and moments of assessment also re ﬂect the fact that the ds and dp can be made in different facili_ ties , which means that the ds will be shipped from one place to another and may be stored for an extended period of time . re_testing of the ds therefore may also be required before it is formulated.50,51 while different methods serve different purposes in different stages of development , ultimately analytical development should lead to a speci ﬁcation suitable for batch release and for stability testing of both the ds and dp . the ema ich ( international council for harmoni_ sation of technical requirements for pharmaceuticals for human use ) deﬁnition of stability testing is to provide evidence on how the quality of the drug substance or drug product varies over time , under the inﬂuence of environmental factors such as storage temperature , humidity and light . this should establish a re_test period for the drug substance or a shelf_life for the drug product at the recommended storage conditions . stress_testing of drug substances and/or drug prod_ ucts allows for the identi ﬁcation of degradation products and degrada_ tion pathways , and at the same time , can validate the stability indicating power of the analytical procedure.52to illustrate , endotoxin burden is an important quality attribute to ensure safety . as endotox_ ins are mostly introduced by the starting materials , endotoxin levels are not likely to change over time and measurements are not indica_ tive of the chemical stability of the mrna . as another example , whilerna content is a critical attribute and is typically measured by uv_ spectroscopy , this method is not capable of distinguishing intact rnas from degradation products , so additional assays are needed to monitor rna stability . below , we focus on the stability_indicating methods to monitor structural attributes of mrna and mrna_lnps ( highlighted in bold in tables 2 and3 , respectively ) . rna purity and degradation products fragments , extended strands , and dsrna . a key aspect of chemistry , manufacturing and controls ( cmc ) development for mrna drug products

shown in the schematic outline of an mrna sequence in fig . 2 , the antigen coding_region makes up the largest part of the mrna strand and is the part of the sequence that is translated to the desired protein . therefore , the coding_region needs to be intact and correct , otherwise the desired protein will not be produced . impurities from the synthesis are typically shorter frag_ ments that arise from premature termination in the ivt reaction . occasionally , the produced strands can be extended on the 3 ’ end by a mechanism called self_priming , resulting in strands that are longer than the expected mrna sequence.54another unwanted byproduct of the ivt reaction is double_stranded rna ( dsrna ) that inside a cell can be recognized as a sign of viral invasion and is therefore highly immunogenic.55the levels of these impurities are critical quality_attributes ( cqas ) for the mrna and hence closely monitored during the clinical release process and while testing the stability , as they may affect drug product quality . in tables 2 and3 , analytical tests to monitor these cqas are referred to as mrna sequence identity , mrna sequence con ﬁrmation and mrna purity tests for the ds and dp , respectively . capless and tail_less mrna . other full_length impurities that arise from the synthesis are the cap_less and tailless mrna ; these altered mrnas are also potential degradation products ( fig . 2 ) . the cap_less impurity refers to an mrna without a 5 ’ cap or an analog of the cap and tailless refers to an mrna without the 30_polyadenosine ( poly_a ) tail . both the 5 ’ cap and the poly_a tail are essential for the mrna to be translated into a protein . consequently , an mrna chain without cap and/or tail will be less active or inactive , meaning both theamount of capped mrna and amount of poly_a tail need to be con_ trolled . in addition , the 5 ’ cap is important for the mrna stability , asit protects the mrna from exonuclease degradation . 56during the capping process , the cap part is incorporated into the mrna . the 50_ 50m7gpppg cap , which is referred to as cap 0 , is then further methyl_ ated to produce the cap 1 analog m7gpppg ( 2 ’ _ome ) as shown in fig 2 . the ef ﬁciency of the 5 ’ capping process as well as the level of each cap analog should be included in the analytical control strategy for both ds and dp ( tables 2 and3 ) . rna degradation pathways during manufacturing and storage in addition to impurities formed during synthesis , degradation products formed during manufacturing and storage ( of the ds and the dp ) need to be assessed . while impurities coming from the ds produc_ tion process ( the ivt reaction ) will not likely increase over time , impu_ rities formed by degradation arelikely to increase over time . table 4 summarizes the theoretical degradation pathways for mrna and fig . 4 shows some reaction prone sites on the mrna molecule.57−60 shorter rna fragments are the most probable mrna degradation product formed by hydrolysis of the 3 ’ _5 ’ _phosphate diester bond in the backbone , resulting in cleavage of the chain.61the kinetics of the transesteri ﬁcation reaction are accelerated by alkaline ph and ther_ mal stress . thus , around ph 7 and through storage in a freezer ( _20°c or _70°c ) , the mrna degradation by chain breakage will be mini_ mized . the formation of cap_less and tailless mrna follows the same chemical degradation pattern as for the formation of any other frag_ ment throughout the mrna chain . strand breakage can also be caused by other mechanisms including oxidation ( in presence of per_oxides or by auto_oxidation 62 ) or by enzymatic degradation ( rnases ) . to mitigate such mrna degradation and prevent cleavage by rnases , a drug delivery system to encapsulate the mrna is almost always needed . there is evidence that ‘ naked mrna ’ intradermally injected in human patients leads to translation and in the case of a intrano_ dally injected vaccine , to the desired immune response.63,64but now_ adays , almost all mrna trials use a delivery system to protect the mrna cargo in vivo and facilitate uptake in the target cells following more practical injection routes . currently , the most commonly used delivery system is a lipid nanoparticle ( lnps ) . however , the lipidstable 3 critical quality_attributes and methods of their assessment for mrna_lnp drug

include depurination and deamination ( table 4 ; fig . 4 ) . depurinated or abasic sites of the mrna are degradation products where the backbone and sugar are intact , but the base is lost . these products are formed by hydrolysis at low ph or by oxidation.60this reaction is commonly referred to as depurination because loss of guanine and adenine bases occurs at a much higher rate than depyrimidination . deamination is degradation through hydrolysis of the base , which can happen in acidic condi_ tions . the sugar and base will remain attached , but the reaction will transform cytidine , adenosine and guanosine into uridine , inosine and xanthosine , respectively.66therefore , this degradation pathway can theoretically change the coding_sequence of the mrna , which in turn would lead to amino_acid mutations in the produced protein . when the mrna drug substance or drug product is stored at neutral ph and frozen , degradation caused by depurination and deamination has been found to be of low risk with degradation rates being extremely low ; therefore , no control strategy is required.67,68in con_ trast , oxidation of the bases in the mrna , as caused by oxidation reac_ tions often catalyzed by redox_active metal residues ( iron , copper , etc . ) or promoted by light exposure , are more likely to occur ( table 4 ; fig . 4 ) . these impurities , often associated with the lipids in the lnps , are a potential risk for degradation of the mrna and require analytical control strategies as outlined below . potency/ in vitro expression / biological_activity the chemical degradation pathways of the mrna described above can generally be monitored with physicochemical methods . how_ ever , bioassays will tell the effect of such alterations on biologicalpotency and when the correlation between chemical alterations and biological performance is not yet fully established , such potency tests are expected by most regulatory authorities as described by knezevic et al.44methods to consider for monitoring in vitro potency include cell_free translation of mrna extracted from the dp or transfection of cells in a culture with the dp to con ﬁrm the mrna encodes the desired protein . currently , there is no regulatory convergence yet on how these bioassays are best performed and whether they can ever be fully replaced by physicochemical analytical_methods . mrna purity and degradation products : mrna_lipid adducts as recently pointed out by packer et al. , amino lipids , such as those used in the moderna and p ﬁzer/biontech mrna_lnp covid_ 19 vaccines , are a potential source of reactive electrophilic impurities that can inactivate the mrna.65these reactive impurities are gener_ ated through n_oxidation of the tertiary amine and subsequent hydrolysis leads to generation of secondary amines and reactive alde_ hydes . it was already known that aldehydes can react with dna bases.69,70subsequently , it was shown that aldehydes from the n_ oxide degradation pathway of a representative ionizable lipid can also form covalent mrna_lipid adducts ( fig . 4 ) that correlated nega_ tively with biological performance.65of note , any amino lipid with a tertiary amine is susceptible to n_oxidation . quaternary amines are not susceptible to n_oxidation due to lack of available electron pairs , but their permanent charge may introduce safety risks . it is therefore of great importance to control the conditions in which these electrophilic impurities are formed . this means that all lipid components in an lnp ( including the helper lipids ) have to be evaluated for the risk of inducing reactive lipid impurities that result in mrna_lipid adducts . a test for the amount of mrna_lipid adductstable 4

[ o ] : oxidant . the r ( lipid ) _aldehyde forming the lipid_mrna adduct is the result of lipid oxidation reactions of the ionizable lipid.e . oude_blenke et al . / journal of pharmaceutical sciences 112 ( 2023 ) 386 −403 393 is now expected to be part of the quality_control protocol . this assumption is based on questions to moderna and p ﬁzer by ema about “ lipid_related impurities originating from the degradation of the lnp “ and the data presented in the packer publication.41the amount of mrna_lipid adducts is also expected to increase during long_term_storage and handling of the drug product , and therefore , should be tested in all stability studies for lnp containing drug products . lnp ( lipid ) purity and degradation products : product_related impurities in addition to the active drug substance ( mrna ) , lnps consist of sev_ eral components that can interact with each other and thus can in ﬂuence the overall stability of the drug product . for the lipids , the major degra_ dation pathway is oxidation due to exposure to light , oxygen , metal resi_dues and high temperatures . the two chemical groups that are well_ known as potential substrates for oxidation on the lipids are unsaturated alkyl chains and polyethylene or polypropylene oxide groups . 71,72the lnp formulations used in the moderna and p ﬁzer mrna vaccines do not contain such unsaturated lipids , but the ionizable amino lipid found in the sirna/lnp product onpattro/c210 ( dlin_mc3_dma ) does contain allylic bonds in the tail region , similar to linoleic acid tails . in fact , it was reported that oxidation of this structure does indeed occur.73 as an example of detrimental interactions between the lipid com_ ponents , the peg_lipid ( peg = polyethylene glycol ) is a potential source of hydroperoxides . hydroperoxides are frequently unstable and the decomposition of hydroperoxides can lead to chain reactions that may also catalyze degradation of the ionizable lipid . some of these lipidic degradation products may also react with the mrna , where some lead to formation of covalent mrna_lipid adducts , as described above , or induce other reactions that lead to degradation ofthe mrna . as such , peroxides are a suspected source of degradation that can damage the mrna directly or indirectly . it is therefore of great importance to source high_quality raw materials that are puri_ ﬁed from hydroperoxides and metals.74 in addition , degradation by hydrolysis of lipids containing ester bonds needs to be considered . the key factors that have an effect on hydrolysis are lipid chemical_structure ( sterics and electronics of the ester function ) , ph , temperature and buffer composition . the ﬁrst stage degradation by_products of hydrolyzed phospholipids are single lipid tails with a carboxylic_acid head and single tail residues of the phos_ phate head called lysophospholipids.75the ionizable lipids in the mrna_lnp products contain carboxylic ester bonds and therefore , in theory , are also susceptible to hydrolysis during storage . this degrada_ tion pathway is less relevant for freezer_storage temperatures , but may become a bigger risk when non_frozen storage conditions are used . lipid hydrolysis is expected to have an impact on the structural integ_ rity of the lnp which could in theory lead to a lower potency of the dp . anin vitro expression assay , or bioassay , should be able to detect such changes in potency if these lipid hydrolysis reactions occur . tests and methods typically used for stability assessment of mrna the following section covers the analytical principles used to assess the purity and the stability of the mrna , both in aqueous solu_ tion as a drug substance as well as formulated in ( or extracted from ) the lnp as a drug product . molecular size , physical and chemicalproperties of the mrna pose a signi_ﬁcant analytical challenge . due to the large size of the mrna , the number of negative charges , and the structural similarity of degradation products ( compared to the main component ) , several powerful separation techniques are required to assess the stability . intact mrna is too large for ms detection , there_ fore , any analytical method using ms for characterization requires a digestion step prior to any analysis . consequently , bioinformatics requirements for interpreting ms data increase . a common method to characterize the integrity of the mrna , i.e. , to measure the purity and impurity pro ﬁle , is ip_rplc_uv ( ion_pair reverse_phase liquid chromatography coupled to uv detection ) . 76,49a reversed_phase stationary_phase together with a mobile phase con_ taining ion_pair reagent enables retention and separation of the nega_ tively charged mrna . the separation of fragments with different sizes is based on hydrophobic interaction with the column material . uv detection at 260 nm is employed , as the aforementioned size fig 6 . schematic of ‘ ready_to_use ’ mrna drug product formulations currently marketed versus an approach using ‘ at point of use ’ mrna drug product formulation by employing a ‘ kit_based approach ’ . fig 5 . tris buffer acting as an “ aldehyde sink ” by formation of an imine adduct ( adapted from moderna science and technology day , may 2022 , slide 76 ) 19394 e. oude_blenke et al . / journal of pharmaceutical sciences 112 ( 2023 ) 386 −403 restrictions preclude the use of ms detection . the ip_rplc_uv method needs to be optimized to detect the main degradation products , i.e . the shorter fragments , to ensure the method is stability_indicating . capillary electrophoresis is an orthogonal method to ip_rplc_uv , where the separation is based on size . the separation medium is a low viscosity “ separation gel ” , consisting of polymers such as polyvi_ nylpyrrolidone ( pvp ) and additives , typically glycerol , as viscosity enhancers.49,77,78the polymers form a three_dimensional network that allows the separation based on size . larger molecules tangle up in the polymer network to a greater extent than smaller fragments and thus migrate slower during the electrophoresis process . the quanti ﬁcation of the fragments and intact mrna can be either by uv at 260 nm or ﬂuorescence detection . in the case of using ﬂuorescence detection , an intercalating dye is required to be included in the gel to enable detection.49 an alternative technique for purity measurements for mrna sug_ gested by kanavarioti,76is ion exchange chromatography ( iex ) . in the case of mrna , anion exchange is the chromatographic mode . here the stationary_phase consists of a cationic resin that separates the molecule based on charge . this technique involves high risk for on_column degradation of the mrna analyte . however , since extreme conditions such as high ph and high temperature are required for elution of the mrna from the column . for quantitative assessment of the 5 /c19capping ef ﬁciency and poten_ tial degradation of capped mrna to uncapped mrna , the suggested chromatographic mode is ip_rplc coupled to ms. several publica_ tions demonstrate the possibility to isolate the cap part from the mrna chain by using rnase h digestion.56,79this approach requires a corresponding cap_binding complex that will form a dna_rna hybrid . rnase h then speci ﬁcally cleaves the dna_rna hybrid from the rest of the mrna chain . typically , the size of the cap fragment is around 25 nucleotides , which can be characterised with lc_ms to dis_ tinguish between different cap variants and quantify the level of capped mrna.49,56,79 to control the amount of tailless mrna , ip_rplc_uv can also be used . compared to the method for fragment detection described above , where the separation is size dependent , the tailless impurity method needs to be sequence speci_ﬁc . adding chemical additives to the mobile phase enables separation of chains that are tailless from chains that have an intact poly_a tail , and a quantitative assessment of the tailless impurity is possible.80to characterise the poly_a tail length and distribution , beverly et al . propose ip_rplc coupled to ms using rnase t digestion . in this case , rnase t cleaves the tails from the mrna chain and after isolation by dt magnetic beads , the extracted poly_a tail materials can be analysed further.79,81 finally , the total content of the rna needs to be controlled . for the drug substance this can be measured with uv absorbance readings at 260 nm . in addition , for lnp_based drug products , the encapsulation efﬁciency is a critical quality attribute . for the rna quanti ﬁcation in lnps , the quant_it ribogreen reagent ( thermo ﬁsher ) characteriza_ tion is widely used , because it can differentiate between rna inside and outside the lnp to calculate a percentage encapsulated rna , which is not straightforward with other methods.82 methods for analysis of lipids , lipid impurities and lipid_mrna adducts the fda has published a ‘ guidance for industry for liposome drug products ’ in 201883but a similar document that is directly applicable to rna_lnp drug products is not yet available . prior to the approval of the mrna vaccines , the only documented example was the registra_ tion of onpattro/c210 , t h eﬁrst lnp_sirna product approved.84the major differences between liposomal drug products and rna_lnps ( both sirna and mrna ) are the internal structure of the particle and the complexity of the api . as discussed before , for the mrna_lnp prod_ ucts , analytical_methods related to the possible interaction of the ioniz_ able lipid and the api were requested . in addition , fda and emaguidelines state that for the characterization of novel excipients such as ionizable lipids or novel peg_lipids , the level of detail provided in the submission should be comparable to that for a drug substance.85,86 for determination of the purity and stability of lipids in the lnp , methods based on lc with cad ( charged aerosol detection ) are most common , as the lipid components tend to lack a uv chromophore . chromatographic conditions can be chosen such that the four main lipid components and their degradation products are separated.87 the work by kinsey et al . also includes an example of how stress test_ing , or a forced degradation study could be conducted for the lipid components . for detailed characterization of lipid impurities and lipid degradation products , additional analytical detection techniques based on mass spectrometry are required . 88the identi ﬁcation and quanti ﬁcation of secondary oxidation degradation products of the lipids by lc_ms methods has been described by abeyrathne et al.89 for measurement of hydroperoxide levels in the lipids , methodsbased on iodometric titration , uv spectroscopy , chromatography , among other techniques , have been summarized . 90 methods for the detailed characterization of the proprietary lipid components and their oxidation/degradation products are still emerging . recently , an application note was published describing the use of electron_activated dissociation ( ead ) to distinguish the oxidative impurities from ionizable lipids with great resolution and sensitivity.73 the amount of mrna_lipid adducts in lnp drug products that result from reactive impurities in the ionizable lipid can be measured by rp_ip hplc.65these impurities can not be measured using com_ monly_used kit based capillary electrophoresis methods with ﬂuores_ cence detection . this may be due to interference with the ﬂuorescence derivatization by the lipid covalently bonded to the mrna , or the different nature of the separation mechanism of the mrna_lipid adducts from that of rna fragments and full_length mrna . as described above , conventional rp_hplc is based on hydro_ phobic interactions with the stationary_phase , but the phospho_ diester backbone of the mrna is highly charged , necessitating use of high concentrations of ion pairing salts to neutralize the negative charges . alkylammonium salts were selected to retain selectivity to differences in hydrophobicity due to sequence variation or chemical modi ﬁcations . when ip_rp_hplc was used to analyze mrna extracted from lnps , an additional peak was detected that eluted later than the full_length mrna . this late peak could not be detected by capillary electrophoresis . it was found to be caused by the lipid_ mrna adducts and their presence correlated negatively with the amount of protein produced from the mrna.65as mentioned earlier , a test for these lipid_mrna adducts should now be included in every stability assessment . attributes speci_ﬁc to the lnp formulation this review has largely focused on the stability of the mrna , but as shown in table 3 , there are several quality_attributes to be moni_ tored related to the drug product nanoparticle formulation . first , there is the chemical identity and stability of the lipid excipients which is described above . secondly , there is the physical stability of the nanoparticle that can be monitored by measuring particle size , size distribution ( polydispersity ) and surface_charge , using light scat_tering techniques . changes to these attributes indicate that there is a disintegration or redistribution of the lnp components . the onpattro /c210sirna_lnp product has a shelf_life of 36 months as a liquid formulation stored refrigerated.13this pro ﬁle indicates that particle physical stability is not a major risk when a chemically stable api is used . however , the internal structure of mrna containing particles is different from those containing sirna7and mrna_lnp particles are more likely to disintegrate upon mechanical stress , such as shaking and dropping of vials.91,92another example is the formation of layers of aggregates on ﬁlter surfaces during sterile ﬁltration.93a more in_e. oude_blenke et al . / journal of pharmaceutical sciences 112 ( 2023 ) 386 −403 395 depth description of characterization of the particles can be found in these four publications.27,94−96 can we get rid of the sub_zero cold_chain for long term storage of mrna_products ? what are the options ? stabilizing mrna and mrna formulations in aqueous milieu from the discussion above , it is clear that the major determinants for the stability of the mrna_lnp drug product includes ( 1 ) length of the mrna chain , ( 2 ) the secondary/tertiary structure of the mrna and the mrna_lnp complex , ( 3 ) selection of nucleotides , and ( 4 ) drug product formulation composition including associated impuri_ ties ( e.g. , lipid type and source , excipient type and source , solution ph ) . alishetty et al.97calculated the half_lives of free fluc mrna at room_temperature with an equation published by li and breaker.98 this equation doesn ’ t take secondary structural effects into account . the outcome of the calculation was a lower degradation rate for a free mrna molecule compared to the mrna in two lnp formula_ tions . moreover , a clear degradation rate dependence on the type of ionizable lipid was observed.97these effects could potentially be explained by the formation of stabilizing secondary/tertiary struc_ tures of the free mrna , which are disturbed in the complexationwith lnp , or by local upward ph shifts inside the lnp because of the presence of closely packed cationic lipids or the higher ‘ proton solva_ tion energy ’ . 97,99,100 shortening the mrna chain length may reduce the chance of chain breakage resulting in the inactivation of the mrna . zhao et al . employed a shortened mrna chain length of 1100 nt ( nucleotides ) compared to 4000+ nt for the p ﬁzer bnt162b2 and moderna mrna_ 1273 vaccines , and showed 76 % intact mrna , no change in particle size_polydispersity index or encapsulation ef ﬁciency , and preserved immunogenicity in mice after six months of storage at 2_8 °c.101 the choice of the cationic lipid in ﬂuences lnp_mrna stability as reported by ripoll et al . who used imidazole cationic lipids with a ﬂexi_ ble connection between lipid and headgroup , and they found enhanced stability compared to ‘ reference ’ cationic lipids.102multiprotic cationic lipids reportedly have a similar stabilizing effect.97moreover , the sourcing and associated impurity pro ﬁle of excipients in the formula_ tion has been shown to be critical to ensure mrna integrity on storage . for example , as discussed in detail above , _ cationic lipids used in the mrna products are sensitive to oxidation reactions , followed by hydrolysis and aldehyde formation.65since cholesterol , phospholipids and peg_derivatives may all contain peroxide impurities , attention should be paid to the quality of those lnp constituents.103,104 comirnaty/c210 , the p ﬁzer/biontech covid_19 vaccine , was origi_ nally formulated in a phosphate buffer containing kcl/nacl ( “ purple cap formulation ” ) , which presents major challenges in the freezer due to potential ph shifts during freezing of phosphate buffers in the presence of sodium ions . the formulation was changed to a second_ generation formulation containing tris buffer with the same solution ph ( “ gray cap formulation ” ) .105a prolonged storage time in the refrigerator was granted by regulatory agencies , from up to 1 month , to 10 weeks at refrigerator conditions with retention of the long_stor_ age condition of _80 °c before refrigeration.106,107interestingly , tris buffer was used in moderna ’ s spikevax/c210formulation from the begin_ ning , but it still has a shelf_life of 30 days in the refrigerator . this is explained by the difference in long_term_storage conditions . for spikevax/c210the long_term_storage has always been _20 °c , to facilitate widespread distribution during the pandemic . under these condi_ tions some level of degradation is seen over long periods ( relative to _80 °c ) . therefore the storage period in the refrigerator is not as long as for comirnaty/c210 , which continues to use the _80 °c infrastructure for distribution and long_term_storage . another advantage of tris buffer , apart from being more suitable for freezing of liquid formula_ tions compared with phosphate_buffered saline , is that it reacts withaldehyde impurities and acts as an ‘ aldehyde sink ’ and by that reduces mrna_lipid adduct formation ( fig . 5 ) .19this is an excellent example that the choice of excipients can have a signi_ﬁcant impact on mrna shelf_life . the conclusion of this section is clear on the basis of the present insights : long_term_storage of mrna_lnp drug prod_ ucts in non_frozen condition is not feasible unless the product can be commercialized with a very short shelf_life . stabilizing mrna and mrna formulations by dryingfreeze drying of mrna drug product . given the poor long_term sta_ bility pro ﬁle of mrna or mrna_lnp in aqueous_solution , and the lim_ ited success to improve shelf_life under non_frozen conditions as described above , the pharmaceutical formulation scientist would turn to drying the drug product , and lyophilization is then the logical drying technique to begin with due to its wide use in the pharmaceu_ tical industry . in india , gemcovac tm_19 , a freeze_dried form of an mrna vaccine encoding for the s_protein of sars_cov_2 , is autho_ rized for use.108in addition to the mrna , this formulation consists of dotap ( dioleoyl_3_trimethylammonium propane ) and squalene sta_ bilized with polysorbates , sucrose as lyoprotectant_osmolyte , and cit_ rate buffer . this product can be stored in a refrigerator , but no furtherdetails regarding its stability pro ﬁle could be found in the public domain . the patent literature is a rich source of information for freeze_dry_ ing of mrna formulated in various delivery systems . for example , mrna −protamine complexes were freeze_dried with lyoprotectants such as trehalose . under optimized process conditions , mrna chain integrity and in vivo preservation of activity after prolonged ( 12 months ) storage at 25 °c was claimed . 109−112most subsequent reports of freezing_drying mrna formulations have focused on mrna_lipid complexes , and the number of publications is growing . for example , zhao et al . prepared mrna_lnp with a cationic lipid dif_ ferent from the marketed mrna_covid_19 vaccines.113,114they compared physicochemical parameters , and in vitro andin vivo trans_ lation of luciferase_encoding mrna_lnp before and after different processing , including : freeze_thaw cycles , freezing in liquid nitrogen , and freeze_drying using trehalose , sucrose and mannitol as cryo_/lyo_ protectants . interestingly , they found a discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo performance of the freeze_dried formulation : while no detectable loss of activity was seen in the in vitro read out , a signi ﬁ_ cantly lower translation was observed in vivo . importantly , no such discrepancy was observed with the formulations after freezing and storage of the product in liquid nitrogen . another report on ﬁndings with freeze_dried mrna_lnps was published by ai et al . 2022.114freeze_drying did not affect mrna integrity , led to small increases in particle size , and slight reductions in encapsulation ef ﬁciency . these physicochemical quality_attributes remained stable over 2 weeks . under the chosen conditions , the per_ formance of the freeze_dried/reconstituted material in a number of in vivo preclinical tests showed no difference with the ‘ fresh ’ mrna_ lnp material . no details were provided on the freeze_drying condi_ tions , nor on the chosen formulation such as ph , buffer and lyopro_ tectant . in contrast , a recent publication by muramutsu et al.115 provides detailed information on the formulation ( tris buffer , ph 8 and sucrose plus maltose ) , the freeze_drying protocols , and the stabil_ ity_indicating assays ( for mrna and for the lnp constituents ) . after freeze_drying and reconstitution , full integrity and activity of the mrna_lnp were retained . stability during storage was dependent on the storage temperature over the wide temperatures range chosen i. e. , _80oc , _20 °c , 4oc , 25 °c , 42 °c . these dried formulations showed a signi_ﬁcant improvement in stability over time compared to the moderna and p ﬁzer/biontech covid_19 vaccines , i.e. , weeks compared to hours , respectively , and freeze_drying conditions and lyoprotectants may be further studied to optimize the outcome.115396 e. oude_blenke et al . / journal of pharmaceutical sciences 112 ( 2023 ) 386 −403 so far , no publication has reported on freeze_drying of mrna_lnps after the ﬁrst mixing step with ethanol still in the mrna_lnp disper_ sion . this so_called ‘ alcohol_dilution_lyophilization method ’ , showed success with sirna.116 in a recent study mrna was complexed with dotap_squalene ( cf. , gemcovactm_19 vaccine mentioned above ) using preformed lipid particles ( so_called nanostructured lipid carriers , nlc ) . these com_ plexes were freeze_dried and showed preservation of mrna activity upon reconstitution after storage in the dried state for 21 months at 4 °c . this is another example demonstrating freeze_drying as an option for prolonging shelf_life of formulated mrna under refrigera_ tor conditions.117similar results were reported for different mrna products with the same technology platform by voigt et al.118 dotap_based lipoplexes with mrna were freeze_dried in sucroseand translational activity in terms of protein translation was observed in vitro and in vivo . however , no long_term_storage data were provided to support the authors ’ claim for a prolonged shelf_life at refrigerator temperatures . 119 alternatives to freeze_drying of mrna drug products . large_scale vac__cine freeze_drying operations to ﬁght pandemics are limited in terms of worldwide production capacity , and moreover , require time , energy input and expensive equipment . therefore , other alternative drying technologies have been suggested for mrna formulations . recent reviews provide a comprehensive overview of alternative dry_ ing techniques for vaccines , not speci ﬁcally mrna_vaccines.120,121 most attention was paid to spray_drying and spray freeze_drying . examples in the patent literature report on spray_drying of mrna122 −125or spray_drying and spray freeze_drying,122but so far , no prod_ ucts have been approved using these stabilization approaches . inter_ estingly , although no publications are yet available , there is interest in the future use of microneedle platforms for intradermal ( id ) deliv_ ery of mrna vaccines for future pandemic responses and such dosage forms are often manufactured using evaporative drying.126 assembling formulated mrna drug products ‘ at the point of use ’ using a modular approach there are several other approaches to shorten the supply_chain or to circumvent extended contact of the fragile mrna with the formu_ lation excipients . one way to avoid long distance frozen shipment is to move the entire factory closer to the place where the vaccines will be used . a turn_key example of this approach is biontech ’ s “ bion_ tainer ” , a portable factory , consisting of two modules , one for bulk manufacturing of the ds and one for the dp . fill_and_ ﬁnish will be supported by a local external partner . each module is built up from six standard_size shipping_containers that will be assembled in the country where the factory will be operated , the ﬁrst ones to be deployed in africa.127it is expected that from a regulatory perspec_ tive , products from this facility will be treated the same as those com_ ing from a conventional factory . an alternative solution with a lower technological bar , is to assemble the drug product itself at “ the point of use ” . to this end , mrna drug products can also be considered modular , consisting of the mrna ds and the delivery system for in vivo delivery —the latter being either a lipid_based nanoparticle such as lnps or nlcs or a polymer/protein such as protamine . if one can stabilize the mrna molecule , e.g. , by freeze_drying ( see below ) and design stable deliv_ ery systems in aqueous_solution , then assembling the active drug product ‘ at the point of use ’ may address the stability problem and avoid subzero storage conditions ( see fig . 6 ) . this strategy has been explored by a number of groups and their experience is discussed in the following paragraphs . first , stabilizing the mrna molecule at non_freezing temperatures and then experiences with assembling the product ‘ at the point of use ’ are discussed.drying and stabilizing of the mrna drug substance the availability of a dried mrna molecule stable during long_term 4°c storage would be an important step in developing ‘ at_the_point_of_ use ’ mrna vaccine formulations with , upon reconstitution , in situ complex formation , for example , with lnp , emulsions or protamine solutions . what is generally considered the ﬁrst publication on freeze_ drying of mrna ( as naked nucleic_acid polymer ) appeared in 2007.128 one freeze_drying protocol was employed and only two mrna solu_tions were compared : with water for injection ( wfi ) and with a solu_ tion of the lyoprotectant trehalose . dried samples were stored at _70° c , _20 °c , 4 °c , room_temperature and 37 °c . while trehalose clearly performed better than wfi in stabilizing the mrna during drying and storage , there was clearly room for further improvement . in a 2012 patent ( ‘ background of the invention ’ ) , mutzke discusses the state_of_ the_art of long_term stabilization of nucleic acid_based pharmaceuti_ cals , including mrna . lyophilization is the preferred drying process , and they conclude that among the tested lyoprotectants mannose stood out as most stabilizing . 111in a patent published around the same time , doubts are raised about the possibility to use sugars as lyoprotec_ tants at high nucleic_acid concentrations and it instead reports enhanced stability with lactate when compared to water for injec_ tion.110in another patent , mannose was not recommended to be used in production operations because of its low _unpractical_ glass transi_ tion temperature value ( compared to disaccharides ) of _47°c.109it should be pointed out that mannose , a reducing sugar , is a rich source of aldehyde reactants for the unpaired rna bases , and as such this sugar ( and any other reducing sugar , such as lactose ) should be avoided as an obvious incompatibility with mrna . as an alternative to freeze_drying , spray_drying of mrna has been described . for example , karve et al . demonstrated the stability of spray dried mrna_polymer ( not in lnp ) combinations both after the drying process and after storage at 4°c for 5 months.129in another approach , fabre and co_workers looked at the stability of several mrna molecules in the dried state using an undisclosed stabilization solution for the vacuum drying process at temperatures above 0 °c . they predict very low chain break degradation rates based on extrap_ olation of observed chain break rates at high temperatures using an arrhenius model analysis , a result implying that drying would be a realistic option to improve the stability of mrna products at non_ freezing temperatures . absolute protection from air/humidity is a prerequisite.130in a proof_of_concept study capillary ‑mediated vitri_ ﬁcation of mrna solutions resulted in dried mrna with improved storage stability . no information on the underlying stabilization mechanism has been published yet.131,132 “ mrna printing ” for point of use production of the drug substance an emerging technology that could circumvent frozen storage and shipment of the mrna vaccines is called “ mrna printing ” . this term is used for miniaturized , highly automated mrna manufacturing suites , with the main goal to reduce the footprint of mrna produc_ tion , so it can be deployed in remote locations or within the walls of a hospital pharmacy.133in a hospital setting , this technique could fur_ ther pave the way for personalized medicines , for example , to treat ( ultra ) rare_disease or to produce individualized mrna_cancer vac__cines.134moreover , such an approach could also enable local , larger_ scale production of a mrna ds without the need for shipment or extended cold_storage in locations where maintaining cold_chain operations could be challenging . the company greenlight biosciences is currently preparing for a phase 1 trial in africa , with the ambition to develop a vaccine product that could cost $ 1 per dose . this is a highly innovative ﬁeld that is exploring very different manufacturing technologies to reduce costs , summarized well by shearidan.133for example , curevac has partnered with tesla_grohmann automation to develop a device that is fully automated and uses a dna template that is suspended on magnetic beads , which can be handled by robotse . oude_blenke et al . / journal of pharmaceutical sciences 112 ( 2023 ) 386 −403 397 and allows multiple production rounds using the same starting mate_ rial to reduce costs.133,135greenlight biosciences uses cell_free micro_ bial lysates as a source for the nucleoside monomers and a series of enzymatic reactions to turn them into nucleotides and full_length mrna . time will tell which of these technologies will prove to be competitive from an economic and product quality standpoint , and most importantly , how they will be viewed by regulators for wide_ spread use . regardless of the success of such approaches , they will all ultimately require a formulated mrna drug product to be produced at the point of use , and thus will still need to be assembled into a delivery system prior to administration . examples of approaches to assemble mrna_delivery systems ‘ at the point of use ’ currently , large_scale formulation of lnps containing ionizable lipids requires multiple steps where the lipids in ethanol are mixed with the rna in an acidic aqueous buffer and where the ph is neu_ tralized and the organic solvent is removed . the rna_lnps precipi_ tate into colloidally stable assemblies with the rna incorporated into the lnps . this dp manufacturing process can be performed at_large scale , but requires speci_ﬁc equipment and multiple down_stream processing steps . this complexity is the reason why , up until now , mrna_lnp vaccines are presented as ready_to_use formulations , that are manufactured in a few dedicated factories.39,42,50 a number of groups have explored different approaches to assem_ ble mrna_delivery systems ‘ at the point of use ’ or ‘ at the bedside ’ ( fig . 6 ) . some of these studies utilize permanently cationic lipids , which allow for mixing with the mrna at a ph and in a buffer that is also suitable for injection . for example , in 2014 , brito et al . published results from preclinical immunization studies where mrna binds to positively charged particles of a pre_manufactured dotap/squalene emulsion that enhances the immunological response a 1000_fold compared to ‘ free ’ mrna.136in 2018 , erasmus et al . published a two_ vial approach where they followed a similar route : a replicating mrna encoding zika virus antigens interacts with the surface of pre_ manufactured cationic lipid emulsions containing squalene . this study demonstrated complete protection against a zika virus chal_ lenge in mice.137when opting to use aqueous lipid dispersions , mix_ ing mrna with preformed cationic particles may lead to undesired aggregate formation . to overcome this issue , kurimoto et al . designed short peg_oligorna strands to hybridize with the therapeutic mrna molecule . formation of aggregates upon mixing the mrna with pre_ formulated lnps can be mitigated with this approach.138 point_of_use assembly can also be done with formulations resem_ bling the marketed mrna_lnp vaccines more closely , if the formula_ tion parameters are changed . most importantly , somewhere during the process , the charge on the ionizable lipid needs to be introduced again . for example , kulkarni et al . reported that mixing ‘ empty ’ lnps in acidic aqueous medium and ( primarily ) sirna , leads to formation of complexes that are capable of transfection in vitro . characteriza_ tion of the morphological changes occurring during the interaction between the sirna and ‘ empty ’ preformed vesicles using cryotem demonstrated that particles with similar internal structure as regular lnps can be produced in absence of ethanol and without the need ofspecialized mixing devices . 139,140a similar approach using mrna was described , where empty lnp formulations were dialyzed to neu_ tral ph for storage , and mrna or sarna was later added in acidic buffer for complexation . most probably due to the larger size of the cargoes , here the nucleic_acids were referred to as being on the out_ side of the lnp , contrary to the sirna formulations described earlier . but a comparison of formulations with either externally or internally located sarna resulted in similar protein expression in vivo ( mice ) . a later study with human skin explants showed that externally com_ plexed rna is a viable approach for this application.141,142finally , an example of ‘ point of use mixing ’ actually being applied in the clinic is in biontech ’ s lipo_merit study ( nct02410733 ) . this study was one of the ﬁrst to explore mrna_based cancer immuno_ therapies that are speci_ﬁc to a patient ’ s tumor antigens . the drug product consists of four different mrnas that are complexed to cat_ ionic liposomes . to manufacture and supply gmp grade materials , a kit_based approach was selected , where the mrna and liposomes are manufactured and packed individually as outlined schematically in fig 6 . immediately before injection , mrna is diluted and added to the liposomes . extensive prior optimization and characterization experiments ensure the formation of consistent drug products suit_ able for intravenous administration.143this “ kit approach ” allows for separate storage of the components at different conditions and for different lengths of time , in case of varying shelf lives . it also allows for a modular approach , where liposome and mrna kits can be com_ bined at request for different studies . and ﬁnally , it opens the door for truly individualized therapies , where an ‘ off_the_shelf ’ lipid for_ mulation can be combined with a mrna cocktail that is speci ﬁcally produced for one single patient . here , mrna “ printers ” might be of use as well , so the technologies described in this section will have additional advantages other than shortening the supply_chain and relaxed storage conditions . real_life experience with in_use_stability of mrna_lnps two studies on real_life in_use_stability of mrna_lnp dp have been published . first , the stability of mrna_lnps during storage between being drawn into syringes and being injected was monitored.92the second study looked at the stability of left_over material in vials of comirnaty.91both publications concluded that —within the limits of the analytical techniques at their disposal —only mechanical shear stress caused immediate loss of mrna integrity and aggregation of the lnp_mrna complexes . this means that the mrna_lnps are stable when stored and handled as instructed , but this sensitivity to mechan_ ical stress could have implications for transport as a liquid product . another published example is the technical failure of a freezer in a hospital , which caused a temperature excursion to higher , but still sub_ zero , temperatures for hours for spikevax/c210 . no detectable loss of mrna integrity was observed in an electrophoretic assay.144in a fol_ lowing publication , the authors intentionally thawed and re_froze vials of comirnaty/c210and spikevax/c210and found that mrna integrity ( by elec_ trophoresis ) and immunogenicity in mice were preserved after 1 month of storage at _80°c and _20°c.145re_freezing of reconstituted vials could in theory minimize waste , but it should be noted that this currently goes against manufacturer ’ s instructions , since once the vial seal is punctured the sterility barrier has been broken.106therefore , the product should be used within 12 hours ( per label ) and then dis_ carded to prevent microbial contamination . thus , reformulation of mrna_lnps products with antimicrobial preservatives to allow for more prolonged storage after opening the multidose vial ( e.g. , for up to 28 days ) is a potential future option . to date , no systematic studies of mrna_lnp products with antimicrobial preservatives have been published . development of such multidose formulations will require ensuring the chemical and physical stability of the mrna_lnp compo_ nents as well as maintaining antimicrobial effectiveness during han_ dling conditions . an algorithm to model the status of critical quality_attributes over time based on temperature monitoring devices during transport and storage would help in stock management and reduce vaccine wast_ age , a major problem on a global scale —not speci ﬁcally for mrna covid_19 vaccines.146,147since mrna_lnp product degradation includes many different pathways , kis discusses the complexity of designing such multivariable algorithms.61in the assessment_report of the ema_chmp for the moderna covid_19 vaccine the following text can be found : ‘ in relation to mrna purity and stability , data on the degradation rate was provided and shown to demonstrate398 e. oude_blenke et al . / journal of pharmaceutical sciences 112 ( 2023 ) 386 −403 arrhenius behavior , with ﬁrst_order kinetics . the stability pro ﬁles were demonstrated to be predictable and amenable to modelling , enabling a good understanding of the chemical degradation pro_ cess ’ .148unfortunately , neither experimental data nor details to sup_ port this claim can be found in the public domain so far . moreover , it remains to be fully established if the chemical degradation process of mrna is the only critical quality attribute for vaccine performance as is indicated by observations e.g. , by kudsiova et al. , and selmin et al . on mrna_lnp particle size and aggregation.91,92such considerations play a key role in determining the selection of primary containers and secondary packaging , as well as the need for temperature moni_ toring devices during shipping and transport , for example , as described for covid vaccines by ramakanth et al.149 concluding remarks when will guidance be available for mrna and mrna_lnp product testing ? in earlier publications , we made the point that there is clearly a need for regulatory guidance documents —preferably globally har_ monized −that describe the critical quality_attributes and acceptance criteria for mrna_based products as de ﬁned by regulatory authori_ ties.6several articles in scienti ﬁc journals recently described the who_led efforts that aimed to facilitate regulatory convergence in the assessment of the covid vaccines . but at the time of these discus_sions , alignment on critical quality_attributes was not yet achieved , and details or speci ﬁcations were not disclosed . 43,44,48 when comparing to the ﬁeld of oligonucleotide_based drugs , authors from various drug companies worked together to publish the analytical methodology for characterization of the drug molecule and its impurities in a series of papers.150,151however , they deliberately avoided discussion of acceptance criteria : “ like those of any api , acceptance criteria for oligonucleotide apis are based on preclinical and clinical data , manufacturing process variability , and analytical control strategies . however , these factors are likely to vary dramati_ cally among oligonucleotide apis , rendering it impossible to provide even general suggestions on acceptance criteria ” .150in other words , acceptance criteria are data_driven and may vary between products and manufacturing processes . for the mrna vaccines , who committees took the initiative dur_ ing the pandemic , but we now see mrna_lnp vaccine manufacturing experts starting to share quality_attributes , analytical_methods and some data in the scienti ﬁc literature.39,42,50,51,152moreover , the us pharmacopeia has recently released their ﬁrst draft chapter on ana_ lytical procedures for mrna vaccine quality as discussed in detail above ( see tables 2 and 3 ) .49recently , the european pharmacopeia ( pheur ) announced that a new working party called mrnavac ( working party for mrna vaccines ) will be tasked with developing a consolidated strategy on future standards for mrna vaccines and their components.153when these standards are in place and more data are published , it will become more clear what ranges are achiev_ able and which limits may be acceptable . while suggested speci ﬁca_ tions for the currently approved vaccines have been summarized by daniel et al.,42it should be noted that the mrna technology is advancing rapidly and the currently used analytical methodologies , and their associated speci ﬁcations , will be further developed to keep pace with the progress . which changes to the formulation could be made to improve stability of mrna drug products ? as described above , changing the product presentation could improve the stability or enable storage of mrna products under non_ frozen conditions , for example , by presenting the mrna in a freeze_dried form as part of a kit for “ at_the_bedside ” mixing with the drug delivery system . but to improve the shelf_life of the canonical , cen_ trally produced mrna_lnp vaccine that could be stored as a liquid formulation in a refrigerator , several lessons_learned can be summa_ rized from the topics discussed in this review . naturally , these strate_ gies can be combined and are generally not mutually exclusive . theﬁrst lesson is the selection and design of excipients : lnp exci_ pients can contain and generate impurities that react with other exci_ pients and the mrna . the most important and abundant excipient of the lnp is the ionizable amino lipid . while oxidation of the amine headgroup is unlikely to be completely avoided by selecting a differ_ ent structure , the acyl tails of the lipid can be designed to prevent oxidation . the ionizable lipid dlin_mc3_dma in the onpattro/c210prod_ uct contains unsaturated acyl chains that can oxidize . the ionizable lipids in the approved mrna vaccine products both contain branched saturated tail structures that are not susceptible to oxidation . it is likely that this design choice was made to improve the product stabil_ ity and compatibility with the vulnerable mrna cargo , at least as one of the considerations . the other lnp excipient that is a well_known source of peroxides is the stabilizing peg_lipid . as suggested before by schoenmaker et al . alternative excipients such as a lipid_polysar_ cosine could have a similar stabilizing effect on the formulation , without the risk of introducing peroxides inherent to peg units.7,154 an example of how other excipients such as buffer ingredients can impact stability is the choice of tris instead of phosphate buffer.105in addition , other pharmaceutical products contain anti_oxidants and metal chelators to improve the stability,72and the use of both together has been shown to greatly stabilize plasmid dna.58these additives are not used in any of the current mrna_lnp products so if they are found to be compatible and useful , this is another step that could be made to potentially enable extended storage under non_fro_ zen conditions . further to the selection of high_quality , high_purity excipients . if peg_lipids are used , they can be vacuumdried to remove peroxides but the content will increase again when stored at higher tempera_ tures , unless covered with inert air and protected from light.74this demonstrates that proper handling and storage is also very important for the raw materials , as it will greatly improve the quality of the ﬁnal product . similarly , excipients that have been properly puri ﬁed from metal ions will enhance the storage stability . these are key examples of how the shelf_life of a mrna drug product can be improved by changing the quality of the excipients . finally , the quality and stability of the mrna drug product can be improved by carefully controlling all process parameters during manufacturing . as there are so many different steps in both the ds and dp production processes , and so many different ways the mrna or excipients could degrade , much can be gained from optimizing the conditions to minimize their occurrence . for example , one challenge with mrna products is their sensitivity to degradation by rnases , so proper protection against the introduction of adventitious rnases should be ensured . in addition , mixing of the components at acidic ph is a fundamental step in the standard lnp formulation process that can not be circumvented , because a charge on the ionizable lipid is required for complexation of the cargo . however , changing param_ eters such as ph , ionic strength , holding time at low ph , temperature and light exposure during processing can still have a big impact on the formation of impurities even before storage . what challenges remain en route to thermostable mrna drug products ? with few exceptions , vaccines and therapeutic candidates based on ivt_transcribed mrna are , at present , complex assemblies of the nucleic_acid and lipid compounds that form nanoparticles . as such , the stability of these mrna_based drug products on storage remainse . oude_blenke et al . / journal of pharmaceutical sciences 112 ( 2023 ) 386 −403 399 a challenge for three main reasons : 1 ) mrna is not an intrinsically stable molecule , 2 ) lipid components required for delivery must be essentially free of impurities that can induce mrna degradation , and 3 ) the physical stability of mrna_lnp complexes is precarious , and sensitive to handling and thermal effects . one of the key stabilization strategies in active development for formulated mrna drug products to be stored in the refrigerator is lyophilization . this is logical , given the success of this dehydration approach with other biological products including other vaccines.155,156overcoming the cryo_ and lyo_induced particle degra_ dation effects is a key goal to be tackled to make freeze_dried mrnas formulated in lnps successful product candidates . if these hurdles can be addressed , then the prospects for leaving the freezer for long_ term storage look promising . an example of an mrna_lnp product currently in a phase 3 trial as a lyophilized product is moderna ’ s cmv vaccine.157however , the worldwide capacity for production of lyophilized products is limited . therefore , such an approach has lim_ ited utility for certain therapeutic applications , for example , mrna vaccines that require billions of doses to be produced per year for global use . packaging approaches including selection of the primary con_ tainer to preserve the formulated mrna dp integrity and increase ease of use are future targets for improvements . currently , vial prod_ ucts are the main option feasible for frozen liquids . freezing pre_ ﬁlled syringes is a challenge , because of the volume expansion of frozen water and the reduction in trapped air pressure during the freezing process , but recently technical solutions have been proposed.158 other packaging approaches are being explored as well . for example , systems using dual_chamber cartridges where the lyo cake ( pre_ formed in the syringe barrel ) is separated by a stopper from the liquid for reconstitution , are being actively tested.159pre_ﬁlled syringe options may be attractive for future therapeutic uses of mrna , but are not currently compatible with the high volume , multi_dose usage that has been required for the covid_19 vaccines for ﬁghting the ongoing pandemic . we may therefore see the continued use of glass vials during pandemics or other large_scale uses of mrna vaccines rather than a migration to pre ﬁlled syringes as product presentation . thermal stability improvements of ivt mrna and formulated mrna_lnp assemblies remains an active effort across the vaccine industry and academia , and the understanding of ways to improve their stability pro ﬁles is increasing . the capture of “ wins ” can occur in stages . the improved storage conditions that were granted for pﬁzer/biontech ’ s comirnaty/c210are an example of this approach : the liquid product can be frozen through depot storage , after which the product can be stored refrigerated until use for a period of 10 weeks ; previously , it was limited to 30 days.105a lyophilized product could offer the same possibility of relaxed temperature storage conditions : for example , a refrigerated lyophilized product through depot stor_ age , with the “ last mile ” storage being at room_temperature . in summary , for the mrna_based vaccine and therapeutic candi_ dates in development , improvements in product quality will bene ﬁt from enhanced integration of fundamental teachings in pharmaceuti_ cal , ( bio ) chemistry and manufacturing sciences . the mrna formula_ tion literature has been expanding in the past two years and industry has been increasingly sharing key ﬁndings that can support develop_ ment of a wide variety of mrna products in the future . the urgency ofﬁghting the covid_19 pandemic by employing mrna vaccines has enabled tremendous learnings , and unprecedented focus on applying them , to commercialize mrna —based products . this should lead to the development , regulatory approval and distribution of future mrna_based products with improved storage pro ﬁles to ensure safety and effectiveness in an increasing array of unmet medical needs . thus , the quest for improved storage and in_use_stability of formulated mrna vaccines and therapeutics continues and is de ﬁ_ nitely nota cold case.declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

for those previously_infected vs uninfected ; and by age_group ( < 35 , 35_55 , and > 55 years ) among pre_ viously uninfected individuals , using the t test after log transformation . correlation between age and log_transformed antibody levels was assessed with pearson correlation . to adjust for con_ founding , a multiple linear_regression was  itted with inclusion of age , sex , previous infection , and time between vaccination and serologic testing . all tests were 2_sided with statistical signi icance set at α = .05 . analyses were performed using rstudio ( version 1.2.1335 ) . this study was approved by the local institutional_review_board ; participants provided written informed_consent.1,2 10 10 results of 2499 health care workers who received 2 doses of sars_cov_2 mrna vaccines , 1647 partici_ pated in this study . a total of 688 were vaccinated with mrna_1273 ( mean age , 43.2 years ; 76.7 % women ; 21.8 % previously_infected with sars_cov_2 ) , and 959 with bnt162b2 ( mean age , 44.7 years ; 84.9 % women ; 13.2 % previously_infected ) . higher antibody titers were observed in participants vaccinated with 2 doses of mrna_1273 com_ pared with those vaccinated with bnt162b2 ( geometric mean titer [ gmt ] , 3836 u/ml [ 95 % ci , 3586_4104 ] vs 1444 u/ml [ 95 % ci , 1350_1544 ] ; p < .001 ) ( figure , a ) . previously_infected participants had higher antibody titers ( gmt , 9461 u/ml [ 95 % ci , 8494_10 539 ] ) compared with previously uninfected participants ( gmt , 1613 u/ml [ 95 % ci , 1539_1690 ] ) ( p < .001 ) . in both groups , those vaccinated with mrna_1273 had higher antibody titers compared with those vaccinated with bnt162b2 ( previously uninfected : gmt , 2881 u/ml [ 95 % ci , 2721_ 3051 ] vs 1108 u/ml [ 95 % ci , 1049_1170 ] ; p < .001 ; previously_infected : gmt , 10 708 u/ml [ 95 % ci , 9311_12 315 ] vs 8174 u/ml [ 95 % ci , 6923_9649 ] ; p = .01 ) . the difference in antibody levels according to previous infection was higher than the difference between the 2 mrna vaccines ( figure , b , and table ) . antibody levels negatively correlated with age in previously uninfected participants ( correlation coef icient , −0.22 ; p < .001 ) , being highest among those younger than 35 years . across all age cate_ gories , previously uninfected participants vaccinated with mrna_1273 had higher antibody titers compared with those vaccinated with bnt162b2 ( p < .001 for all comparisons ; figure , c ) . the type of mrna vaccine remained independently associated with the log_transformed antibody titer in a multiple linear_regression ( p < .001 ; table ) . discussion this study demonstrated a signi icantly higher humoral immunogenicity of the sars_cov_2 mrna_ 1273 vaccine ( moderna ) compared with the bnt162b2 vaccine ( p izer_biontech ) , in infected as well as uninfected participants , and across age categories . the higher mrna content in mrna_ 1273 compared with bnt162b2 and the longer interval between priming and boosting for mrna_ 1273 ( 4 weeks vs 3 weeks for bnt162b2 ) might explain this difference . a relationship between neutralization level after sars_cov_2 vaccination and protection against covid_19 has been demonstrated by several studies . as such , the height of the humoral response after vaccination , which correlates with neutralizing_antibody titers , might be clinically relevant . limitations of this study include the lack of data on cellular immunity and on neutralizing antibod_ ies , as well as the speci ic focus on health care workers . whether the observed difference in anti_ body level translates to a difference in the duration of protection , the protection against variants3 4 5 4 of concern , and the risk of transmission needs further investigation . future research should also address the relevance for patients with reduced antibody response after vaccination . notes s e c t i o n e d i t o r s : jody w. zylke , md , deputy editor ;

comirnaty™ ; spikevax™ ; dls ; in_use_stability testing ; tem 1 . introduction the recent pandemic caused by the sars_cov2 virus has revealed a new vaccination strategy based on the encapsulation of the mrna into lipid nanoparticles ( mrna_lnps ) [ 1 ] . this has allowed for a rapid , safe , and effective response from the pharmaceutical ﬁeld ( public/private sector collaboration ) for the covid_19 pandemic , declared on 11 march 2020 by the world_health_organization ( who ) . recently ( 5 may 2023 ) , the who deter_ mined that “ covid_19 is now an established and ongoing health issue which no longer constitutes a public health emergency of international concern ” [ 2 ] . notwithstanding the latter , it can not be lowered the guard against this disease , and the who updated the 2023–2025 covid_19 strategic preparedness and response plan [ 3 ] . vaccine research is one of the 10 covid_19 operational pillars proposed in this document , and who ’ s role in supporting member states ’ vaccination programmes will continue . comirnaty_™and spikevax_™are the ﬁrst vaccines approved for human use using this new delivery strategy based on mrna_lnps that encapsulate modiﬁed non_replicating vaccines 2023 ,11 , 1635. https : //doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11111635 https : //www.mdpi.com/journal/vaccines vaccines 2023 ,11 , 1635 2 of 19 mrna lipophilic nanoparticles ( mrna_lnp ) , vaccines in which the nucleic_acid encodes for the spike_protein [ 4 ] . they have been the most administered , for example , in europe [ 5 ] . therefore , this nanotechnology has proved successful in the prevention of covid_19 , demonstrated to be a fast and secure platform , leading to the development of future mrna_lnp_based products [ 6 ] . however , one of the major inconveniences of these types of vaccines is related to pharmaceutical stability issues [ 7 ] . proper transportation , storage , and in_use handling before administration to patients are critical steps since failures can potentially reduce potency , thereby causing problems in the immune response . new products with improved in_use_stability and storage proﬁles are required to meet medical needs worldwide [ 8 ] . in addition , the published literature regarding the long_term stability of mrna_lnps is scarce [ 4 ] , likely attributed to the great emergency generated by the covid_19 pandemic that promoted fast authorisation by regulatory authorities worldwide . the stability of these two vaccines is deeply related to temperature , which limits its global use by ultracold storage_requirements [ 9 ] . nevertheless , and despite being based on the same nanotechnology , they have different thermal stabilities [ 10 ] , likely related to the different lnp composition , both in the components and in the molar lipid ratios [ 4 ] . comirnaty_™ ( tozinameran ) is a concentrate for dispersion for the injection of the covid_19 mrna vaccine ( nucleoside modiﬁed ) [ 11 ] . each purple vial contains 0.45 ml of white to off_ white concentrate , which is diluted in 1.8 ml of 0.9 % sodium chloride solution to give a total volume of 2.25 ml ( six doses ) . the long_term stability of the frozen dispersion is 18 months stored at 90c to 60c ; for transportation , vials can be stored at  25c to 15c for a single period of two weeks and can be returned to the previous temperature stored conditions . thawed vials are stable for one month at 2c to 8c but keep this stability for only 48 h when transported , and these unopened vials remain stable for up to two hours at 30c prior to use . once the dilution has been performed , chemical and physical in_use_stability has been demonstrated for up to 6 h at 2c to 30c . spikevax_™ ( elasomeran ) is a white to off_white dispersion for injection with different formats : 0.2 mg/ml multidose vials ( red ﬂip_off cap ) with a maximum of 10 doses ( 50 mcg per dose ) and 20 doses ( 25 mcg per dose ) ; and 0.1 mg/ml multidose vials ( blue ﬂip_off cap ) containing ﬁve doses of 50 mcg and pre_ﬁlled syringes with individual doses of 0.5 ml ( 50 mcg ) . the long_term stability of the frozen dispersions is 9 months stored at  50c to 15c . chemical and physical in_use_stability has been proved for the unopened vial stored at 2c to 8c protected from light for up to 30 days once thawed ; within this period , up to 12 h may be used for transportation at the same temperature conditions . chemical and physical in_use_stability has been demonstrated for 19 h at 2c to 25c after the initial puncture ( within the allowed use period of 30 days at 2c to 8c and including 24 h at 8c to 25c ) . few research groups have assessed the in_use_stability of the comirnaty_™vaccine . to the best of our knowledge , among the published papers , none have focused on the spikevax_™vaccine . the colloidal stability of the comirnaty_™vaccine in syringes made of different materials , when subjected to mechanical—manually pumped through 2 ml syringe and leftovers in vials vortexed—and thermal—25c/24 h and 40c/1 h—stresses of relatively low intensity and short duration was demonstrated [ 12 ] . notwithstanding this , knocking over or dropping comirnaty_™vaccine samples from small heights showed a low level of physical instability , indicating a low risk of compromising efﬁcacy [ 13 ] . also , changes in size and species distributions of comirnaty_™samples after exposure to different stress_factors ( heat  30c , 50c and 80c for 4 h , mechanical , vortexed , and freeze/thaw stress ) in pbs buffer have been reported [ 14 ] . in this research , the in_use_stability of comirnaty_™and spikevax_™clinical samples was analysed and results compared . for this purpose , modiﬁcations of the size and structure of the mrna_lnps that contain the mrna were qualitatively analysed by dynamic_light_scattering ( dls ) as a stability_indicating method for control and stressed vaccines samples . strong stress_factors ( accelerated light irradiation , manual_shaking , and vortex vibration ) and conditions that mimic in_use handling ( exposure to natural light and room_temperature , repeated cycles of injections and 24 h storage in syringes ) were vaccines 2023 ,11 , 1635 3 of 19 investigated . the morphology of the mrna_lnps was analysed by transmission_electron_microscopy ( tem ) to better interpret and support the dls results . to the best of our knowledge , this is the ﬁrst work showing this kind of data on the spikevax™ vaccine . 2 . materials and methods 2.1 . vaccines , solutions , and materials to prepare the clinical dispersions of the vaccines , unexpired_and_expired multidose vials from different batches of comirnaty_™ ( pﬁzer_biontech : pﬁzer manufacturing bel_ gium nv , puurs , belgium and biontech manufacturing gmbh , mainz , germany ) and spikevax_™ ( moderna : moderna biotech spain s.l. , madrid , spain ) ( table 1 ) , 10 ml sodium chloride 0.9 % iv injection ampoules ( b. braun , melsungen , germany ) , bd microlance ™3 18 g x 11 200needles , 1 ml u_100 insulin bd plastipak ™syringes , and 5 ml syringes ( becton , dickinson and company limited , drogheda , ireland ) were used . all these materials were supplied by the hospital pharmacy unit from the san cecilio university clinical hospital ( granada , spain ) . for stress_testing , 2 ml amber ram vials with a 9 mm thread and 2 ml clear ram vials with a 9 mm thread ( symta , madrid , spain ) were used . table 1 . comirnaty™ and spikevax™ batches used in the study . vaccine expired batches unexpired batches comirnaty™ fg4686 ( exp . 11/2021 ) 1 fp8545 ( exp . 07/2022 ) 1 ik081a ( exp . 07/2022 ) 2 spikevax™ 000095a ( exp . 05/2022 ) 1,33006323 ( exp . 05/2022 ) 1 1vials from these batches were used in the forced degradation studies ; 2vials from this batch were used in the 24 h stability study ; 3exceeded for more than 30 days after defrosting . 2.2 . stability study 2.2.1 . aseptic pharmaceutical preparation the unexpired_and_expired comirnaty_™and spikevax_™vials were stored refrigerated at 2–8c until use . the clinical dispersions were handled and prepared according to their respective summaries of product characteristics [ 11,15 ] . accordingly , comirnaty_™original multidose vials ( purple tape ; 0.45 ml of prediluted concentrate ) were diluted in nacl 0.9 % as follows : 1.8 ml of saline solution was taken from the nacl ampoules and injected into the vials to result in a total volume of 2.25 ml ( 6 doses of 0.3 ml ) . in the case of spikevax_™ , the original multidose vials ( red tape ; 5 ml ) contained a ready_to_administer dispersion for injection ( 10 doses of 0.5 ml or 20 doses of 0.25 ml ) ; thus , no prior dilution was required . 2.2.2 . stress_factors study the expired comirnaty_™and spikevax_™clinical samples were subjected to several stressing conditions : ( i ) placed in transparent 2 ml glass vials and exposed to accelerated artiﬁcial light irradiation ( 250 w/m2 ) for 24 h in an ageing chamber ( solarbox 3000e rh , cofomegra , milan , italy ) , ( ii ) placed in clear 2 ml glass vials and exposed to natural light for 24 h at room_temperature ( rt ) , ( iii ) exposed to mechanical stress by performing several repeated injections ( 1 and 3 ) at 300 l/s using the syringes and the 18 g needles as indicated above , ( iv ) exposure to mechanical stress by subjecting the samples to manual vigorous shaking for 10 s , and ( v ) exposed to mechanical stress by subjecting the samples to vibration by vortex at 2400 rpm for 10 s. the unexpired_comirnaty ™and spikevax_™samples were subjected to the following stress conditions : ( i ) exposure to mechanical stress by subjecting the samples to manual vigorous shaking for 10 s and ( ii ) exposure to mechanical stress by subjecting the samples to vibration by vortex at 2400 rpm for 10 s. this study was conducted in triplicate , with both the unexpired_and_expired comirnaty™ and spikevax™ samples . vaccines 2023 ,11 , 1635 4 of 19 2.2.3 . twenty_four hour stability study due to the decision of the hospital to discontinue the use of spikevax_™ , the stability for 24 h was conducted only with comirnaty_™samples . then , single doses of 300 l of comirnaty_™unexpired dispersions were stored as follows : ( i ) placed in 1 ml syringes and refrigerated at 2–8c protected from daylight , ( ii ) placed in 1 ml syringes and stored at room_temperature ( rt ) with air_conditioning ( 20c ) not protected from daylight , ( iii ) placed in 1 ml syringes and stored at rt without air_conditioning ( thermal excursion 18–35c ) not protected from daylight , ( iv ) placed in 1 ml syringes and stored at  20c protected from daylight , and ( v ) stored in the original vaccine glass vials refrigerated at 2–8c protected from daylight . this study was conducted in duplicate . 2.3 . visual characteristics all vaccine samples were visually inspected to determine colour changes , suspended particulates , turbidity , and gas formation . to this end , samples were visually analysed using the naked_eye , and different pictures of the dispersions were taken ( supplementary data figure s1 ) for deeper analysis . 2.4 . dynamic_light_scattering ( dls ) the particle size distribution proﬁles of comirnaty_™and spikevax_™clinical disper_ sions were assessed by dls . for the analysis , disposable low_volume cuvettes ( zen0118 ) for size measurements ( iesmat , spain ) were used . then , the particles size_distribution_graphs by volume and intensity , the population hydrodynamic diameter ( dh ) , the z_ average , and the polydispersity index ( pdi ) of the samples were evaluated by photon correlation spectroscopy ( pcs ) using a dynamic light scatterer ( dls , zetasizer nano zs_90 , malvern panalytical , malvern , uk ) , equipped with a backscattered light detector , operating at an angle of 90and a ﬁxed temperature of 25c . the results were calculated using the zetasizer software ver . 7.13 ( malvern panalytical , malvern , uk ) . all comirnaty_™and spikevax_™unexpired_and_expired clinical samples were as_ sessed by dls , that is , samples from stress_factors and 24 h stability studies . 2.5 . transmission_electron_microscopy ( tem ) this technique was used to characterise the mrna_lnp morphology and size of the comirnaty_™and spikevax_™samples in order to support the dls data . the samples analysed by tem were selected , taking into account the dls results . for comirnaty_™ , tem analyses were performed on unexpired_and_expired samples . the unexpired ones ( control ) were subjected to mechanical stress : vortex vibration at 2400 rpm for 10 s and manual vigorous shaking for 10 s ; this last sample was 30 days stored at 2–8c and reanalysed by tem . the unstressed expired comirnaty_™samples were also analysed . in the case of spikevax_™ , only expired_samples could be analysed ; these ( control ) were subjected to manual vigorous shaking for 10 s and vibration by vortex at 2400 rpm for 10 s. dispersion samples were negatively stained . for this , 25 l of the suspensions were incubated on a grid with supporting ﬁlm ( formvar ) for 5 min in a petri_dish . the grids were then washed two times for 1 min with ultrapure water , 2 1 min . the contrast was conducted with uranyl acetate ( 1 % ) in an aqueous_solution for 1 min . finally , grids were dried on ﬁlter paper . images were obtained using a zeiss 902 electron microscope ( zeiss , oberkochen , germany ) operating at an accelerating voltage of 120 kv and observed at a magniﬁcation of 50,000 . 2.6 . data analysis statistical differences in the mean values of z_average , pdi , and dh of the populations and their respective percent abundances of all vaccine samples from the stress_factors and 24 h stability studies were analysed by one_way analysis of variance ( one_way anova ) , followed by dunnett ’ s post hoc test ( multiple comparisons with respect to control sam_ vaccines 2023 ,11 , 1635 5 of 19 ples ) using graphpad prism 7.00 software . differences were considered signiﬁcant at a p_value < 0.05 . 3 . results 3.1 . visual characteristics unexpired_comirnaty ™dispersions colour was off_white , whereas comirnaty_™ex_ pired dispersions had an off_white to white colour , which turned more intense the longer the expiration . as for the stresses performed , the turbidity of comirnaty_™samples increased after being subjected to the speciﬁc conditions , mainly by mechanical stresses ( pictures shown in supplementary data figure s1 ) . in the case of the spikevax_™dispersions , the colour was a constant off_white to white colour regardless of the stress condition applied and the expiration_date . 3.2 . dynamic_light_scattering 3.2.1 . characterisation of comirnaty™ clinical dispersions : a comparative study of unexpired_and_expired samples the unexpired_and_expired samples from several comirnaty_™vials were analysed by dls to obtain their characteristic particle size distribution proﬁles . dls data by volume are shown in figure 1 , whereas intensity data are shown in supplementary data figure s2 . figure 1 . size_distribution_graphs by volume of several representative comirnaty_™samples from ( a ) unexpired and ( b ) expired vials . dls_parameters are included in the table ( z_average and pdi ) . a/d : analysis date ; z_av : z_average . the unexpired_comirnaty ™freshly prepared dispersions from three vials ( batches fp8545 and ik081a ) were characterised by a main population with a dh of 60–65 nm that represented over 99 % of the total volume in all the vials analysed . a second population of 5000 nm was observed in all the vials , representing less than 1 % of the total volume ( figure 1a ) . results were similar in these three samples , which had different time left to expiration ( two months and several days ) . the expired comirnaty_™samples were also analysed after dilution , and the results are shown in figure 1b . all vials analysed belonged to the same batch ( fg4686 ) and were 1 month ( vial 1 ) , 2 months ( vial 2 ) , and 4 months ( vial 3 ) expired by the time of the analyses . the particle size proﬁles indicated the presence of three clear resolved populations : the most abundant with an average dh of 60–65 nm accounting for over 90 % of the total volume in the samples analysed ( vial 1 : 94 % , vial 2 : 92 % , and vial 3 : 90 % ) , a second population with a dh of 600–700 nm also detected in all vials on a proportion of 5–10 % , and a third population with an average dh of 5000 nm , only detected in vials 2 and 3 ( 1.2 % and 2.8 % by volume , respectively ) . vaccines 2023 ,11 , 1635 6 of 19 these results suggested that the population associated with the individual mrna_ lnps has an average dh of 60–65 nm . then , the other two populations were associated with product_related degradation particles . a gradual decrease in the proportion of the main population in favour of degraded populations in the expired_samples , accompanied by increases in z_average and pdi values over time , was observed ( tables included in figure 1 ) . the z_average increased proportionally to expiration times , as did the pdi values . cumulant analysis conﬁrmed that unexpired samples were relatively monodisperse ( pdi around 0.2 ) ; on the contrary , expired_samples were moderately polydisperse ( vial 1 pdi around 0.42 and vial 2 pdi around 0.45 ) and highly polydisperse ( vial 3 pdi around 0.70 ) . these results clearly indicated an increase in the polydispersity over time in the comirnaty™ vaccine dispersion by the detection of new larger species . particle size_distribution_graphs by intensity are shown in supplementary data figure s2 . as expected , data are similar to the previous ones : a main population is ob_ served in unexpired_comirnaty samples , in addition to the second population at 5000 nm when reported by volume . expired_samples also show a similar size distribution proﬁle with the three size populations . however , intensity data overestimate the high molecular weight species . 3.2.2 . characterisation of spikevax™ clinical dispersions : a comparative study of unexpired_and_expired samples the unexpired_and_expired samples from several spikevax_™vials were analysed by dls . in figure 2 , dls data are shown . vaccines 2023 , 11 , x for peer_review 7 of 20 figure 2 . size_distribution_graphs by volume of seve ral representative spikevax™ clinical samples from ( a ) unexpired and ( b ) expired vials . dls_parameters are in cluded in the table ( z_average and pdi ) . a/d : analysis date ; z_av : z_average . 3.2.3 . stress_factors study to evaluate how handling/m ishandling practices may a ﬀect the colloidal stability of the dispersions , a set of appropriate stress conditions was checked on the unexpired_and_expired samples from both vacci nes . expired material already showed starting levels of product_related degradation , i.e. , larger species/colour changes ( in comirnaty™ ) and modi ﬁcations in the particle size distribution ( in spikevax™ ) , as described in the previous sections . therefore , evaluating this expired mate rial after subjecting it to stress conditions can be considered the worst_case scenario for the assessment of product robustness against degradation . comparing the results from the two vaccines analysed under these stress_factors allows conclusions to be drawn as to which of the two products is more stable . representative size_distribution_graphs of unexpired_and_expired samples were es_ tablished as controls ( figures 3 and 4 ) , in addition to their dls_parameters , expressed as mean ± standard_deviation from three independent replicates ( table 2 ) . figure 2 . size_distribution_graphs by volume of several representative spikevax_™clinical samples from ( a ) unexpired and ( b ) expired vials . dls_parameters are included in the table ( z_average and pdi ) . a/d : analysis date ; z_av : z_average . unexpired spikevax_™dispersion from the vial analysed ( batch 3006323 ) was char_ acterised by three unresolved populations ( ranging from 30 nm to 1000 nm ) on differ_ ent percentages , the most abundant with a dh of 100–200 nm on a 50 % approximately ( figure 2a ) . two expired spikevax_™vials ( same expiration times ) from the same batch ( 000095a ) were also analysed , both displaying identical size_distribution_graphs , with three unresolved populations ranging from 30 nm to 1000 nm ( figure 2b ) as in the unexpired samples , although the major population observed in this case was the one with a dh of 30–100 nm , which represented approximately 36 % by volume , and the other two populations had dh of 100–200 nm and 200–1000 nm , respectively . thus , the population with dh of 100–200 nm was associated with the single mrna_lnps , whereas the other two populations might be explained as product_related degradation . these vials were expired because they had vaccines 2023 ,11 , 1635 7 of 19 exceeded the 30_day stability at 2–8c after withdrawing from the freezer as indicated by the spc . regarding the dls_parameters ( z_average and pdi ) , no differences were observed between unexpired_and_expired spikevax_™samples despite the different size proﬁles indicated by the graphs ( figure 2 ) . pdi was approximately 0.2 in all samples analysed ( moderately monodisperse ) . particle size_distribution_graphs by intensity are shown in supplementary data figure s2 . the fact that the z_average and pdi of the expired_samples do not change in the expired_samples with respect to unexpired ones is explained by these graphs : a single polydisperse population is observed , even after stress_testing . however , after transforming intensity into volume data , three populations could be detected , and modiﬁcations in their relative abundances between expired/unexpired samples and even after stress_testing . 3.2.3 . stress_factors study to evaluate how handling/mishandling practices may affect the colloidal stability of the dispersions , a set of appropriate stress conditions was checked on the unexpired_and_expired samples from both vaccines . expired material already showed starting levels of product_related degradation , i.e. , larger species/colour changes ( in comirnaty_™ ) and modiﬁcations in the particle size distribution ( in spikevax_™ ) , as described in the previous sections . therefore , evaluating this expired material after subjecting it to stress conditions can be considered the worst_case scenario for the assessment of product robustness against degradation . comparing the results from the two vaccines analysed under these stress_factors allows conclusions to be drawn as to which of the two products is more stable . representative size_distribution_graphs of unexpired_and_expired samples were es_ tablished as controls ( figures 3 and 4 ) , in addition to their dls_parameters , expressed as meanstandard_deviation from three independent replicates ( table 2 ) . in figure 3a , the size_distribution_graphs of unexpired_comirnaty ™samples after applying mechanical stress are shown . the control graph indicates a main population with a dh of 60–65 nm ( representing over 99 % by volume , table 2 ) . mechanical stresses provoked clear degradation ( table 2 ) in the manually shaken samples ( detection of a new polydisperse population with a dh of 600 60 nm , 5.5 % volume ) and in the vortex_ stressed samples ( detection of a new population with a dh of 1000 200 nm , 1 % volume ) ; degradation was proportional to the intensity of the stress . in addition , the volume of the population at 5000 nm decreased in both stress samples ( representing a volume inferior to 1 % in all cases ) . dls_parameters reﬂected these results ( table 2 ) , i.e. , the average particle size and the polydispersity increased in the mechanically stressed samples with respect to the control : z_average from 88 1 nm ( control ) to 116 8 nm ( manual_shaking ) and to 961 nm ( vortex stress ) and pdi from 0.23 0.01 ( control ) to 0.38 0.02 ( manual_shaking ) and to 0.260.01 ( vortex stress ) . the results were statistically signiﬁcant for the samples manually shaken ( table 2 ) . however , the results were not statistically signiﬁcant for the samples vortex stressed . in figure 3b–d , graphs from stressed expired comirnaty_™samples are shown . the control samples show a main population with a dh of 60–65 nm , representing 88–90 % of the total volume . figure 3b , which shows the artiﬁcial light exposure results , can be observed how the populations detected in the expired control samples were kept almost identical after the stress was applied . this was conﬁrmed by the dls_parameters ( table 2 ) . in figure 3c , concerning mechanical stresses , the populations observed in the stressed samples were similar to the control ; however , a signiﬁcant increase in the abundance of the population with dh of 600–700 nm was observed when vortex stressed , which also occurred with unexpired samples ( figure 3a ) . regarding the dls_parameters , the z_average values increased ( table 2 ) , indicating an increase in the content of larger species . pdi was kept around 0.7 for all samples , indicating very high polydispersity . in figure 3d , regarding the samples undergoing cycles of repeated injections , a signiﬁcant increase in the abundance of the population of 600–700 nm was observed when three cycles were performed , while the vaccines 2023 ,11 , 1635 8 of 19 dls_parameters were very similar to the expired control with no signiﬁcant differences , only a slight increase was observed in the z_average , this indicated that injections caused an increase in the content of larger mrna_lnp species to a small extent . vaccines 2023 , 11 , x for peer_review 10 of 20 figure 3 . representative size_distribution_graphs by volume of several comirnaty™ unexpired sam_ ples subjected to manual_shaking and vibration by vortex ( a ) and expired_samples subjected to artiﬁcial light stress ( b ) , manual_shaking and vibration by vortex ( c ) , and 1 and 3 repeated cycles of injections with syringes ( d ) . a/d : analysis date . in figure 4a , representative size distri bution graphs of unexpired spikevax™ sam_ ples after applying mechanical stresses are show n. in both mechanically stressed samples , only the two larger populations were detected . with regard to the dls_parameters , these were similar to the control with no signi_ﬁcant diﬀerences , although there were slight in_ creases in the z_average : from 218 ± 1 nm ( control ) to 222 ± 3 nm ( manual_shaking ) and the pdi from 0.220 ± 0.003 ( control ) to 0.23 ± 0.01 ( manual_shaking ) were observed . in figure 4b–d , representative graphs fr om stressed expired spikevax™ samples are shown . in figure 4b , the size distribution gr aphs of samples light stressed were slightly diﬀerent to the control ones ; the main populati on with a dh of 30–100 nm slightly in_ creased its size . however , the dls_parameters were not modi ﬁed ( table 2 ) . figure 4c shows that the vortex did not a ﬀect the size distribution , wher eas an increase in the aver_ age particle size was observed when manually shaken . again , with regard to the dls pa_ rameters , no signi_ﬁcant diﬀerences were detected , although a slight increase in the z_av_ erage after manual_shaking was observed ( table 2 ) , as occurred with unexpired samples . figure 4d indicates that one injection cycl e did not promote changes in the vaccine dis_ persion ; however , after three repeated cycl es , the main population ( dh 30–100 nm ) disap_ peared , and a new population with a higher size ( 40–200 nm ) was detected ; the dls pa_ rameters were not altered in any of the samples despite these observed modi ﬁcations in the size_distribution_graphs ( table 2 ) . figure 3 . representative size_distribution_graphs by volume of several comirnaty_™unexpired samples subjected to manual_shaking and vibration by vortex ( a ) and expired_samples subjected to artiﬁcial light stress ( b ) , manual_shaking and vibration by vortex ( c ) , and 1 and 3 repeated cycles of injections with syringes ( d ) . a/d : analysis date . in figure 4a , representative size_distribution_graphs of unexpired spikevax_™samples after applying mechanical stresses are shown . in both mechanically stressed samples , only the two larger populations were detected . with regard to the dls_parameters , these were similar to the control with no signiﬁcant differences , although there were slight increases in the z_average : from 218 1 nm ( control ) to 222 3 nm ( manual_shaking ) and the pdi from 0.2200.003 ( control ) to 0.23 0.01 ( manual_shaking ) were observed . in figure 4b–d , representative graphs from stressed expired spikevax_™samples are shown . in figure 4b , the size_distribution_graphs of samples light stressed were slightly different to the control ones ; the main population with a dh of 30–100 nm slightly increased its size . however , the dls_parameters were not modiﬁed ( table 2 ) . figure 4c shows that the vortex did not affect the size distribution , whereas an increase in the average particle size was observed when manually shaken . again , with regard to the dls_parameters , no signiﬁcant differences were detected , although a slight increase in the z_average after manual_shaking was observed ( table 2 ) , as occurred with unexpired samples . figure 4d indicates that one injection cycle did not promote changes in the vaccine dispersion ; however , after three repeated cycles , the main population ( dh 30–100 nm ) disappeared , and a new population with a higher size ( 40–200 nm ) was detected ; the dls_parameters were not altered in any of the samples despite these observed modiﬁcations in the size_distribution_graphs ( table 2 ) . vaccines 2023 ,11 , 1635 9 of 19 vaccines 2023 , 11 , x for peer_review 11 of 20 figure 4 . representative size_distribution_graphs by volume of spikevax™ unexpired samples sub_ jected to manual_shaking and vibration by vortex ( a ) and expired_samples subjected to arti ﬁcial light stress ( b ) , manual_shaking and vibration by vortex ( c ) , and 1 and 3 repeated cycles of injections with syringes ( d ) . a/d : analysis date . 3.2.4 . comirnaty™ 24_hour stability study ( unexpired samples ) as indicated in the materials and methods section , the 24 h stability study was per_ formed just on comirnaty™ due to the impossi bility of obtaining units of spikevax™ as a result of the change in the purchase of the covid_19 vaccines by the hospital pharmacy management unit . this study aimed to evaluate the stability of individual doses of co_ mirnaty™ prepared under clinical conditions . thus , they were stored in 1 ml syringes under di ﬀerent environmental conditions ( section 2.2.3 ) , intending to determine how dif_ ferent daily hospital practises may a ﬀect the physical stability of the dispersions . repre_ sentative size distribution graph of an unexpired_comirnaty™ freshly prepared sample ( figure 5 ) , in addition to the dls paramete rs , expressed as mean ± standard_deviation from two independent replicates ( table 3 ) , were established as control . the results for comirnaty™ control sample s were consistent with the previously characterised control samples ( section 3.2.1 ) . the size distribution graph ( figure 5 ) showed the main population at 60–65 nm , repr esenting over 99 % of the total volume and the larger population of 4500–5000 nm , repr esenting a rough 1 % . after comparing the control and 24 h stored samples , no meaningful changes were observed in the size distri_bution graphs for any tested conditions . dls_parameters remained una ﬀected as well in all samples except for the case of those stored in syringes at −20_°c ; in this case , the z average increased signi_ﬁcantly from 89.3 nm ± 0.9 nm to 99.2 nm ± 0.8 nm and pdi from 0.20 to 0.23 nm , indicating increase in the average particle size ( table 3 ) . to con ﬁrm this last , the samples stored at −20_°c were again subjected to a second freeze/thaw cycle , and it was corroborated that freezing/thawing promotes increases in figure 4 . representative size_distribution_graphs by volume of spikevax_™unexpired samples subjected to manual_shaking and vibration by vortex ( a ) and expired_samples subjected to artiﬁcial light stress ( b ) , manual_shaking and vibration by vortex ( c ) , and 1 and 3 repeated cycles of injections with syringes ( d ) . a/d : analysis date . 3.2.4 . comirnaty™ 24_h stability study ( unexpired samples ) as indicated in the materials and methods section , the 24 h stability study was per_ formed just on comirnaty_™due to the impossibility of obtaining units of spikevax_™as a result of the change in the purchase of the covid_19 vaccines by the hospital pharmacy management unit . this study aimed to evaluate the stability of individual doses of comir_ naty ™prepared under clinical conditions . thus , they were stored in 1 ml syringes under different environmental conditions ( section 2.2.3 ) , intending to determine how different daily hospital practises may affect the physical stability of the dispersions . representative size distribution graph of an unexpired_comirnaty ™freshly prepared sample ( figure 5 ) , in addition to the dls_parameters , expressed as mean standard_deviation from two independent replicates ( table 3 ) , were established as control . vaccines 2023 ,11 , 1635 10 of 19 table 2 . stability of comirnaty™ and spikevax™ clinical samples after stress_testing : assessment of z_average and pdi by dls . vaccinesparameters stress testz_average ( nm ) pdipopulation 1 ( volume ) population 2 ( volume ) population 3 ( volume ) dhsd ( nm ) volsd ( % ) d hsd ( nm ) volsd ( % ) d hsd ( nm ) volsd ( % ) pﬁzer_biontech ( comirnaty™ ) control 1 ( e ) 1473 0.690.04 641 89.60.7 70060 91 4800600 21 artiﬁcial light 24 h 1462 0.700.04 632 87.90.3 60050 10.3 5000 100 1.80.3 control 2 ( e ) 1494 0.700.04 622 88.600.06 65040 9.70.6 5100100 1.70.6 manual_shaking ( e ) 17020 0.700.10 612 87.20.3 68070 11.60.9 509030 1.30.6 vortex vibration ( e ) 1657 0.740.04 631 861 400300 131 * 5100200 1.60.3 control 3 ( e ) 147.10.6 0.710.03 632 88.90.6 70010 9.30.4 499060 1.80.6 syringe injection ( 1x ) ( e ) 1493 0.730.01 62.70.5 87.70.7 62020 10.50.8 5000100 1.70.2 syringe injection ( 3x ) ( e ) 1566 0.660.01 632 86.90.8 61030 121 * 510040 1.50.4 control 4 ( ne ) 881 0.230.01 63.00.9 99.400.06 np np 4400 200 0.6300.06 manual_shaking ( ne ) 1168 * 0.380.02 * 65.10.5 94.40.3 * 60060 5.50.3 4873 0.1 0.2 vortex vibration ( ne ) 961 0.260.01 65.20.9 98.50.6 1000200 11 4571 0.3 0.5 moderna ( spikevax™ ) control 1 ( e ) 2202 0.220.01 natural light 24 h ( e ) 2152 0.220.01 control 2 ( e ) 2214 0.210.01 manual_shaking ( e ) 2223 0.230.01 vortex vibration ( e ) 2204 0.220.01 control 3 ( e ) 2202 0.220.01 syringe injection ( 1x ) ( e ) 2202 0.220.01 syringe injection ( 3x ) ( e ) 2193 0.220.01 control 4 ( ne ) 2181 0.2200.003 manual_shaking ( ne ) 2223 0.230.01 vortex vibration ( ne ) 2162 0.210.01 data are reported as mean standard_deviation ( sd ) from 3 independent replicates ;

the z_average of the mrna_lnps was higher in the spikevax_™ samples , indicating a larger average size of the mrna_lnps . however , both vaccines had similar pdi values , which can be explained by the detection of a population in the comirnaty_™samples of approximately 5000 m ( 1 % of the total volume ) . on the other hand , dls data conﬁrmed differences between unexpired_and_expired material from both vaccines . in the case of comirnaty_™ , unexpired samples were signiﬁcantly different to the expired ones in regards to solution colour , size distributions and dls_parameters ; in the case of spikevax_™ , although signiﬁcant differences were not found in the dls_parameters , size distributions were remarkably different in expired_samples compared to unexpired ones . the stress_factors study was aimed at assessing the in_use_stability of clinical samples of the vaccines following their preparation . for this purpose , different relevant stressors were applied to samples from both vaccines . the results show that comirnaty_™has a natural likelihood to undergo aggregation , giving rise to two new particle populations by dls in addition to the main population associated with the individual mrna_lnps . the physical stability of comirnaty_™was mainly affected by mechanical stresses , as previously described and discussed [ 12 ] , and was not affected by the effects of light . avoiding quick dilutions , vigorous mixing , and accidental syringe/vial drops is paramount to ensure colloidal stability . in contrast , spikevax_™dispersions showed a more robust behaviour against stresses : size distributions were not easily readable , as the three unresolved popula_ tions ranging from 30 to 1000 nm were present in unexpired , expired , and stressed samples . however , mechanical stresses seemed to favour the formation of larger mrna_lnp pop_ ulations , as shown by dls ; in fact , the z_average values increased slightly in manually shaken unexpired_and_expired samples . recently , grau et al . [ 22 ] , assessed the stability of the mrna molecules from pﬁzer_biontech and moderna samples in syringes under movement conditions , simulating the transport of reconstituted syringes by road to the vaccination centres ; here , they demonstrated the stability of the mrnas from both vaccines under swing agitation conditions during 3 h. however , they reported mrna degradation in both vaccines after vortex stress . the comirnaty_™24 h study aimed to evaluate the stability of comirnaty_™after repackaging and storage of single doses in 1 ml plastic syringes . the results indicated a high stability of the dispersions under most of the storage conditions checked . this was also corroborated by other researchers [ 12 ] ; they demonstrated stability of the dispersions for 24 h stored refrigerated ( 2–8c ) and at room_temperature ( 25c ) , and 5 h at 40c , regardless of the packaging material , i.e. , polypropylene or carbonate syringes . in our study , comirnaty_™clinical dispersions were affected by storage at  20c for 24 h ( having undergone 1 f/t cycle ) . freezing is one of the most widely used methods for long_ term storage of many types of nanoparticles and is harmless when cryoprotectants are ensured [ 23 ] . however , it can alter the stability of nps by crystallisation and vacuum dehydration . in fact , aggregation of lipid nanoparticles was described mainly due to the freeze/thaw [ 24 ] . the dls results here indicated a clear increase in larger species after thawing from 20c to room_temperature . to better explore the mrna_lnps , tem was proposed as an orthogonal method to dls , allowing for a full characterisation of the mrna_lnps physical characteristics , concluding that the results obtained by both techniques were comparable . indeed , these are widely used techniques to study the size properties of nps . some articles provide comparative studies using both techniques to determine the size of nps [ 25,26 ] . the tem micrograph of the comirnaty_™control sample ( unexpired ) indicated spherical monodis_ perse particles , whose sizes were in agreement with dls size results . once the samples expired , an increase in the dls_parameters was associated with an increase in the average particle size by tem and also with loss of sphericality . as for the stress tests , manual_shaking and vortex stresses caused a clear increase in the dls_parameters and were associ_ ated with breakage and aggregation of the mrna_lnps . although these stress conditions vaccines 2023 ,11 , 1635 17 of 19 checked are strong and unlikely to occur in a realistic situation , the results highlight the way mechanical stresses might induce irreversible degradation of the nanoparticles . indeed , milder stress conditions have indicated starting degradation by dls , such as comirnaty_™ samples undergoing freeze/thaw cycles or repeated cycles of aspiration cycles with sy_ ringes . the tem results from spikevax_™were more complex to analyse ; a great number of particles and a wide range of sizes and morphologies were observed in all the samples . nevertheless , it can be concluded that spikevax_™samples were far more polydisperse than comirnaty™ . preserving the physical integrity of lnps in mrna vaccines is of paramount im_ portance as they serve to protect the mrna from release , thus preventing the action of endonucleases and increasing bioavailability in vivo . not only can vaccine efﬁcacy be jeopardised by mrna degradation , but patient_safety can also be an issue if mrna_lnps aggregate , as they could elicit undesirable immune reactions [ 27 ] . in this way , studies indi_ cate that ideal nanoparticle sizes for drug delivery range between 10 nm and 1000 nm [ 28 ] . in the case of mrna vaccines , uptake by antibody presenting cells is crucial being demon_ strated ideal sizes to be 80–100 nm [ 29 ] , whereas smaller lnp sizes favour recognition by dendritic_cells and bigger ones favour recognition by macrophages [ 30 ] . 5 . concluding remarks we show remarkable stability data for comirnaty_™ ( pﬁzer_biontech ) and spikevax_™ ( moderna ) covid_19 vaccines after preparation/storage and stress_testing . although both products are based on the same mrna_lnp technology , the results presented here demon_ strate that they are characterised by different particle size proﬁles , as well as behaviours against the different handling/stress conditions . comirnaty_™was shown to be mostly sensitive to mechanical stresses and freeze/thaw cycles from  20c to room_temperature , less affected by syringes injection cycles and not affected at all by the effects of light . on the other hand , spikevax_™samples were proven to be stable under most of the stress conditions tested with regard to dls_parameters , although changes in size distribution proﬁles were observed , particularly in samples subjected to mechanical stress . these data will be meaningful for healthcare professionals in hospitals and healthcare facilities , for the results clearly highlight the deleterious effects of improper manipulation on the sizes of the particulate of the vaccine dispersions , eventually affecting potency . this study was not intended to assess the chemical stability of the mrna molecule , which will be addressed in future research using high_resolution mass spectrometry analyses . the assessment of the mrna ’ s chemical and physical properties is also fundamental , as modiﬁcations of these properties might occur inside the protective nanoparticle , going unnoticed . on the other hand , this study also provides valuable knowledge on the different behaviour of mrna_lnps and , for the ﬁrst time , in_use_stability for the spikevax™ vaccine . 6 . limitations of the study one of the main limitations of this study was the limited availability of spikevax_™ vials , especially unexpired spikevax_™ones . in fact , the supply of these vials was stopped midway in the investigation . thus , more conclusions could be drawn regarding the stability of comirnaty_™than spikevax_™ . another aspect to take into account is that the unexpired spikevax_™vial analysed was proximate to its end_to_use date , which might explain the similar results obtained between both expired and unexpired samples . despite this , it was possible to draw consistent conclusions regarding the in_use_stability of both products since several expired vials from both vaccines were available . supplementary materials : the following supporting information can be downloaded at : https : //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/vaccines11111635/s1 , figure s1 : photographs of expired ( a ) and non_expired ( b ) comirnaty vials ;

( arch pathol lab med . 2022 ; 146:677–685 ; doi : 10.5858/ arpa.2021_0607_sa ) since its identiﬁcation as the cause of a novel respiratory pneumonia ﬁrst documented in wuhan , china , in december 2019 , sars_cov_2 has spread rapidly through_ out the globe , causing 221 million conﬁrmed infections and 4.5 million deaths as of september 2021.1,2although many infected persons experience only mild symptoms , others experience critical illness or death due to septic shock , multiorgan failure , or respiratory_failure.3the elderly and those with preexisting medical conditions are at highest risk for poor outcomes . postmortem evaluation ﬁrmly implicatessars_cov_2 as the cause of death , whereas preexisting conditions play only a minor contributory role.4 public health efforts advocating the

—kelliher et al 677 effects and adverse_reactions following mrna vaccine administration . many commercially available , automated immunoassays have been granted emergency_use_authorization for the measurement of spike antibodies . these assays may be routinely used in the future to conﬁrm immune statusfollowing viral infection or vaccination , although they are currently not approved for this purpose . others have described the spike antibody response at deﬁned timepoints following administration of bnt162b2 or mrna_ 1272 , but it is unknown whether these observations would extend to other commercially available test methods . 5–7,14 because trends in nucleocapsid antibody signal vary substantially depending on the analytical platform used , differences in assay design may also lead to markedly different patterns of spike antibody response following vaccination.15if future work demonstrates that serum antibody values measured shortly after vaccination predict the duration of seropositivity , assay_speciﬁc reference intervals may be required to identify individuals with asuboptimal response who may beneﬁt from more frequent reimmunization . the international standard and reference panel for anti–sars_cov_2 antibody testing was estab_lished in december 2020 by the world_health_organization expert committee on standardization to facilitate assay standardization across different platforms . 16 new data on the efﬁcacy of mrna vaccines against sars_cov_2 are rapidly becoming available . one study found that pﬁzer vaccine efﬁcacy peaked at 96.2 % between 7 days and 2 months following the second dose and then gradually declined to 83.7 % efﬁcacy after 4 months.17the us centers_for_disease_control and prevention ( cdc ) also released a study showing vaccine efﬁcacy in preventing hospitalization is higher for moderna ( 93 % ) relative topﬁzer ( 88 % ) and johnson_&_johnson ( 71 % ) . 18median antibody response was also substantially higher in individ_ uals receiving mrna vaccines ( moderna and pﬁzer ) 2 to 6 weeks following administration of the complete vaccine series ; the response was greatest in individuals receiving themoderna vaccine . 18however , many questions still remain about mrna vaccine efﬁcacy and duration of protection . it is unclear if antibody response at later time points everbecomes equivalent between the 2 mrna vaccines . it is also unknown whether the 2 vaccines elicit equivalent side_effects , and whether the severity of symptoms predicts anindividual ’ s antibody response . it is possible that distinctly different postvaccine proﬁles might help select the optimal vaccine for individuals of a given age or sex . here , we directly compare symptoms and spike antibody response during 6 months as measured by the roche elecsys anti_sars_cov_2 s automated immunoassay in predominantly seronegative individuals following administration of either the moderna or pﬁzer vaccine . materials and methods institutional review this study was approved by the medical center institutional_review_board . volunteer participation and sample collection participants were randomly assigned the moderna or pﬁzer vaccine based on the day of their appointment and were unable toindicate vaccine preference . after providing informed_consent , 154healthy adults aged 19 to 74 years recorded their preferred gender , date of birth , vaccine manufacturer , date of vaccination , and completed a survey regarding side_effects ( severity scale 0–5 ; supplemental digital content at https : //meridian.allenpress.com/ aplm in the june 2022 table of contents ) experienced following vaccination . demographic information can be found in supple_mental table 1 . all participants received the complete , 2_dose series of either the moderna or pﬁzer vaccine . serum samples were collected prior to vaccination from 8 participants who received moderna and 6 who received pﬁzer.participants receiving moderna ( n ¼81 ) or pﬁzer ( n ¼72 ) had samples collected at target dates of 0 to 4 days before dose 2 ( relative to dose 1 : 27 days moderna , 20 days pﬁzer ) , 14 64 days after dose 2 ( 42 days moderna , 35 days pﬁzer ) , 30 64 days after dose 2 ( 58 days moderna , 51 days pﬁzer ) , 90 610 days after dose 2 ( 118 days moderna , 111 days pﬁzer ) , and 180 620 days after dose 2 ( 208 days moderna , 201 days pﬁzer ) . after serum was allowed toclot , samples were centrifuged and either analyzed immediately or stored at 4 8c for up to 6 days prior to analysis . participants who self_identiﬁed as immunocompromised and those who did not receive the second dose of vaccine within 7 days of the manufacturer_recommended interval were excluded from the study ( supplemental figure 1 ) . after exclusion , 79 participants given the moderna vaccine and 70 participants given the pﬁzer vaccine remained in the study . any samples drawn outside thetarget collection dates were excluded from analyses of antibody response . one pre–dose 2 specimen with undetectable antibody signal was removed from further analysis because of incompatibil_ ity with log transformation . one participant did not complete the survey and was excluded from analyses involving symptomseverity . convalescent donors serum specimens were collected in gel separator tubes 32 to 54 days after a polymerase_chain_reaction ( pcr ) –conﬁrmed sars__cov_2 infection from 20 unique individuals with a documented positive sars_cov_2 molecular diagnostic result , aliquoted into sealed plastic tubes , and frozen at /c0808c until further use . detection of antibodies to the sars_cov_2 nucleocapsid and spike_proteins samples were analyzed on a roche cobas e801 instrument ( roche_diagnostics , indianapolis , indiana ) using the elecsys anti– sars_cov_2 s ( spike ; 09289267190 ) and anti–sars_cov_2 ( nucleocapsid ; 09203079190 ) electrochemiluminescence immuno_ assays . the roche anti–sars_cov_2 s is a total antibody assay that predominantly quantiﬁes anti–sars_cov_2 immunoglobulin ( ig ) g , but also detects iga and igm antibodies to the spike_protein . it uses a double_antigen sandwich principle similar to the rocheanti–sars_cov_2 nucleocapsid total antibody assay previously described . 15spike antibody results were reported quantitatively ( u/ ml ) with a cutoff for positivity of /c210.8 u/ml . linearity was conﬁrmed up to 250 u/ml , and a 2_ to 100_fold dilution with diluent universal was conducted as necessary to expand the reportable range to 25 000 u/ml . one sample .25 000 u/ml underwent 2 sequential dilution steps to achieve a quantitativeresult . assay imprecision was 4.6 % , 2.5 % , and 2.9 % for a negative patient pool ( 0.61 u/ml ) , positive patient pool ( 17.2 u/ml ) , and quality_control ( 8.7 u/ml ) , respectively , after performing 5 replicates of each per day for 5 days . nucleocapsid antibody results were reported qualitatively with a cutoff index for positivity of /c211.0 . cutoff index and test performance characteristics were described previously . 15 statistical_analysis for each dose and vaccine manufacturer , the prevalence of symptoms ( severity .0 ) was reported as percentages . the signiﬁcance of prevalence and severity associations was interpreted using the effect estimates and 95 % credible intervals estimated 678 arch pathol lab med—vol 146 , june 2022 antibody response after covid_19 mrna vaccines —kelliher et al through multivariable regression modeling procedures . additional details may be found in the supplemental digital content . several ordinal , binomial , and continuous_response multivari_ able regression models were used to estimate the relationshipsbetween symptom severity ( 0–5 ; overall and symptom_speciﬁc ) and antibody signal . dose number , vaccine manufacturer , age , gender , and use of pain relief medication were incorporated in themultivariable models to account for their association with symptomseverity . spike antibody response was log transformed prior to modeling . nonlinear associations with age were evaluated by binning age into 3 categories ( 19–35 , 36–59 , and 60–74 years ) .bayesian hierarchical models were employed to control for potential bias that may arise from a small sample_size and repeat measurements by participant . all multivariable statistical models were ﬁt using brms and rstan via the r statistical software language v3.6 . 19,20antibody response reference intervals for each manufacturer were established using the referenceintervals package as the central 95 % of values generated at each time point.21 the directionality and statistical signiﬁcance of all associations may be found in supplemental tables 2 through 10 , as can the greater details of all the statistical_methods . results participant demographic information more women ( n ¼113 ) than men ( n ¼36 ) participated in this study , but the percentage of women within themoderna group ( 57 of 79 ; 72.2 % ) did not signiﬁcantly differfrom that in the pﬁzer group ( 56 of 70 ; 80.0 % ; supplementaltable 1 ) . the mean age of participants in the moderna ( 45years ) group was skewed slightly older than the pﬁzer ( 41years ) group ( p¼.06 ; supplemental_table 1 ) . three participants tested positive for antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein . the ﬁrst participant ( pﬁzer ) haddetectable nucleocapsid antibodies prior to receivingvaccine dose 1 but did not have any detectable spikeantibodies and did not report a previous infection . this person retained detectable nucleocapsid antibodies at all subsequent collections and displayed a spike antibodyconcentration near the median at each time point . thesecond participant had a known exposure to covid_19 1month prior to the start of the study . this participant ( pﬁzer ) was positive for nucleocapsid antibodies at all timepoints examined and had the highest spike antibodyresponse after dose 1 ( 1253 u/ml ) . a third participant ( moderna ) was nucleocapsid antibody negative beforedose 2 and 14 days after dose 2 but nucleocapsid antibodypositive at 30 days after dose 2 . at the 90_ and 180_day post–dose 2 collection , this participant was negative for nucleocapsid antibodies . this participant ’ s spike antibodyresponse was near the 25th percentile at all time points anddid not show a notable increase following the detection ofnucleocapsid antibodies , suggesting this was a false_positive nucleocapsid result . nucleocapsid antibody resultswere negative for all other participants throughout thestudy and were interpreted to indicate an absence ofprevious infection . because of the low incidence ofnucleocapsid antibody positivity , no comparisons were made between nucleocapsid_positive and nucleocapsid_ negative participants . side_effects after vaccine administration side_effects began within 1 day after vaccination for most participants after both doses 1 and 2 ( data not shown ) .symptoms noted after vaccination , ordered from most toleast common , are shown in figure 1 . overall , participantswho received the moderna vaccine had a more severe reaction than those who received pﬁzer ( figure 1 ) . of the speciﬁc symptoms , sore arm , swelling at the injection_site , chills , and fever were more severe in those receivingmoderna ( figure 1 ) . there was no statistical difference in overall symptom severity between the pﬁzer and moderna groups after dose 1 ( figure 1 ; supplemental_table 2 ) . however , swelling atthe injection_site ( moderna , 19 of 79 ; 24.1 % ; pﬁzer , 7 of 69 ; 10.1 % ) , rash at the injection_site ( moderna , 10 of 79 ; 12.7 % ; pﬁzer , 0 of 69 ; 0 % ; data not shown ) , and fever ( moderna , 2of 79 ; 2.5 % ; pﬁzer , 0 of 69 ; 0 % ) were reported morefrequently and with a higher severity rating in those who received moderna ( figure 1 ) . after dose 2 , 75 of 79 participants ( 94.9 % ) receiving moderna reported a reactioncompared with 60 of 69 ( 87.0 % ) of those who received pﬁzer , and overall symptom severity was signiﬁcantly greater for moderna ( figure 1 ) . sore arm ( moderna , 77 of79 ; 97.5 % ; pﬁzer , 61 of 69 ; 88.4 % ) , swelling at the injectionsite ( moderna , 26 of 79 ; 32.9 % ; pﬁzer , 6 of 69 ; 8.7 % ) , rash at the injection_site ( moderna , 9 of 79 ; 11.4 % ; pﬁzer , 2 of 69 ; 2.9 % ; data not shown ) , body aches ( moderna , 53 of 79 ; 67.1 % ; pﬁzer , 28 of 69 ; 40.6 % ) , chills ( moderna , 38 of 79 ; 48.1 % ; pﬁzer , 18 of 69 ; 26.1 % ) , and fever ( moderna , 36 of 79 ; 45.6 % ; pﬁzer , 10 of 69 ; 14.5 % ) occurred morefrequently and were rated more severely in participantswho received moderna compared with those who received pﬁzer ( figure 1 ; supplemental_table 2 ) . no symptoms were rated more severely in participants receiving pﬁzercompared with those who received moderna . symptoms with low prevalence , including vomiting , gastrointestinal upset , cough , body rash , sweating , lymph node swelling , and unsolicited symptoms ( ‘ ‘ other ’ ’ ) are not displayed in figure 1 . participants in both the moderna and pﬁzer groups reported a statistically signiﬁcant increase in overall sideeffect severity between dose 1 and dose 2 ( figure 1 ; supplemental_table 3 ) . this change in severity from dose 1 to dose 2 was present for overall symptom severity , lethargy , headache , body aches , chills , fever , nausea , andsweating . lethargy and headache demonstrated signiﬁcant_ ly increased severity after dose 2 relative to dose 1 for those who received moderna but did not differ signiﬁcantlybetween dose 1 and dose 2 for pﬁzer ( figure 1 ) . in general , the increase in symptom severity between doses 1 and 2 was greater for those who received moderna than those who received pﬁzer . gender_ and age_related difference in vaccine response overall symptom severity did not differ between women and men ( figure 2 , a ) , but sore arm at injection_site , swelling , nausea , gastrointestinal upset , headache , body aches , and lethargy were reported to be more severe by women ( supplemental_table 4 ) . the severity of symptoms after vaccination was negatively associated with age regardless of vaccine manufacturer or dose ( figure 2 , b ; supplemental_table 5 ) . participants aged36 to 59 years exhibited reduced symptom severity ( dose 1,55 of 67 ; 82.1 % ; dose 2 , 59 of 67 ; 88.1 % ) compared with those aged 35 years and younger ( dose 1 , 53 of 57 ; 93.0 % ; dose 2 , 57 of 57 ; 100 % ) . participants aged /c2160 years trended toward lower symptom severity relative to the /c2035 years group . a total of 17 of 24 participants ( 70.1 % ) aged /c2160 years reported symptoms after dose 1 , whereas 19 of 24 ( 79.1 % ) reported symptoms after dose 2 . this did not reach arch pathol lab med—vol 146 , june 2022 antibody response after covid_19 mrna vaccines —kelliher et al 679 statistical signiﬁcance , likely because of the lower sample_size in the /c2160 years age_group . antibody response after vaccination spike antibody responses before and after vaccination , and in serum from convalescent donors , are shown in figure3 , a . the median antibody response in the moderna group before dose 2 ( 27 days after dose 1 ) was not signiﬁcantly different from the median response in convalescent donors , whereas the median response in the pﬁzer group ( 20 days after dose 1 ) was signiﬁcantly lower ( 95 % ci , 0.117–1.266 ; table ; supplemental_table 6 ) . the median antibodyresponse in both groups of vaccinated participants , up to 180 days after dose 2 ( 208 days moderna , 201 days pﬁzer after dose 1 ) , was signiﬁcantly higher than the antibodyresponse in convalescent donors . the median antibody response after vaccination was higher in participants receiving the moderna vaccine than in those receiving pﬁzer at all measured time points ( 95 % ci , 0.781–1.299 ; figure 3 , a ; supplemental tables 6 and 7 ) . allimmunocompetent participants exhibited a substantial increase in antibody response after the second dose of vaccine , which dropped by 37.1 % for moderna and 31.0 % for pﬁzer from 14 to 30 days after vaccine dose 2 . percentages were determined based on regression modeling and methods for post hoc comparisons between collectiondates in r using the emmeans package ( 95 % ci , 27.5 % – 46.4 % moderna , and 19.2 % –41.9 % pﬁzer ; supplemental_table 9 ) . antibody response continued to decline through_out the study . participants receiving the moderna vaccine series saw an 84 % drop in antibody levels at 180 days relative to 14 days after dose 2 ( 95 % ci , 81.7 % –86.7 % ) .pﬁzer recipients saw a similar reduction in antibody response of 79 % during the same time interval ( 95 % ci , 74.7 % –82.3 % ; supplemental_table 9 ) . p r i o rt od o s e2 , a n t i b o d yr e s p o n s ew a sn e g a t i v e l y correlated with age in recipients of both vaccines ( figure3 , b ; supplemental figure 2 ; supplemental tables 6 and 10 ) . participants aged 60 years or older had a signiﬁcantly lower antibody response than participants aged /c2035 years ( 95 % figure 1 . summary of symptom severity after vaccination . stacked bar

vaccines —kelliher et al ci , 0.426–1.182 ) . this negative correlation was seen for pﬁzer recipients throughout the study ( figure 3 , c throughf ) . however , following dose 2 of the moderna vaccine , there was no correlation between age and antibody response at any of the time points measured ( figure 3 , c through f ) . antibody response did not signiﬁcantly differ between men and women ( supplemental figure 3 , supplemental_table 6 ) . overall symptom severity versus antibody response participants receiving the moderna vaccine reported greater severity of side_effects after vaccination and had consistently higher antibody responses after each vaccine dose . however , no correlation existed between symptomseverity and antibody response that was not accounted for by other confounding factors following dose 1 or dose 2 of the vaccine ( figure 4 ; supplemental_table 7 ) . reference intervals reference intervals for expected antibody response at each time point after vaccination were determined using non_ parametric bootstrapped 95 % credible intervals ( table ) . because of the signiﬁcantly higher antibody response in those who received moderna compared with those who received pﬁzer , separate reference intervals were reported.prior to dose 2 , the reference interval for antibody response was 15 to 1068 u/ml for moderna and 3 to 783 u/ml for pﬁzer . fourteen days after vaccine dose 2 , the referenceinterval for moderna was 1931 to 37 987 u/ml , whereas pﬁzer was 679 to 9420 u/ml . by 180 days , the expectedresponses dropped to 144 to 5792 u/ml and 78 to 1882 u/ml for moderna and pﬁzer recipients , respectively . discussion this study was the ﬁrst to compare both self_reported side_effects and antibody response during the course of 6 monthsafter vaccination with either moderna ( mrna_1272 ) orpﬁzer ( bnt126b2 ) in a single population independent ofmanufacturer oversight . we found that although partici_pants who received moderna had a higher antibodyresponse , they also experienced an increased severity ofside effects , particularly after the second dose . consistentwith previous publications , participants in this studyreported increased side effect severity in both modernaand pﬁzer groups following dose 2 relative to dose 1 , including lethargy , headache , body aches , chills , fever , nausea , and sweating . 5–7,13,22when comparing side_effects after vaccination with either moderna or pﬁzer , thereactions were more severe for those who receivedmoderna , with the difference between manufacturersparticularly evident after dose 2 . this is consistent withprior studies that compared covid mrna vaccinereactogenicity . 9,11,13 participants who received moderna had a higher antibody response than those who received pﬁzer at every time point figure 2 . comparison of overall symptom severity after vaccination by gender and age . stacked bar plots indicating percentages ( y_axis ) and overall severity ratings ( 1–5 ) are shown for participants following doses 1 and 2 ( x_axis ) after either moderna ( top ) or pfizer ( bottom ) vaccination for ( a ) females and males and ( b ) participants aged /c2035 , 36 to 59 , and /c2160 years . a statistically significant reduction in overall symptom severity compared with participants aged /c2035 years is indicated by an asterisk . arch pathol lab med—vol 146 , june 2022 antibody response after covid_19 mrna vaccines —kelliher et al 681 examined during the 6 months following vaccination . each dose of the moderna vaccine contains 100 lg of mrna6,7 and is given 28 days apart , whereas the pﬁzer vaccine contains 30 lg of mrna5and is given 21 days apart . the moderna and pﬁzer vaccines use different rna sequences and the absolute number of mrna copies may not becomparable , but previous studies have shown that immu_ nogenicity to both mrna_1272 and bnt126b2 vaccineswere dose_dependent , with higher doses eliciting a stronger antibody response . 5,7,23,24the cdc also released informa_ tion showing that vaccination with moderna offers greaterprotection against severe infection . 18participants receiving moderna have an additional week to seroconvert after dose 1 , and spike antibody titers rise rapidly over time shortlyafter vaccination . 22therefore , differences in antibody response were likely due to a combination of dosing and figure 3 . spike antibody response after vaccination . a , grouped box and scatter plots representing the median of log_transformed spike antibody response ( y_axis ) at

mrna vaccines —kelliher et al timeline differences between the moderna and pﬁzer vaccines . we observed that older participants exhibited a lower prevalence of side_effects than younger participants and antibody response declined with age , consistent with phase 1 clinical_trials.5,6in pﬁzer recipients , the lower antibody response was observed throughout the 6_month study , consistent with recent publications.25–27because of immu_ nosenescence , older individuals tend to exhibit a suboptimal immune response to vaccination compared with younger individuals , which may contribute to the reduced symptomburden after vaccination.28however , we , like others,26did not observe this negative correlation in moderna recipientsfollowing dose 2 . it is possible that the increased mrnadosage in the moderna vaccine is sufﬁcient to counteract age_dependent differences in immune response . although the exact relationship between spike_protein antibodies andprotection against sars_cov_2 remains to be established , the lower immune response observed in older individuals may be a contributing factor to the higher death rates and disease burden seen after sars_cov_2_infection in thatpopulation . 29 figure 4 . lack of correlation between overall symptom severity and spike antibody response after vaccination . scatter_plot of log_transformed spike antibody response ( y_axis ) is plotted against overall symptom severity score ( x_axis ) after administration of the moderna ( blue ) or pfizer ( red ) va ccine . the pre–dose 2 antibody response is plotted against the overall severity after dose 1 ( a ) , and the 14_day post–dose 2 antibody response is plottedagainst the overall severity after dose 2 ( b ) . arch pathol lab med—vol 146 , june 2022 antibody response after covid_19 mrna vaccines —kelliher et al 683 we predicted that increased symptom severity after vaccination with moderna would correlate with the higher antibody signal , but no such relationship was found . instead , overall symptom severity ratings were independentof antibody response , which agrees with a recent report looking at igg response to the pﬁzer vaccine . 30however , key differences in antibody response after vaccination havebeen observed in speciﬁc populations . a recent meta_analysis demonstrated that in patients being treated for multiple_sclerosis , serum antibody concentrations were approximately 3.25_fold higher in those who received themoderna vaccine relative to those receiving pﬁzer . 31 another study found that in patients being treated bydialysis , a greater percentage of pﬁzer recipients had adiminished antibody response relative to those patients whoreceived the moderna vaccine . 32taken together , our ﬁndings and recently published literature could help selectively target each vaccine to a speciﬁc patient demo_graphic , with moderna preferred in individuals in need of greater immune stimulation ( elderly , immunocompromised , etc ) and pﬁzer preferred in those who are primarilyconcerned about vaccine reactions . antibody response after full vaccination ( 14 days after dose 2 ) with either moderna or pﬁzer was higher than in convalescent donors 32 to 54 days after conﬁrmed infection.in phase 1 clinical_trials of the pﬁzer bnt162b2 vaccine , average igg antibody response to the s_1 binding domain after full vaccination was reported to be higher ( 8147 u/ml ) than antibody titers seen in convalescent donors ( 631 u/ml ) . 5in our study , the median total antibody response after full vaccination with pﬁzer was 2880 u/ml , whereas the response in convalescent donors was 119 u/ml . althoughthe absolute antibody signals differed , likely due to analyticdifferences between platforms , we both observed substan_ tially higher antibody signal in previously seronegative , vaccinated individuals relative to convalescent donors at asimilar time point . future studies should monitor long_term antibody and adaptive immune response in both popula_ tions to determine if vaccination offers longer_term protec_tion than immunity arising from natural infection . previous studies have demonstrated that antibody re_ sponse can vary signiﬁcantly between different analytic platforms . 14,33–35assays can differ by epitope target , immunoassay design , antibody class detected ( igg_speciﬁcversus total antibody ) , detector antibody label , and buffer composition . we reported an expected antibody response for both the moderna and pﬁzer cohorts at each of themeasured time points for the roche anti–sars_cov_2 s assay . it has now been shown that the antibody signal measured by the roche assay does have a slight correlation ( r 2¼0.39 ) with the production of neutralizing_antibodies.14 at present , it is unknown what level of antibody response is considered protective . should measurement of spike anti_ body response be used to assess immune status in thefuture , assay_speciﬁc reference intervals or standardized assay results will be required in addition to vaccine_speciﬁc reference intervals . as the world_health_organization hasrecently released an accepted international standard , effortsto standardize spike antibody assays and develop estab_ lished reference intervals should start to increase . our results can contribute to the large amount of data necessaryto establish these values . we observed a signiﬁcant increase in antibody response from the pre–dose 2 time point to the 14_day post–dose 2time point , followed by a continued decrease in antibodysignal out to the 180_day collection . another group reported a similar median decrease in antibody response of 29.4 % for pﬁzer recipients between samples drawn at 3 and 6 months following vaccination when measured using the rocheassay . 36it is possible that at least a portion of this drop in antibody response is due to the disappearance of the igm and iga antibodies over time . the roche anti–sars_cov_2s assay is a total antibody assay , and although itpredominantly detects igg antibodies , it can also detect igm and iga antibodies . however , 1 study of 41 pﬁzer recipients , where antibodies were measured out to 6months , saw both igm and igg antibodies decrease by 80.9 % and 88.6 % , respectively . 37additional studies using igg_speciﬁc platforms also demonstrated a similar drop inantibody signal , suggesting that a global decline inantibodies is responsible for the decrease . 5,7although antibody signal drops , it is still unknown what values correspond to protection . studies have shown there is aslight correlation with neutralizing_antibody produc_ tion . 14,38–40unfortunately , there is still no consensus on the cutoff for protection . one research study estimates thatthe neutralization level for 50 % protection from severeinfection is only 3 % of the mean convalescent level . 8 although the exact correlation of spike antibody responseto neutralizing_antibodies is unknown , it is promising thatthe median antibody response 180 days after vaccination is approximately 5_ or 10_fold higher than convalescent samples for pﬁzer or moderna recipients , respectively . there are several limitations to our study . the postvac_ cination symptom survey was given to participants at either 14 or 30 days after dose 2 , meaning that some participants completed the survey 2 weeks later than others , potentiallyintroducing recall bias . however , there was no difference inoverall symptom severity between those who answered at 14 days and those who answered at 30 days . although we did not see a trend with symptom severity and antibodyresponse , others have reported a correlation between antibody response and the presence of systemic_reactions to the vaccine . 25,27it might be pertinent to look at whether antibody responses were different in recipients whoreported speciﬁc symptoms versus those who did not . more women than men volunteered for this study , resulting in an uneven gender distribution . our sample_size for participantsaged/c2160 years was limited , which diminished our ability to establish statistically signiﬁcant effects for this group . the age distribution was slightly skewed to younger participantsassigned to the pﬁzer group , but this difference between themoderna and pﬁzer groups was not statistically signiﬁcant ( p¼.06 ) . additionally , the multivariable regression models removed any potential impact of these confounders whenassessing key relationships . because each vaccine group contained fewer than 120 participants at each time point , reference intervals deﬁned here should be consideredpreliminary . the number of participants in our study witha previous or concurrent sars_cov_2_infection was too low to identify differences in vaccine response between previ_ ously infected and uninfected participants . medical historyand race/ethnicity for participants were not recorded in our study because of institutional_review_board constraints . finally , although participants were seemingly healthy , it ispossible that antibody response was affected by underlyingmedical conditions that were not disclosed . the use of commercial sars_cov_2 antibody assays against the spike_protein is not currently approved forassessing the immune status of an individual . however , the 684 arch pathol lab med—vol 146 , june 2022 antibody

covid_19 : perceived infection risk and barriers to uptake of pfizer_biontech and moderna vaccines among community healthcare workers tolulope b. famuyiro1 & abayomi ogunwale1 & jude des bordes1 & mukaila raji2 received : 19 march 2021 / revised : 16 june 2021 / accepted : 21 june 2021 # the author ( s ) 2021 abstract background the health and economic ramifications of the coronavirus pandemic have prompted the need for a timely and effective vaccine development . while the rollout of the covid_19 vaccine in record time is being hailed as a scientific feat , skepticism about the safety , side_effects , and even its long_term effects remain . acceptance of the vaccine may therefore be a challenge among healthcare workers ( hcws ) , whose role is considered a proxy to determining the covid_19 vaccine uptake response by the general population . methods in december 2020 , prior to the arrival and receipt of the pfizer_biontech and moderna covid_19 vaccine , we conducted a cross_sectional survey to assess the readiness for vaccine uptake among hcws at three community_based , university_affiliated health centers . results a total of 205 ( 82 % ) respondents out of 250 completed the questionnaire . fifty_four percent of respondents agreed to receive vaccine once available . females ( odds_ratio ( or ) =0.22 , p=0.014 ) , non_hispanic blacks ( or=0.066 , p=0.010 ) , and hispanics ( or=0.11 , p=0.037 ) were less likely to accept the vaccine . respondents with moderate_risk perception were more likely to accept ( or=2.79 , p=0.045 ) compared to those with low_risk perception while no association was found between high_ risk perception and vaccine acceptance ( p=0.226 ) . after adjusting for perceived risk , sex , race/ethnicity , and age , acceptance in non_hispanic black population remained statistically significant ( adjusted or=0.07 , p=0.014 ) , with hispanic ( aor=0.12 , p=0.051 ) showing a trend . conclusions enthusiastic acceptance of the covid_19 vaccine is lacking among surveyed hcws of certain racial/ethnic groups . provision of resources and public health interventions targeting underserved , minority populations are necessary to halt oppo_ sition to vaccine uptake . keywords covid_19 vaccine .vaccine uptake .vaccine hesitance .healthcare workers .covid_19 introduction in november 2019 , severe_acute_respiratory disease coronavi_ rus 2 ( sars_cov_2 ) emerged from wuhan , china , and rap_ idly spread creating a pandemic known as coronavirus ( covid_19 ) infection . across the world , the usa records the highest confirmed cases and death [ 1–4 ] . the age_specific mortality report published in the journal of the american medical association lists covid_19 infection as one of the top leading causes of death for persons aged 45 and older in the usa [ 5 ] . nationally , the covid_19 pandem_ ic disproportionately harms minorities , with american indian , african_american , and hispanic communities reporting more hospitalizations and deaths [ 4 ] . the health and economic ramifications of the pandemic prompted the need for a timely and effective vaccine develop_ ment . less than a year after the first covid_19 case was identified , two mrna_based vaccines by pfizer_biontech and moderna were developed [ 2,6 ] . following the release of the phase 3 clinical study trial report showing high antibody response , as well as immunogenicity among its recipients , the us food and drug administration granted these two vaccines emergency_use_authorization for active immunization in the usa [ 2,7–12 ] .

time is being hailed as a scientific feat , skepticism about the safety , side_effects , and its long_term effects re_ mains . concerns about politicization of the process have alsobeen expressed , among others . in light of these skepticisms , acceptance of the covid_19 vaccine by those eligible for early vaccination could pose a threat to achieving much_needed national herd_immunity [ 2,8–10,12–18 ] . the vaccine rollout strategy recognized and prioritized healthcare workers to be the first to receive the vaccine , adecision based on the premise that hcws serving in the front_ line of defense against this infection were most at risk of getting and transmitting the virus to others [ 2,8,11,13–17 , 19,20 ] . with reports from older studies showing a low uptake of influenza vaccine among hcws during the h1n1 pandem_ic in 2009 and the knowledge of how vital the role healthcareworkers ( hcws ) play in determining the response of the gen_ eral population towards vaccine acceptance , this study assessed the perceived acceptance readiness of communityhealthcare workers to the pfizer_biontech and moderna vac__cines and to identify factors that influence their decisions [ 21 , 22 ] . we hypothesized that perception of increased risk for covid_19 infection strongly influences the decision ofhcws to receive covid_19 vaccine and that hcws in_ volved in direct patient care are more likely to agree to receive covid_19 vaccine immediately rather than later compared to nonclinical staff . further , that vaccine safety is the most likelyconcern influencing vaccine uptake decision . methods a cross_sectional study was conducted in december 2020 ( prior to the arrival and receipt of the pfizer_biontech andmoderna vaccines ) . a survey was created and individually disseminated among the community clinical and nonclinical hcws of three community_based , university_affiliated healthcenters in houston , texas . the study was approved by the institutional_review_board of the university of texas health science center , houston . demographic informationcollected include age , sex , race , ethnicity , and hcw roles ( divided into four groups : attending_physician , residents , other clinical staff involved in direct patient care ( e.g. , nurses , med_ical assistants , respiratory therapists ) , and others without di_ rect patient care , such as receptionists , administrative person_ nel , and social workers ) . exposure to covid_19 was assessed by a question on whether respondents had contact ( within a 6_ ft distance ) with a covid_19 positive patient or a personunder investigation ( pui ) for the infection or if they had ever tested positive for covid_19 infection . perceived infection risk for covid_19 was assessed with questions “ how do you perceive your risk of getting covid_19 infection ? ” matched with responses : low , moderate , or high risk . the drivers to thedecision to receive the vaccine were obtained with a questionasking whether the respondents ’ perceived risk of getting covid_19 influenced their decision to receive or not receivethe vaccine . in addition , we asked if the decision to receive thevaccine was driven by other factors such as their personal medical history ( such as known history of diabetes , underly_ ing lung , or heart disease ) , work exposure risk , recommenda_tion by the employer , and data from a public health expert , media , family , or colleague . vaccine uptake readiness ( outcome ) was assessed with responses : “ i would like to re_ ceive the vaccine once available , ” “ i would like to receive the vaccine but prefer to wait until later , ” or “ i do not plan on receiving the vaccine . ” also , we gauged their willingness to recommend the vaccine to others on a likert_scale with the question : “ how likely are you to recommend the vaccine to others ? ” finally , barriers and concerns relating to the covid_ 19 vaccine were assessed with a question identifying the is_sue ( s ) most concerning to them about the recently approved covid_19 vaccine . overall data were reported using the frequentist inference while associations between outcomes and the independentvariables were analyzed using logistic_regression . results a total of 205 ( 82 % ) hcws out of 250 completed the ques_tionnaire . respondents were mostly young hcws ages 25 –34 years ( 42 % , n=86 ) , females ( 75 % , n=152 ) , and non_hispanic blacks ( 32 % , n=64 ) . most respondents were clinical staff di_ rectly involved in patient care ( 86 % , n=178 ) . over half of thetotal respondents ( 54 % ) agreed to receive vaccine once they become available while the rest would either wait ( 27.7 % ) or not receive the vaccine at all ( 17.8 % ) .table 1is a summary of the respondents ’ characteristics and vaccine uptake willingness . most physicians ( 83 % ) and residents ( 81 % ) expressed more enthusiasm to receive the vaccine once it became avail_ able compared to other clinical staff ( nurses , medical assistant , clinical technician , etc . ) ( 31 % ) ( figure 1 ) , while 78 % of asians and 71 % of non_hispanic whites were willing to re_ ceive the vaccine as soon as available 46 % of hispanics and 36 % of non_hispanic blacks were willing to do same ( figure 2 ) . respondents 65 years and older were most willing to immediately receive the vaccine ( 86 % ) compared to allother age_groups ( figure 3 ) . among those who were hesitant , nhb constituted 44 % ( n=40 ) , hispanics 34 % ( n=31 ) and10 % ( n=9 ) each for non_hispanic whites and asians . work exposure risk ( 47 % , n=94 ) and data from experts ( 20 % , n=40 ) most influenced hcws ’ vaccine uptake decision ( figure 4 ) , while vaccine safety ( 80 % , n=161 ) and efficacy ( 13 % , n=20 ) served as potential barriers to uptake . sixty_ seven percent of all respondents would recommend the vac__cine to friends and family.1544 j . racial and ethnic health disparities ( 2022 ) 9:1543–1549 table 1 respondents

males ) were less likely to agree to receive the vaccine ( or=0.22 , p=0.014 ) . non_hispanic blacks ( or=0.066 , p=0.010 ) and hispanics ( or=0.11 , p=0.037 ) were less likely to accept the vaccine compared to non_hispanic whites.overall , the perceived risk of getting covid_19 infection did not influence vaccine acceptance . however , respondents with moderate_risk perception were more likely to accept ( or=2.79 , p=0.045 ) compared to those with low_risk percep_ tion while no association existed between high_risk perception and vaccine acceptance ( p=0.226 ) . on adjusting for perceivedrisk , sex , race/ethnicity , and age , only non_hispanic black remained statistically significant ( adjusted or=0.07 , 95 % confidence_interval ( ci ) , 0.01 –0.59 ) , while moderate_risk per_ ception ( adjusted or=3.17 , p=0.055 ) and hispanic ( adjustedor=0.12 , p=0.051 ) showed a trend towards significance.there was no significant association between vaccine uptakeresponse and whether or not hcw provided direct care . discussions almost half of our study respondents ( 45.5 % ) would eithernot receive the pfizer_biontech or moderna vaccines at all , or not receive it immediately . this points to a high level of vaccine hesitancy in a critical group in the vaccine supplychain which , if left unaddressed , may amplify the opposition to the vaccine that may already exist in many communities . the lack of enthusiasm towards the covid_19 vaccine whichhas been widely reported in the public appears to be reflective fig . 2 vaccine acceptance by race/ethnicity fig . 3 vaccine acceptance by age of respondents1546 j . racial and ethnic health disparities ( 2022 ) 9:1543–1549 in the attitude and perception of hcws . it is particularly concerning that the subgroups —blacks and hispanics —with highest rate of vaccine non_acceptance in our study also carrythe highest rate of infection , hospitalization , and death fromcovid_19 [ 23 ] . it was not surprising that there was a high degree of hesitancy among “ other clinical staff ” who were mainly ( 82 % ) non_hispanic black and hispanics . reluctance to receive these vaccines may be driven by doubts about immediate and long_term safety and efficacy , lack of trust in the development process , as well as back_ ground historical vaccine apathy in minority populations . hence , the provision of educational resources to equiphcws about the safety , importance of vaccination , and neg_ ative implication of refusing the vaccine should be implemented . as timing may be crucial to the success of widespread vaccination , the release of vaccine adverse_event report ( vaer ) should not be delayed as this may retard the progres_sion of the decision of those respondents who opted to wait to receive the vaccine to wanting the vaccine earlier . so far , the cdc vaer shows only a few side_effects ranging from head_aches , vaccine injection_site pain , mild to moderate anaphy_ lactic reactions , and death ( n=1000 deaths , 0.003 % ) that were not directly linked to the vaccine [ 18,24 ] . as more postvac_ cination reports reveal non_life_threatening adverse_events , a decrease rate of incidence , prevalence , hospitalization , as well as morbidity and mortality rates of covid_19 infection , thosewho have previously expressed hesitancy may begin to recon_ sider their decisions to receive the vaccine . non_hispanic blacks ( and probably hispanic and female hcws ) were more hesitant towards receiving the covid_19vaccine , a finding which is consistent with prior studies that assessed perception and attitude of hcws in large tertiaryhospitals [ 11,17 ] . this report calls for a need to identify and establish a vaccine champion coalition consisting largely ofminority hcws who can act as a resource and encouragementto their vaccine_hesitant colleagues . another potential ap_ proach to mitigating covid vaccine hesitancy among racialand ethnic minorities is enlisting the support of community stakeholders ( e.g. , religious leaders and others in faith_based organizations ) who have been shown to hold substantial in_ fluence in communities of color [ 25 ] . these community influencers might likely be able to understand how social de_ terminants of health ( e.g. , suboptimal housing , transportation , and health insurance ) might impact vaccine_related decision_ making and what approaches to recommend promoting vac__cine acceptance in the community of colors . finally , there is aneed for more active roles by local business leaders in their communities not just in encouraging and educating their em_ ployees to accept covid vaccines but to provide human andcapital resources ( e.g. , time off , transportation ) to facilitate the process of their employees getting the covid vaccines when they become available ( us department of health and humanservices , january 2021 ) [ 26 ] . regarding the perception of infection risk , respondents with moderate_risk perception who affirmed to getting thevaccine once available were mostly the millennials and likely fall into the category of the presumed healthy population . these respondents perceived risk relied solely on work expo_sure vulnerability , rather than on personal medical history . despite their personal decision to receive or not receive the vaccine , most respondents still strongly agreed to recommendthe covid_19 vaccine to others . as such , utilizing hcws to advocate for early covid_19 vaccination among the public seems like a prudent approach . additionally , the convenienceof receiving two doses of vaccine was not identified as a barrier to uptake , although realistically , receiving one dose over two doses could eliminate production_delivery_administration hurdles and concomitantly increase vaccina__tion coverage . it must be noted that our sample was not reflective of the racial composition of the texas healthcare workforce becausewe recruited willing participants . the possible selection_bias of a convenient sample is a limitation ; however , the diverserepresentation of respondents across all ages , gender , race , and ethnicity strengthens the result . the survey reliance onfig . 4 factors influencing covid_19 vaccine uptake decision1547 j . racial and ethnic health disparities ( 2022 ) 9:1543–1549 self_reported data and small sample_size may have introduced hawthorne bias and limit generalizability . however , the pres_ ence of similarities in findings between our report and priorstudies conducted at a large tertiary institution is a strength [ 11 ] . while these results can not fully explain the drivers of the initial hesitance of community healthcare workers towards the covid_19 vaccine , our report certainly provides insight to inform strategies to promote effective vaccination distribution and administration efforts . future studies on social determi_nants of health ( e.g. , perception of current job_security as hcw , multigenerational housing involving living with vul_ nerable relatives —the elderly and persons on dialysis , percep_ tion of access to ppe at curr ent workplace , quality of healthcare insurance , housing , vaccine_related religious be_lief ) are also needed to further understand their roles as poten_tial drivers of covid vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers . it would also be informative for the current partici_ pants in our study to be reinterviewed 6 months later with anexpanded questionnaire to study , ( a ) concordance of pre_ vaccine answers to the current period of vaccine availability by comparing their answers on willingness to accept the vac_cine to whether they actually receive the vaccines which are now available and ( b ) rate of covid_19 screening , infection , hospitalization and death , and relate the outcomes to prior answers on the perception of risk of being infected with coro_ navirus and willingness to accept covid vaccination.findings from such studies can inform the design and imple_ mentation of public health programs to improve covid vac__cine uptake and mitigate vaccine inertia especially in popula_tions with the highest risk of severe covid_19 —the american indian , african_american , and hispanic communi_ties [ 4 ] . conclusions our report shows a racially disproportionate covid_19 vac_cine uptake perception exists among hcws , particularly thoseof the non_hispanic blacks and hispanic population . despite widespread data and the health implication of these disease , enthusiastic acceptance of the covid_19 vaccine is lackingamong surveyed hcws , in large part due to concerns regard_ ing the safety and side_effects . upholding scientific data report on the efficacy of pfizer_biontech and moderna vaccine andlaunching vaccine champions consisting largely of non_ hispanic black and hispanic hcws could help to rebuild the trust and restore confidence in the vaccine . further , publichealth officials should seek to maintain transparency by expe_ diting the public release of all findings relating to the vaccines . acknowledgements we acknowledge dr. nidia perez ,

commentary the costs of coronavirus vaccines and their pricing donald w light1and joel lexchin2 1school of osteopathic medicine , rowan_university , stratford , nj 08540 , usa 2school of health policy and management , faculty of health , y ork university , t oronto m3j 1p3 , canada corresponding author : donald w light . email : lightdo @ rowan.edu the highly infectious coronavirus has caused a global pandemic of disease and death that , through therapid transmission of mutations like the delta vari_ant , exploits vulnerabilities and inequalities in com_munities , nations and across the world . worse , thepandemic fosters massive unemployment , threatenseconomic growth , increases inequality and incitessocial unrest in a vicious self_reinforcing cycle . 1 because ‘ nobody is safe until everyone is safe ’ andaﬄuent nations can not address this issue alone , covid_19 vaccines need to be as globally aﬀordableand accessible as possible as a public health good tohelp counter this threat to global public health . costis clearly not the only reason that vaccines are notreaching vulnerable populations in low_ and middle_income_countries . other factors such as corrupt pol_ iticians , poor transport links and the inability to maintain a cold_chain are all important contributors.however , even if these were corrected , an unaﬀord_able vaccine is the equivalent of no vaccine for themajority of countries . for this reason , our commen_tary focuses on vaccine costs . more than other medicines , vaccines are regarded as a public health good because they are administered to whole populations to protect them from serious risks of illness or death . as appropriate for a globalpandemic , public funding to corporations has directlyor indirectly ﬁnanced all phases of vaccine research , development , testing and manufacturing , includingthe development of the innovations on which therna platform ( mrna ) and other vaccines arebased . 2billions in funding from taxpayers , multiple branches of the united_states ( usa ) government,3 from the european union ( eu ) and countries such as germany , has been so extensive that there is lit_tle investment or sunk_costs for corporations torecover , except perhaps for those associated withmanufacturing the vaccines themselves . in addition , company costs for liability are minimised , as are thelarge marketing costs typical of pharmaceutical products.if companies primarily only need to recover their manufacturing costs , along with a reasonable proﬁtthat is acceptable to both sellers and buyers , then thequestion is what should a fair vaccine price be ? astrazeneca has said it is selling its oxford_basedvaccine without proﬁt during the global pandemic , but its inter_country price per dose varies – $ 2.15 ineurope , $ 3–4 in the usa and $ 5.25 in south africa – and the lack so far of any independent veriﬁcation of cost 4raises the question of the veracity of its claim . according to a bmj report in january 2021 , moderna and pﬁzer were charging more aﬄuentnations and the eu for their mrna vaccines withprices ranging from $ 14.70 to $ 23.50 a dose . 5do their costs of developing and manufacturing vaccines , net of public subsidies , justify these prices , or are the companies just ‘ making a killing ’ as a recent bmj commentary put it ? 6 as with prices , and contrary to the ethics of vac__cines as a public health good , companies have keptmanufacturing costs for all vaccines secret , and only afew independent studies have researched them indetail . 7our analysis is based on this literature as well as an in_depth investigation done with doctors without borders.8still , lack of company disclosure of costs means that our estimates will remain edu_cated guesses until government purchasers demandevidence of veriﬁable costs . in that case , governmentagencies such as the government accountabilityoﬃce ( usa ) , national audit oﬃce ( uk ) and thecourt of auditors ( eu ) could produce far moreaccurate estimates of vaccine costs . to date , govern_ ments have not taken this step , and manufacturers are being allowed to keep their costs secret on theseglobal public health goods . net costs of manufacturing let us start with what is called the ‘ cost of capital ’ , tobuild , equip and replace over time a large , modern vac__cine plant . based on two large , fully equipped , state_of_journal of the royal society of medicine ; 2021 , vol . 114 ( 11 ) 502–504 doi : 10.1177/01410768211053006 ! the royal society of medicine 2021 article reuse guidelines : sagepub.com/journals_permissions the_art facilities in the usa and eu , the high estimate of the most recent study , when spread out over 100million doses a year and annualised over the life ofthe plant and equipment , comes to only about us $ 0.20 a dose . 8a retroﬁtted factory or a new factory in india or china costs much less,8and major public funding to build , expand , retroﬁt and equip plants for covid_19 vaccines means that companies havelittle or no net investment in manufacturing facilitiesto recover . to this cost , one must add the annual costs of a large , highly skilled and experienced staﬀ.manufacturing modern vaccines is a complex processand requires this type of staﬃng to oversee extensive testing for purity , safety and consistency . based on 100 million_doses a year , staﬃng at us or eu levelscosts about us $ 0.18 a dose , including factory andadministrative overhead . a reasonable estimate forcomparable staﬀ in the developing countryvaccine manufacturers network would be abouthalf or us $ 0.09 a dose . 8 a third cost is the vaccine substance itself . the new york times reported that the substance of the johnson_&_johnson vaccine costs us $ 0.30 a dose.9 other vaccine substances may cost more or less ( seebelow ) . a fourth , so_called ﬁll_and_ﬁnish cost tomake vials ready for shipping is about us $ 0.30for single_dose vials , but half or less for multi_dose vials . 8we estimate ﬁll_and_ﬁnish costs range f r o mu s $ 0 . 1 5t ou s $ 0 . 3 0ad o s e , b a s e do n1 0 0 million_doses a year . adding these costs together , net manufacturing costs for 100 million_doses ready for shippingappear to range from us $ 0.54 to us $ 0.98 a dose.a recent detailed study of adenoviral vector vaccineunit costs ﬁnds them to be substantially lower thanthese estimates . 10the mrna coronavirus vaccines seem to cost less than other vaccines to manufacture , although , as we have pointed out above , they are being sold for more than the price of vaccines madethrough more established manufacturing processes.thenew york times reported that mrna vaccines ‘ are relatively easier to manufacture ’ than live_virusvaccines . 11pﬁzer ’ s senior vice_president described making an mrna vaccine ‘ as a clean , fast processthat required a relatively small footprint to produce many doses ’ 12and a detailed study substantiates her characterisation.13 company executives and experts may claim pro_ duction costs are much greater than our estimates butneed to provide veriﬁable evidence of actual costsminus all forms of ‘ push ’ ( grant , contracts ) or ‘ pull ’ ( patents , advance purchase commitments ) , direct orindirect taxpayer subsidies . 14policy implications this analysis has several important implications.first , given that these cost estimates include the sus_tainability of facilities , production lines , equipmentand all manufacturing personnel , sustainable vaccineprices with a modest proﬁt margin should be margin_ ally more than the production costs for these global public health goods . they should be aﬀordable to allbut the 46 least developed countries . ( dealing withaﬀordability for these countries lies outside thescope of this essay . ) second , our cost estimates add support to low estimated costs by others . for example , anamerican group focused on increasing access to hiv medications , concluded it would cost the united_states us $ 2.00 a dose to produce a globalsupply of the moderna vaccine from us public–pri_vate manufacturing facilities . 15at e a mf r o m imperial_college london has modelled the costsfor setting up a global network of facilities to pro_duce eight billion mrna covid_19 vaccineswithin a year . 13it details why all capital , personnel and material costs for moderna ’ s mrna vaccine add up us $ 2.85 a dose . however , becausepﬁzer ’ s vaccine uses much less mrna and manyfewer production lines , personnel and otherr e s o u r c e s , i t sc o s t sa d du pt oo n l yu s $ 1 . 1 8adose . the study also explains how the mrna man_ufacturing process minimises future costs in mod_ifying vaccines to deal with threatening mutations like the delta variant . finally , companies are already increasing prices to wealthy buyers . an august report claims thatpﬁzer has raised its reported price in largeeuropean purchase agreements to $ 25.15 a doseand moderna to $ 25.50 . 16companies expect to charge many times more after they exercise theirright to declare the pandemic is over . 17these higher prices , despite discounts and tiered pricing for middle_ and lower_income countries , are likelyto prolong the global pandemic . governments con_tinue to ﬁnance most future research and develop_ment for coronavirus vaccines and underwrite therisk that companies take through large , heavilyredacted advanced purchase agreements . 4 governments must stop being partners in secrecy , and as purchasers they should demand public , veriﬁable reports on net costs , after direct andindirect taxpayers ’ subsidies , in order to set glo_bally aﬀordable cost_plus prices for these globalpublic health goods . until that happens , the ques_tion will be raised about whether both govern_ments and companies are committing ‘ crimesagainst humanity ’ . 6light and lexchin 503 declarations competing interests : the author ( s ) declared the following potential conﬂicts of interest with respect to the research , author_ship , and/or publication of this article : donald light has no inter_ ests to declare . in 2017–2021 , joel lexchin received payments for writing a brief in an action for side eﬀects of a drug for michael f.smith , lawyer and a second brief on the role of promotion in generating prescriptions for goodmans llp . he is a member of the foundation board of health action international . he receivesroyalties from university of toronto press and james lorimer & co. ltd. for books he has written . funding : none declared . ethics approval : not applicable . guarantor : dwl . contributorship : dwl conceived of the paper and wrote the ﬁrst draft as well as some of the revisions . jl made substantialrevisions , added new references , and shaped the structure of the paper . acknowledgements : dwl wishes to thank drs . stephen scheinthal and thomas cavalieri for encouraging this work . provenance : not commissioned ; peer_reviewed by els torreele , neil snowise , and gayle delong . orcid ids : donald w light https : //orcid.org/0000_0002_ 3233_676x joel lexchin https : //orcid.org/0000_0001_5120_8029 references 1 . sedik ts and xu r. a vicious cycle : how pandemics lead to ecconomic despair and social unrest . international_monetary_fund . see https : //www.imf . org/en/publications/wp/issues/2020/10/16/a_vicious_cycle_how_pandemics_lead_to_economic_despair_and_ social_unrest_49806 ( 2020 , last accessed 1 october 2021 ) . 2 . allen a . for billion_dollar covid vaccines , basic gov_ ernment_funded science laid the groundwork . scientific_american 2020 ; 323 , https : //www.scientificamerican . com/article/for_billion_dollar_covid_vaccines_basic_gov_ ernment_funded_science_laid_the_groundwork/ ( 2020 , last accessed 1 october 2021 ) . 3 . sekar k. domestic funding for covid_19 vaccines : an overview . washington , dc : congressional research service , 2021 . 4 . boulet p , ‘ t hoen e , perehudoff k , mara k and tan e. advanced purchase agreements for covid_19 vaccines : analysis and comments . 2021 ( july ) . brussels : study for the left in the european parliament . see https : //left.eu/issues/publications/eu_vaccine_deals_with_big_pharma_ failed_to_protect_the_public_interest_study/ ( 2021 , last accessed 1 october 2021 ) . 5 . dyer o. covid_19 : countries are learning what others paid for vaccines . bmj 2021 ; 372 : n281.6 . hassan f , yamey g and abbasi k. profiteering from vaccine inequity : a crime against humanity ?

safety and efficacy of coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid_19 ) vaccine in older_adults have been eagerly anticipated owing to the 23_fold greater risk of death due to covid_19 in adults over 65 years_of_age [ 1 ] . maheshi ramasamy and colleagues [ 2 ] have recently presented the safety and immunogenicity of azd1222 ( previously chadox1_ncov_19 ) , the covid_19 vaccine candidate of astrazeneca/oxford , including adults aged 70 years and more . the vaccine seems to be better tolerated in older_adults , exhibiting similar immunogenicity , irrespective of age , following the booster dose [ 2 ] . the inclusion of older adult populations in the vaccine trials help to understand how health status and frailty can influence vaccine efficacy , safety , immunogenicity , and reactogenicity in older_adults [ 3 ] . the plan of astrazeneca to expand their manufacturing capacity to 3 billion doses in 2021 is a major step in attaining 100 % global vaccination coverage [ 4 ] . this correspondence aims to analyze the major covid_19 vaccines developed by astrazeneca/oxford , pfizer/biontech , and moderna , in terms of safety , efficacy , cost , storage , and transportation . 1 . vaccine efficacy and safety the replication_defective viral vector ( adenovirus ) vaccine of astrazeneca/oxford has exhibited an average efficacy of 70.4 % [ 4,5 ] , whereas that of the mrna vaccine candidate developed by pfizer/biontech ( bnt162b2 ) was estimated at 95 % , following the conclusion of phase_iii trial [ 6 ] . the latter team have already applied to us_fda for emergency_use authorization [ 7,8 ] . almost similar efficacy was also exhibited ( 94.1 % ) by mrna_1273 , the mrna vaccine candidate developed by the us biotech company moderna [ 9,10 ] . the efficacy of astrazeneca/oxford vaccine was evaluated in participants aged 18 years and older . the randomized controlled trial conducted across brazil , uk , and south africa , confirmed the safety and efficacy of azd1222 against symptomatic covid_19 [ 5 ] . the astrazeneca/oxford covid_19 vaccine was found to possess similar immunogenicity across all age_groups following the booster dose [ 2 ] . similarly , the randomized controlled trial conducted to evaluate the efficacy of pfizer/biontech vaccine ( bnt162b2 ) enrolled 43,548 participants having 16 years_of_age or more [ 6 ] . the studies conducted among the younger and older_adults have already established the immunogenicity and safety profile of the pfizer/biontech vaccine [ 11,12 ] . the randomized controlled trial that confirmed the efficacy of moderna vaccine ( mrna_1273 ) enrolled 30,420 participants aged 18 years and older [ 10 ] . furthermore , the phase 2 trial that evaluated the safety and immunogenicity confirmed robust immune responses without any adverse_effects in healthy adults vaccinated with the mrna_1273 vaccine . the vaccine also exhibited similar immunogenicity in younger ( 18–55 years ) and older ( ≥55 years ) adults [ 13 ] . 2 . storage and logistics although the average efficacy of astrazeneca/oxford covid_19 vaccine candidate , azd1222 , is lower than those produced by moderna and pfizer/biontech , its recommended storage conditions are worth consideration ( fig . 1 ) [ 4,8,14 ] . pfizer/biontech requires temperature_controlled shippers for transporting vaccines at the recommended storage temperature of −70 °c ± 10 °c for up to 15 days . after thawing , the vaccine can only be stored at refrigerated conditions ( 2–8 °c ) for up to 5 days [ 8 ] . the mrna vaccine candidate of moderna can remain stable at refrigerated conditions ( 2–8 °c ) for 30 days ; it can be stored for 6 months at −20_°c [ 14 ] . however , azd1222 ncov_19 can be transported , stored , and distributed at refrigerated conditions ( 2–8 °c ) for a minimum of six months using existing healthcare settings [ 4 ] . pfizer , the manufacturer of bnt162b2 , has recently submitted data to the fda that supports the use of their vaccine under more flexible conditions . the proposed alternative temperature requirements for the transportation and storage ( −25 °c to −15 °c for up to 2 weeks ) will allow the undiluted vials to be stored without the need for ultra_low cold_storage equipments [ 15 ] . f1_15 fig . 1. : comparison of covid_19 vaccine candidates manufactured by astrazeneca/oxford , moderna , and pfizer/biontech . the figure is created using biorender.com . 3 . cost of vaccine per dose since astrazeneca/oxford used a less expensive technology for the production of azd1222 , the total price per dose is less ; it is the cheapest , at just 3–4 usd per dose , compared to the rest ( moderna , 32– 37 usd and pfizer/biontech , 19.50 usd ) [ 16 ] . fig . 1 illustrates the comparison of covid_19 vaccine candidates manufactured by astrazeneca/oxford , moderna , and pfizer/biontech in terms of efficacy , storage_requirements , and cost . 4 . vaccination in low_ and middle_income_countries following the reports of high efficacy , several countries , especially the wealthier ones , have already started pre_order/purchase of billions of covid_19 vaccine doses triggering a “ global vaccine race ” . the uk government has already pre_ordered five million_doses of mrna_1273 vaccine from moderna , this being its seventh deal with different pharmaceutical companies for securing early doses of the vaccine [ 9 ] . the total_number of covid_19 vaccine doses administered by different countries is illustrated in fig . 2 ( updated on march 18 , 2021 ) . among the countries , the usa occupies the top position with the administration of 118.31 million_doses , followed by china ( 64.98 million ) , india ( 42.06 million ) , the us ( 28.27 million ) , and brazil ( 13.34 million ) . however , in terms of the population that has received at least one dose , israel tops the list with 59.6 % , followed by uk ( 38.7 % ) , chile ( 29.1 % ) , bahrain ( 23.3 % ) , and the usa ( 23.1 % ) [ 17 ] . although india occupies the third position in terms of the total dose administered , it constitutes only about 2.5 % of the total population [ 17 ] . f2_15 fig . 2. : total_number of covid_19 vaccine dose administered as on march 18 , 2021 . reproduced from our world in data ( https : //ourworldindata.org/covid_vaccinations ) under cc by license . several governments and research institutes have already invested both efforts and finances into developing vaccines that can protect their citizens from the virus . although the process of vaccine development and evaluation seems to be rapid , very little is known about the logistics and implementation strategies required for vaccinating billions of people worldwide , especially in low_ and middle_income_countries . success of a vaccine depends on the global vaccination coverage and its efficacy in inducing protective immunity . with limited access to advanced storage and logistic facilities , along with dearth of funds , attaining successful vaccine_induced heard immunity is obviously a challenge for low_ and middle_income_countries . covax is a global alliance initiated to provide such countries equitable access to effective and safe vaccines . however , they could only secure vaccines for 250 million people , much less than the actual requirement , thereby limiting the accessibility of poor countries to the vaccines [ 18 ] . covax intends to purchase two billion doses of covid_19 vaccine by the end of 2021 . this vaccine dose will only cover about 20 % of the participating country 's population . therefore , the doses available with covax will be sufficient to vaccinate healthcare workers and the elderly [ 19 ] . although moderna and pfizer have not announced the supply of vaccines to covax , astrazeneca has already committed to providing vaccines to this cause [ 19 ] . the requirement of specific cold_chain conditions for the storage and transport of vaccines manufactured by moderna and pfizer/biontech might prevent the low_ and middle_income_countries from using these vaccines through covax [ 19 ] . achieving global vaccination coverage will be a challenge as it involves manufacturing billions of doses , coordinating storage , logistics , and equitable distribution of vaccines . therefore , the low_ and middle_ income countries should focus on vaccinating the priority population ( key workers/clinically vulnerable groups/elderly groups ) , since the available doses of vaccines will be insufficient to vaccinate the whole population . 5 . conclusion the choice of vaccine for the immunization program depends on the availability , cost , efficacy , storage , and logistic requirements [ 20,21 ] . despite their high efficacy , the recommended storage conditions of vaccines from moderna and pfizer/biontech make it difficult for the low_ and middle_income_countries to store , transport , and distribute them . on the contrary , astrazeneca/oxford offers an effective covid_19 vaccine candidate for resource_constrained countries that is safe , immunogenic , cost_effective , and can be transported , stored , and distributed at refrigerated conditions . furthermore , the governments have to establish policies on covid_19 vaccination depending on their ability to procure vaccine doses . the low_ and middle_income_countries should focus on vaccinating the key workers/clinically vulnerable groups/elderly . this will enable them to protect the older_adults who are at greater risk of death due to covid_19 . it is also recommended that the vaccination should be offered initially to the essential workers , especially frontline healthcare workers . therefore , the low_ and middle_income_countries should attempt to use the available resources ( vaccines ) in the existing healthcare settings ( storage and logistics ) to the best . ethical approval not applicable . sources of funding none to be stated . author contribution all authors contributed equally _

which is rare , has been reported after covid_ 19 vaccina _ tion , but its management is not standardized . method : members of the european network for drug allergy and the european academy of allergy and clinical immunology interested in drug allergy participated in an online questionnaire on pre_ vaccination screening and management of allergic_reactions to covid_ 19 vaccines , and literature was analysed . results : no death due to anaphylaxis to covid_ 19 vaccines has been confirmed in scientific_literature . potential allergens , polyethylene glycol ( peg ) , polysorbate and tromethamine are excipients . the authors propose allergy evaluation of persons with the following histories : 1— anaphylaxis to injectable drug or vaccine containing peg or derivatives ; 2— anaphylaxis to oral/topical peg containing products ; 3— recurrent ana _ phylaxis of unknown cause ; 4— suspected or confirmed allergy to any mrna vaccine ; and 5— confirmed allergy to peg or derivatives . we recommend a prick_ to_ prick skin test with the left_ over solution in the suspected vaccine vial to avoid waste . prick test panel should include peg 4000 or 3500 , peg 2000 and polysorbate 80 . the value of in vitro test is arguable . 13989995 , 2022 , 8 , downloaded from https : //onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/all.15241 by university of illinois at , wiley_online

19 pan _ demic and public health crisis . covid_ 19 vaccination is a major global preventive measure in the fight against sars_ cov_ 2 , and since december 2020 , many million_doses of various vaccines have been administered globally . several vaccines have been developed , all in less than one year , and some of them use a technology not previously used in vaccine manufacturing . this means that experi _ ence about short_ and long_ term adverse_effects , including the risk of allergic_reactions , is limited . the covid_ 19 vaccines used are based on different vaccine platforms1 _ 1 1 ( table 1 ) . the different platforms are based on nucleic_acids , artificial vectors or recombinant viruses , virus protein sub _ units or disabled ( live attenuated or inactivated ) viruses . the innovative platform based on messenger ribonucleic_acid ( mrna ) encoding spike_protein that is encapsulated in lipid nanopar _ ticles containing lipids and polyethylene glycol ( peg ) is used in the production of the pfizer_ biontech ( with peg 2000 ) , moderna ( with peg 2000 ) and curevac cvncov vaccines.1,3,4 recombinant viruses with coronavirus dna coding for spike_protein on an adenovirus backbone are non_ replicating adenovirus vectors . the adenovirus can be from a strain that infects humans , as in gam_ covid_ vac ( sputnik v ) from russia5 or one that infects other species , such as the chimpanzee adenovirus used in vaxzevria® manufactured by astra zeneca and the university of oxford.6 the janssen johnson_&_johnson covid_ 19 vaccine uses an adenovirus 26 vector.7,8 protein subunit vaccines based on virus_ like particles of protein subunits like for a spike pre_ fusion protein as in the adjuvanted recombinant pro_ tein nanoparticles used in the novavax vaccine ( medicago ) .9 coronavac® ( sinovac ) is a based on virus production from vero cells , then inactivated and absorbed on aluminium hydroxide.10 using peg in vaccines is novel and peg with a molecular weight of 2,000 ( peg 2000 ) serves as a stabilizer to prevent premature deg _ radation of the nanoparticles in the pfizer_ biontech and moderna vaccines.2 other excipients of allergologic interest include tromethamine in the moderna vaccine , aluminium hydroxide in the coronavac vaccine , disodium edta in the astrazeneca vaccine , polysorbate 80 ( ps80 ) in the astrazeneca , janssen and novavax vaccines and polysorbate 20 in the sanofi pasteur/gsk vaccine.1,2 the novavax vaccine contains an adjuvant called matrix m™ that consists of two 40_ nm_ sized particles , the matrix_ a and matrix_ c particles formed by formulating purified saponin from the tree quillaja saponaria molina with cholesterol and phospholipid.9 severe allergic_reactions to vaccines are very rare and can be caused by the vaccine itself or its excipients.1 1 _ 1 4 in december 2020 , the first cases of anaphylaxis were reported after the pfizer_ biontech covid_ 19 mrna vaccination , but no deaths as a result of anaphylaxis have been reported so far in the scientific_literature.15,16 the incidence of anaphylaxis following pfizer_ biontech covid_ 19 vaccination has been reported to be 11.1 per million_doses admin _ istered , about 10_ fold higher than for other vaccines.15,16 the inci _ dence of covid_ 19 vaccine anaphylaxis was estimated at 7·91 cases per million_doses.17 the mechanisms behind these reactions are unclear unknown , but the excipients have been suggested as a potential cause , in particular peg_ 2000.1 8 _ 2 1 a center for disease control ( cdc ) re _ port on the moderna vaccine suggests an incidence of anaphylaxis of 2.5 per million cases.22 for reactions to both mrna vaccines , there was a very strong female predominance possibly reflect _ ing that initial vaccination schemes primarily included healthcare workers . symptom onset was within 10– 15 min in the majority of cases and commonly manifest as diffuse or generalized rashes , periorbital oedema , tongue swelling and feeling of throat clo _ sure.15,16 the paul_ehrlich institute ( pei ) in january 2021 received reports of 17 patients in germany with anaphylactic reactions to mrna vaccines , and all survived the reactions without harm.2 in the majority of reported reactions to the mrna vaccines , there was a history of unspecified allergy to either food , drugs , insects , other vaccines , etc. , but the clinical significance of this anamnestic data is uncertain . in march 2021 , in france there were 159 cases of anaphylaxis ( grades i or ii ) after 6 282 094 injected doses of the pfizer_ biontech vaccine , that is a n i n c i_d e n c e o f 2 . 5 3 / 1 0 0 000.23 in the uk , 246 severe anaphylaxis reactions were reported in march 2021 after 13.6 million of pfizer_ biontech doses ( 1.89 reports/100 000 doses ) .24 with the astra zeneca vaccine , in march 2021 , in australia , 5 cases of anaphylaxis occurred after more than 20 000 doses admin _ istered,25 in france , the incidence was 0.6 /100 000 after 1 430 790 doses,23 and in the uk , 390 cases were reported among 15.8 million_doses administered ( incidence 2.47 /100 000 ) .24 it is important to consider that adverse_reactions to the vaccines including suspected allergic_reactions are scored using the brighton collaboration case definition , developed specifically for adverse re _ actions to vaccines.26 this system has not traditionally been used to classify anaphylaxis to other causes and may overestimate the conclusions : these recommendations will lead to a better knowledge of the manage _ ment and mechanisms involved in anaphylaxis to covid_ 19 vaccines and enable more people with history of allergy to be vaccinated . keywords allergy test , anaphylaxis , covid_ 19 vaccine , mrna vaccines , risk

allergists all over the world are confronted with referrals of pa _ tients with suspected allergic_reactions to the vaccines , and with pre_ vaccination concerns about the risk of allergic_reactions to covid_ 19 vaccination , both from patients and healthcare workers . it is essential that we share our knowledge across borders so that we can utilize the experience of others and ensure that as many peo _ ple as possible can receive the vaccine . there is an urgent need for recommendations to specify clearly , which patients require precau _ tions for covid_ 19 vaccination . the eaaci research and outreach committee has recently published a statement on the diagnosis , management , acute treatment and prevention of severe allergic re _ actions to covid_ 19 vaccines27 stating that unless the patient has a history of an allergic_reaction to any of the vaccine components , there is no contraindication to administer the currently approved covid_ 19 vaccines . there is a need for recommendations for aller _ gological work_ up to determine the mechanisms behind reactions . in order to reach a consensus as large as possible , an online question _ naire was prepared and sent by email to european experts in the field of drug allergy concerning the management of patients with history of severe allergy and patients with a suspicion of hypersensitivity to any covid_ 19 vaccine . through the synthesis of data from the rapidly expanding literature1,2,27_ 29 and the analysis of the survey , the objective was to provide harmonized practical recommendations for the management of patients suffering from allergy or having a suspicion of hypersensitivity to covid_ 19 vaccines . the objectives of this paper are to suggest a harmonized ap _ proach and recommendations for the management of patients with allergy related to covid_ 19 vaccination . these recommendations are based on data from the rapidly expanding literature,1,2,27_ 29 the experience of the authors of the paper and a survey sent to members of the european network of drug allergies ( enda ) , the board of the eaaci drug allergy interest group ( daig ) and eaaci executive committee . 2 | methods a pubmed search has been done with the name of each vaccine likely to be available for use in europe and the following terms # covid_ 19 vaccine allergy , # covid vaccine hypersensitivity , # covid_ 19 vaccine hypersensitivity , # covid_ 19 vaccine adverse_effects , # polyethyleneglycol hypersensitivity and # polysorbate hypersensitivity . all papers concerning anaphylaxis reactions or hypersensitivity reactions to covid_ 19 vaccines have been ana _ lysed . the literature analysis was stopped in april and then com _ pleted in july following the eaaci executive committee advice and recommendations . an online survey was conducted . an online questionnaire was prepared by the members of the board of the eaaci drug allergy interest group ( daig ) , then sent by email to all members of the european

executive committee in february 2021 . the question _ naire included 32 questions relating to the available vaccines , how administered , in which location ( dedicated clinic or department , vaccination centre ) , the existence of national recommendations for vaccination of allergic patients , the profile of the patients for whom allergy consultation was requested before vaccina _ tion , the management and allergy work_ up in the event of an al _ lergic reaction after a first injection of a covid_ 19 vaccine ( on line_ depository ) . from the results of the survey and analysis of the literature , we have proposed updated and detailed recommendations for vaccina _ tion of patients with history of allergy . in addition , we have suggested allergology work_ up for patients with a suspicion of sensitization to vaccine excipients ( primarily pegs or ps ) or with a hypersensitiv _ ity to a covid vaccine . following the analysis of the results of the allergy work_ up , an algorithm with practical recommendations for continuing the vaccination procedure was written , updated finally endorsed by all participants in april 2021 , who are the co_ authors . these recommendations were updated and corrected after a review and advice of the eaaci excom in july 2021 . 3 | results 3.1 | literature analysis : characteristics of excipients in covid_ 19 vaccines and their allergenic potential 3.1.1 | polyethylene glycols peg , also called peg or macrogols ( e1521 ) , are manufactured by polymerization of ethylene oxide with water . they are amphiphilic linear polymers , consisting of a repeating unit of ethyleneoxide ( _ o_ ch2 _ ch2 ) . in drug formulation , the term macrogol or ‘ peg ’ is used in combination with a numerical value , indicating their mean molecular weight ( mw ) .30 pegs with a mean mw up to 400 are liq _ uids , pegs with 1000 to 2000 mw are viscous and above 3000 mw , pegs are in solid form . all pegs are soluble in water . in cosmetics , a different nomenclature is used and the number of a peg refers to the average number of ethylene oxide units ( mw = 44 ) . thus , the same peg may be called peg 3350 ( approximately 75 × 44 ) in a drug or peg 75 in cosmetics.30 peg_ 2000 in drugs is called peg_ 40 in cosmetic nomenclature . peg derivatives are also widely used , and cross_ sensitization has been suggested between pegs , polysor _ bates ( ps ) and poloxamers.30 they include peg ethers , peg fatty_acid esters , peg amine ethers , peg castor_oil , peg_ propylene glycol copo _ lymers , peg sorbitans ( ps ) and peg soy sterols . peg ranges in molecular weight from 200 to 35 00030 pegs under 400 mw are absorbed through intact gastrointestinal mu _ cosa , but less than 10 % of peg 3300 mw are absorbed . only pegs under 3350 mw are absorbed through intact skin . there are reports of contact_dermatitis due to peg derivatives such as peg_ 22/do _ decyl glycol copolymer.3 1 _ 3 3there is no evidence of cross_ reactivity with propyleneglycol or polypropyleneglycol.34 peg hypersensitivity may be provoked via multiple_exposure routes including oral , intramuscular , intra_ articular and intravenous . patients may also report immediate skin symptoms on exposure to skin care products especially if applied on broken skin such as during shaving.30 anaphylaxis to peg contained in laxatives/colonic preparations , aperients , depot steroid injections , tablets or linked to other ther _ apeutic enzymes or proteins such as pegylated asparaginase have recently been reported.3 0 , 3 5 _ 3 9 contact_dermatitis induced by peg seems to be rare . even in a population with a high risk of contact_dermatitis , as patients with chronic leg ulcers , peg seldom induce sensitization . among 309 pa _ tients with chronic leg ulcers , only two ( 0.6 % ) had a positive patch_test , and in another series , patch_test to peg glycol 6 and 32 was positive in 3/423 cases ( 0.7 % ) .40,41 the immunological mechanisms involved in peg and ps anaphylaxis are poorly understood.16,30,42_ 44 an ige_ mediated mechanism has been suggested.16,30,45_ 48 anti_ peg immunoglob _ ulin g ( igg_ peg ) have been detected in patients receiving peg_ conjugated therapeutic proteins,36 but have not been studied in cases of unconjugated peg anaphylaxis.46 an ti _ p e g ig e and igg have recently been reported in patients with severe reactions to peg contained in injectable drugs , using a sensitive technique based on flow_cytometry.47 these anaphylactic mechanisms may be related to direct activation of the classical complement path _ way by igm or igg_ peg resulting from mast_cell activation via the c3a and c5a complement fractions ( complement activation_ related pseudoallergy , carpa ) .46,48,49 recently , carp a has been demonstrated for pegylated nanodrugs.44,50 pegylated nanod _ rugs can activate the complement pathway , c3a and c5a binding to anaphylatoxin receptors can induce mast_cell degranulation . moreover , pegylated nanoparticles through their direct link to pattern_recognition receptors may have a synergistic effect for mast_cell degranulation.44,50 3.1.2 | polysorbates ps 80 is commonly used in food , cosmetics and drug formulations as a solubilizer , stabilizer or emulsifier.51 ps 80 is a non_ ionic , hydro _ philic polyethoxylated surfactant , also called ps 80 , e433 , tween 80 , polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate . it is a fatty_acid ester of polyoxyethylenesorbitan . ps 20 and 60 ( tween 20 and 60 ) are also included in this family of surfactants . cremophor_ el ( crel =polyoxyethylated castor_oil in 50 % ethanol ) activate the complement system in vitro , in normal human serum and plasma . crel and ps 80 activate the complement system to a similar extent . therapeutic side_effects , such as acute hypersensitivity and systemic immunostimulation , caused by intravenous medicines con _ taining polyethoxylated detergents , can be attributed to complement activation_ derived inflammatory mediators.52 ige_ mediated reactions 13989995 , 2022 , 8 , downloaded from https : //onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/all.15241 by university of illinois at ,

corticosteroids have also been reported.42 cross_ sensitization in the skin tests between ps 80 and peg with positive prick_tests to ps 80 and peg have been re _ ported,18,45 this was the case in a teenager who developed anaphylaxis after the first injection of omalizumab which contains ps 20.53 polyoxyl castor_oil ( polyethoxylated castor_oil , kolliphor el , crel ) is prepared by reacting ethylene oxide with castor_oil in a ratio of 35:1 ; thus , it is a peg . it is used as a pharmaceutical solvent for many drugs , such as ciclosporin , and also co_ administered with anti _ cancer drugs , such as paclitaxel . serious forms of hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in a number of medicines containing non_ ionic polyethoxylated sur _ factants , including paclitaxel with crel , docetaxel , erythropoietin , human papillomavirus vaccine with ps8042,54,55 and intravenous fosaprepitant.51 3.1.3 | disodium edta disodium edta , a polyamino carboxylic_acid , is contained in astra zeneca vaccine . edta salts have applications in foods , manufactur _ ing , cosmetics , and pharmaceuticals as preservatives and stabiliz _ ers . contact_dermatitis to edta has been reported with cosmetics and contact_lens solution.56 anaphylaxis to edta seems rare but has been reported . basophil activation tests ( bat ) were positive to edta in a patient with anaphylaxis to radiocontrast media and local anaesthetics all containing edta as excipient.54 the idt with edta at 0.3 mg/ml was positive.56 3.1.4 | trometamol , tromethamine trometamol or tri_ ( hydroxymethyl ) aminomethane is used to pre _ vent the formation of uric_acid and cystine stones , and it is also used as excipient in drugs ( nsaids , contrast media for ct and mri scans ) . it is contained in moderna mrna vaccine . ketorolac tromethamine can induce anaphylaxis ; one case tested positive in idt from 0.01 to 1 mg/ml ( 3 negative controls ) .57 no idt with pure trometamol has been done.57,58 in our experience , trometamol can be a skin irritant . prick test with trometamol at 16.5 mg/ml induces false_ positive re _ sults but seems specific at 1.65 mg/ml ( 10 negative controls ) . 3.2 | results of the online survey the survey concluded at the end of february 2021 , and we received 64 answers from 19 countries : austria ( 1 ) , czech republic ( 2 ) , denmark ( 1 ) , germany ( 4 ) ,

switzerland ( 3 ) , sweden ( 2 ) and uk ( 4 ) . a summary of the main findings at the end of february 2021 is listed below . detailed results can be found in the online deposit.analysis of 62 returns , most centres and countries have available the pfizer biontech ( 92.2 % ) , moderna ( 84.4 % ) and astrazeneca ( 84.4 % ) vaccines . only few countries had other adenovirus vector janssen ( 6 ; 3 % ) or sputnik v ( 1.6 % , 1 centre in serbia ) or protein sub _ unit vaccine sinovac ( 9 % of the centres , only in turkey and serbia ) . in most countries , vaccination can be done in a vaccination cen _ tre ( vc ) outside of a hospital ( 55 , 85.9 % ) . vaccination in a hospital setting is possible in 71.9 % of the centres ( 46/62 ) and for health _ care workers only in 4 more centres . vaccination in a hospital setting for any patients is possible only for a limited number of centres ( 18 , 28.1 % ) . vaccination in an allergy clinic setting is possible only for 19 centres ( 29.7 % ) . vaccination can also be done in nursing homes , primary_care centres , senior residences and family care physician ’ s office . vaccinating people with a history of allergies or to manage hy _ persensitivity reactions to covid_ 19 vaccine , out of the 64 returns , 54.7 % replied that national recommendations were available , but only a limited number of countries had published recommendations , such as in germany2 or uk.59 in patients with a history of only skin symptoms to a non__covid vaccine , 36/62 ( 58.1 % ) participants consider that vaccination can be done in a vaccination centre , but the majority advised extending the observation time to 30– 60 min , 27.4 % suggested that vaccination should be performed in an allergy clinic setting and 14.5 % suggested immunization in a hospital vc . in patients who develop grade_ii or higher anaphylactic reactions , after a non__covid vaccine 46/62 ( 74.2 % ) returns recommended to vaccinate in a hospital vc , preferably in an allergy department for 43.5 % of the participants and only 25.8 % suggested vaccination in a vaccination centre . in a patient with a history of anaphylaxis after administration of an injectable drug , where peg , or ps as ingredients can not be ex _ cluded ( e.g . drug not known sufficiently to get drug leaflet ) , 53/59 ( 89.8 % ) of the centres recommended a vaccination in a hospital vc , in an allergy department in 71.2 % . in a patient with a history of anaphylaxis after administration of an injectable drug that does not contain peg , ps or tromethamine , 32/62 ( 51.6 % ) recommended vaccination in any vaccination centre . in a patient with a history of anaphylaxis after administration of a non__covid vaccine or due to an injectable drug , in case of vaccina _ tion

anaphylaxis with ( ad _ ditional ) extracutaneous involvement of unknown cause ( idiopathic anaphylaxis ) , the breakdown from 59 answers to the question whether covid_ 19 vaccination can be done in an allergy unit , 29 ( 49.2 % ) participants would vaccinate with the full dose with an observation time of 1 h , 22 ( 37.3 % ) suggested fractionated doses . some colleagues emphasized that all allergy centres that provide covid_ 19 vaccination are able to manage any anaphylactic reaction ; thus , fractionated doses could be avoided . in case of anaphylaxis with ( additional ) extracutaneous involve _ ment ( grade_ii or iii ) induced by a drug taken orally ( but not a laxative or a bowel preparation ) , containing peg or ps as excipients in its for _ mulation , without any skin test with excipients , 37/62 participants ( 59.7 % ) recommended performing drug skin tests , 17.7 % directly contraindicate mrna vaccines , while 29 ( 46.8 % ) would vaccinate with the full dose with at least 30 min observation , and 15 ( 24.2 % ) answers recommending vaccinating in an allergy unit . in a patient with a high risk for covid_ 19 infection , who has a history of urticaria or systemic skin reaction after administration of an injectable drug containing peg or ps and who has positive skin tests for peg or ps , the majority of the participants ( 57.6 % ) would not vaccinate the patient . among 59 centres , 42.4 % of the partici__ pants would vaccinate with fractionated doses . in a patient with systemic mastocytosis and no history of ana _ phylaxis due to injectable drugs or vaccine , 39.3 % of the 61 par _ ticipants considered that mastocytosis patients with no history of anaphylaxis can have injection in any vaccination centre , 28 ( 45.9 % ) would prefer a vaccination in a hospital vc and in an allergy unit in 21.3 % of the answers . in a patient with an uncontrolled asthma and no history of ana _ phylaxis due to injectable drugs or vaccine , 38.7 % of the participants would vaccinate in a vc as for non_ asthmatic patients , 28/62 ( 45.1 % ) preferred to vaccinate in a hospital vc and 18 ( 16.1 % ) in an allergy department . among 64 participants , 62.5 % would consider vaccination in fractionated doses , but twenty_ two participants contraindicated a fractionated vaccination , with the following reasons : fractionation reduced volume of the vaccine solution ( dead vol _ ume in the needle ) ( 4/18.2 % ) ; concerned about the efficacy of the vaccine while waiting after thawing it up ( 5/22.7 % ) ; strictly adhere to vaccination protocol , an allergy team knows how to manage an anaphylactic reaction , ( 11/50 % ) . the other answers all detailed in the online deposit took into account an improper use of vaccine ; its loss of efficacy , the absence of official recommendation or too little data for doing fractionated injection or the small volume of available vaccine solution to fractionate it . among 44 participants who considered fractionated vaccination , different fractionated dose protocols were proposed . the results are reported in table 2 . most of the participants ( 26 , 59 % ) proposed 1/10 then 9/10 of the vaccine dose ( usual full volume for pfizer vaccine being 0.3 ml and for moderna 0.5 ml ) . in case of graded injection , only 5 ( 11.4 % ) injected the 2 doses in the same arm . seven ( 16 % ) participants also proposed a desensitization protocol ; details are also given in table 2 . two participants emphasized that 0.3 ml is so small , that it is too inexact to use 1/10 ( 0.03 ml ) . hence , they recommended not to inject less than 1/3 of the usual volume ; thus , 0.1ml ( 1/3 ) should be the first fraction for pfizer vaccine . considering fractionated doses in specific patients who are skin test positive , 24/28 ( 85.7 % ) participants would inject 1/10 of the volume then 9/10 ( with a 30 min interval for 50 % of the participants ) and 4 ( 14.2 % ) would inject 1/3 of the volume then 2/3 . the propos _ als are summarized in table 2 . skin tests to ascertain whether vaccination is possible from 64 returns showed that in 51.6 % of the centres , 38 ( 59 % ) would test with the vaccine and 81.6 % perform prick to prick with the residua in the vaccine vial . 65.2 % 30 of the 46 returns did not perform idt using the same vial of vaccine . considering the availability of peg or ps for skin tests in their centres , 62.5 % of the 64 participants were able to tests with the pure excipients of the vaccines . the list and percentage of the ex _ cipients tested by 42 participants are summarized in figure 1 . the main excipients tested were peg 4000 ( 42.9 % ) , peg 2000 ( 38.1 % ) and ps 80 ( 66.7 % ) . concerning the possibility for testing excipients of covid_ 19 vaccines , among 64 answers , 51.6 % of the participants tested with drugs containing the same excipients as the vaccines , but among 48 responders , 54.2 % did not test with long_ acting corticosteroids and 74.5 % of 51 did not use other vaccines containing excipients of inter _ est for idt . in the case of delayed urticaria occurring more than 4 h after in _ jection , among the 60 answers there were various approaches . in 32 centres , no skin tests were done but they vaccinate in a hospital cen _ tre ( in allergy unit or another department ) was proposed in 21/32 cases ( 65.6 % ) . tests were done in 25 centres , recommending in case of negative results to inject the following dose under antihistamine treatment in 9/25 cases ( 36 % ) , with an hospital observation in 14/25 cases ( 56 % ) and 3_ h duration in 12 cases . in some centres , it was possible to perform skin tests , if negative , to inject on same day the full vaccine dose with a 30 min hospital observation . among 43 answers , in case of negative skin tests with vaccine and excipients , 30 centres ( 70 % ) proposed to inject the vac _ cine 30 or 60 min after the reading of the skin tests . in case of delayed exanthema , 44 of the 64 participants ( 68.8 % ) would not do patch tests with the vaccine , 48/64 ( 75 % ) would inject the full dose , after prescribing topical corticosteroids for 39 of them ( 60.9 % ) , but 13 ( 20.3 % ) preferred to switch to another vaccine of a different vaccine platform . considering in vitro tests , only 37.5 % of the 64 participants are able to perform in vitro tests , mainly bat in 37 centres . among 48 answers , 37 participants considered bat ( 77.1 % ) , 15 ( 31.3 % ) specific ige against peg and 11 ( 22.9 % ) specific ige against ps 80 or ps20 . only 5 ( 10.4 % ) considered basophil histamine release test , but 6 centres ( 12.5 % ) answered that in vitro tests were not relevant . 13989995 , 2022 , 8 , downloaded from https : //onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/all.15241 by

vaccines in patients with history of allergy . also , there is no global consensus on the optimal allergological investigation and management of patients with prior reactions to covid_ 19 vaccines . in the present survey , the main area of disagreement is on whether doses should be fractionated when vaccinating patients with a perceived increased risk of reactions to the vaccines . however , we consider that consensus can be reached and recommendations developed . concerning the delay of occurrence of anaphylaxis , we have followed the eaaci anaphylaxis guidelines,60 emphasizing that severe anaphylaxis occurs within the 2 h after exposure to the allergen.according to the international consensus on allergic_reactions to vaccines,61 immediate allergic_reactions will be those occurring less than 4 h post_ vaccination and delayed reactions those appear _ ing more than 4 h after administration of the vaccine . with the covid_ 19 vaccines , we consider that immediate reactions occur within the 2 h following the injection . 4.1 | how to vaccinate allergic patients with covid_ 19 mrna vaccines ? concerning mrna vaccines , according to the cdc recommenda _ tion,15 banerjee et al,28 eaaci

proposed by participants for fractionated ( graded ) vaccine doses , kelso et al.13 recommend for any vaccine solution to inject graded doses as follows . if the full vaccine dose is normally a volume of 0.5 ml , the patient is first given 0.05 ml of a 1:10 dilution and then given full_ strength vaccine ( at 15_ min intervals ) at doses of 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.15 and finally 0.2 ml , for a cumulative

creative_commons license 2302 | barbaud et al . the recommendations , which are summarized in table 3 . there are no recommended restrictions on first vaccination of allergic pa _ tients with non_ mrna vaccines . however , the recommendation for what to do in patients who had having previously reacted to ps 80 contained in many non_ mrna vaccines remains debatable . in such cases , on the same principle that applies to other vaccines contain _ ing ps 80 , mrna covid_ 19 vaccines are contraindicated . we consider that the risk needs to be centred in identifying or ruling out an undiagnosed allergy to peg or ps . an allergy work_ up is recomme nded in case of ( 1 ) history of an immediate ( < 2 h ) or severe al _ lergic reaction ( anaphylaxis ) to injectable drugs ( e.g . depot_ steroids ) or vaccines containing peg , ps 80 or 20 , polyoxyl 35 castor_oil ( e.g . paclitaxel ) , ( 2 ) history of immediate or severe allergic_reactions due to peg or ps especially if due to several different drugs , mainly drugs with peg as active_ingredient ( laxatives , colic preparation ) , ( 3 ) his _ tory of prior severe allergic_reaction ( anaphylaxis ) to the vaccine in question , or to another covid_ 19 vaccine with the same platform , ( 4 ) history of anaphylaxis of unknown cause , after an extensive al _ lergy work_ up , which might be caused by peg , ps or polyoxyl . if a patient takes daily medications containing peg , allergy to peg is quite unlikely . also , patients may have a distant history of an allergic_reaction to a vaccine , but if they have since tolerated inject _ able drugs such as biologicals or even the same or other vaccines containing ps 80 a significant allergy to ps is less likely . in 131 patients with a history of severe allergies , wider contra _ indications to a vaccination than usual were evaluated by question _ naire followed by prick_tests to vaccines and excipients ( peg 3350 and trometamol ) .62 spts with the mrna vaccine and trometamol were negative in all cases . two patients had positive peg 3350 prick_tests and were not vaccinated,24/25 and 104/104 were , re _ spectively , vaccinated with pfizer vaccine or moderna with a good tolerance . the more stringent selection proposed herein should be assessed in the same way . the management of patients according to the results of allergy work_ up is reported in figure 2 . 4.2 | how to test patients who had developed reaction after injection of a covid_ 19 vaccine ? the first step of evaluation is a detailed clinical history including al _ lergy history , any previous allergic_reactions to drugs and detailed description of the reaction to the covid_ 19 vaccine . in case of a local reaction to covid_ 19 vaccine , the recommen _ dation is to administer the full dose as a normal vaccination with 15 min observation . a topical corticosteroid could be prescribed , and the patient should be told to present to an outpatient clinic in case of renewed symptoms . in case of a generalized immediate reactions ( < 2h ) , skin testing is the most important method for diagnosis , although sensitivity and specificity remain undetermined . skin prick_tests and idt are carried out according to enda guidelines.63we recommend a prick_ to_ prick test with the suspected vaccine and prick_tests with a range of excipients ( see table 4 ) . there is no latex in the vaccine vial , but if latex material has been used during the injection , prick test with latex material or specific ige to latex may be considered . if chlorhexidine or other disinfectant was ap _ plied at the injection_site , a prick test and if possible , idt and/or specific ige to chlorhexidine may be considered.64 if the left_ over vaccine in used vials is accessible , a prick test can be performed with the vaccine solution ( recommended by 81 % of the participants ) . as there is a global shortage of vaccine , we do not recommend using a new vaccine vial to perform idt . a case for performing idt , starting with very low concentrations , is in the case of positive prick_tests to peg and ps 80 but negative prick_ to_ prick to mrna vaccines . idt with mrna vaccine have been observed to induce unspecific delayed reactions in patients and controls ( mihaela zidarn personal communication ) . immediate reading could be specific . it has been re _ ported that idt with the pure pfizer vaccine solution were negative on immediate reading in 53/54 controls ( 96 % ) .65 the solution was obtained after extracting 5 doses from the pfizer vaccine vial , the injected volume was not specified . we emphasize that the updated recommendations for this vaccine are to use special syringes capable of extracting 7 doses per vial and not 5 doses . it will not be possible to perform idt with the residua in the vial . as 62.5 % of the 64 participants of the survey were able to test with the pure excipients of the covid_ 19 vaccine , we recommend prick_tests with the excipients in pure form ( question 22 ) . as the excipients in pure form are not in sterile form , they can not be used for idt . we have no recommendation for their use for patch tests in delayed reactions ( question 30 ) . some have published the results of idt with ps 80,43 but , as ps 80 in pure form is not sterile and available for human use , we do not recommend idt done with pure excipients . in 37.5 % of the centres , pure excipients were not available ( question 22 ) , and in some countries , skin tests are allowed only with commercialized drugs ; thus , an alternative method can be proposed in using injectable drug containing the excipients of interest.21 even if many participants do not agree ( question 25 ) , injectable drugs , corticosteroids ( methylprednisolone acetate containing peg 3350 , triamcinolone acetonide containing ps80 ) or single_ use sterile eye_drops containing polysorbate 80 may be used for spt and idt,28 but 74.5 % of the participants do not rec _ ommend performing idt with vaccines containing ps ( question 26 ) . in literature , there is only one case with a positive idt done with edta diluted at 0.3 mg/ml.56 trometamol can be tested in using injectable drugs contain _ ing it such as radiocontrast media . in one case of sensitization to gadolinium_ based contrast agents , idt with trometamol at 1:1000 was positive ( 10 negative controls with idt at 1:10 ) , but unfortu _ nately , the trometamol initial concentration was not given.66 according to limited data on the specificity of these tests , some recommendations can be given . they are summarized in table 4 . as far as possible , we recommend testing pure excipients by prick_tests . as peg are in powder or crystalized form , they have to be diluted after being heated in a water bath.67 13989995 ,

assessment of allergy risk related to covid_ 19 vaccination are exceptional at least in germany and denmark ( knut brockow , lene heise garvey personal communication ) . cross_ reactivity between peg and ps 20 is poorly elucidated . among 15 peg allergy patients in one centre in denmark , 7 have been tested with ps 20 and all tested negative . in these cases , sanofi vaccine might be an option . the clinical relevance of cross_ sensitization with ps 80 is uncertain . the astrazeneca vaccine con _ tains very low amount of ps 80 but requires two doses . the johnson and johnson vaccine has a slightly higher amount of ps 80 , but is a single_ dose vaccine ( lene heise garvey , personal communication ) . coronavac ( sinovac ) does not contain peg or ps but it is not avail _ able in most of the european countries.10 4.4 | limitations of management due to the specific characteristic of covid_ 19 vaccines as there is a huge shortage of vaccine doses all over the world , ethi _ cally , it is not possible to propose to use a vaccine for an allergologi _ cal work_ up or fractionated re_ administration . therefore , for drug skin tests , it is only possible to suggest to perform prick_ to_ prick with the vaccine solution and not idt . as used for food allergy , you dip the lancet in the vaccine solution then immediately prick the skin . obviously , hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients is a formal contraindication for drug administration ( according to summary of product characteristics ) , but some advo _ cate that fractionated doses could be given after risk_ benefit assess _ ment and obtaining the informed_consent of the patient . a third of participants would not fractionate vaccine to immunize . the method to inject fractioned doses is debatable . 62.5 % of the 62 participants disapproved to consider fractioned doses with covid_ 19 vaccines . with non_ covid_ 19 vaccines , kelso et al.13 have recommended to inject graded doses with a 5 step_ protocol . if the full vaccine dose is normally a volume of 0.5 ml , the patient is first given 0.05 ml of a 1:10 dilution and then given full_ strength vaccine ( at 15_ min intervals ) at doses of 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.15 and finally 0.2 ml , for a cumulative dose of 0.5 ml . when reconstituted for use , the mrna biontech_ pfizer has a 0.3 ml volume and the moderna 0.5 ml . therefore , with a unique dose , it will be necessary to prepare 0.03 ml of the solution diluted at 1:10 , then with the usual concen _ tration to inject every 15 min 0.03 ml , 0.06 ml , 0.09 ml and then 0.12 ml . technically , in using only one dose of 0.3 ml , this seems impossible to do . some participants have emphasized that 0.3 ml is so small , that it is too inexact to use 1:10 ( 0.03 ml ) . hence , they rec _ ommend not to inject less than 1/3 of the usual volume , thus , 0.1 ml ( 1/3 ) should be the first fraction for the pfizer biontech vaccine ; and the fractioned doses for mrna vaccines could be 1/3 then 2/3 . these vaccines have to be injected with specific long needles ; this leads a significant dead volume in the needle . thus , if there are many successive injections in changing the needle , the final volume administered can be lower than recommended . recently , 1 ml syringes with a peculiar plunger have been recommended for drug spt idt patch_test name of the tested

| barbaud et al . covid_ 19 vaccines in order to reduce the dead volume . thus , these syringes should be used for fractioned doses . to date , we do not know that in enabling injection of whether it is possible to transfer the vaccine dose into a sterile vial or in another syringe , if pumping successive doses does not run the risk of dam _ aging the lipid nanoparticles , reducing the vaccine load and possibly modifying its immunogenicity . the risk of destroying the nanoparticles by further diluting the solution to reach the 1:10 concentration is unknown . it should be remembered that the nanoparticles are fragile and that the first dilution must be done without shaking the vial but by gently in _ verting it 10 times in a row . as we lack information on the stability of the vaccine in a fractionated solution , we can not recommend it . in case of necessity to switch from a mrna vaccine to a vaccine manufactured on a different platform ( e.g . adenovirus vector astra zeneca ) , the 2nd injection has to be done , 4 to 6 weeks after the 1st injection . 4.5 | mastocytosis according to recent recommendations,72 there is no evidence for a generally increased risk for vaccination in adults with mastocytosis . in patients without a history of previous anaphylaxis or anaphylaxis to a well_ defined trigger ( e.g . hymenoptera venom ) , substances not containing peg , there is a low risk and routine vaccination in outpa _ tient setting with a prolonged supervision for 30 min after vaccina _ tion can be done . the same applies for patients with prior anaphylaxis without known triggers ( idiopathic anaphylaxis ) , but not to peg and in those with previous non_ anaphylactic reactions ( e.g . local redness , fever , generalized malaise ) to other vaccines , in whom routine vac _ cination with 30– 60 min supervision can be done and premedication with a sedating or non_ sedating h1 antihistamine should be consid _ ered . for mastocytosis , patients at high risk of anaphylaxis to the first dose of covid_ 19 vaccine are those with known or suspected allergy to peg or ps 80/20 , patients with previous anaphylaxis to vaccination , unstable patients with mastocytosis and severe uncon _ trolled mcas symptoms . these patients require allergy evaluation to decide whether vaccination can be attempted at all , avoiding vac _ cines and ingredients ( e.g . peg ) with positive skin tests , in a hospi _ tal setting with resuscitation capabilities , emergency awareness . all adult mastocytosis patients should carry their unexpired adrenaline auto_ injectors with them also to the vaccination site . 4.6 | is there any place for in vitro tests in diagnosis ? after a thorough history , the determination of basal tryptase is nec _ essary . if elevated , a kit mutation analysis in peripheral blood or bone marrow should be done to exclude mastocytosis . according to the history , specific ige against latex , chlorhexidine , ethylene oxide , α _ gal or gelatine could be tested.2 some participants in the survey think that in vitro tests are not relevant . participants in the survey who have the opportunities to perform in vitro tests recommend bat over specific ige against peg or ps . according to german recommendations , as ige antibodies against peg 2000 ( or igm antibodies ) , which are thought to play a role in triggering complement_ mediated hypersensitivity reactions to peg , are currently not available , a bat can be considered , but no certified and validated test systems are currently available.2 calogiuri et al.48 emphasized that bat has to be performed with the original peg_ formulation inducing the adverse_reaction . since february 2021 , peg 2000 used in mrna vaccines has been com _ mercialized , thus is available for in vitro tests . from literature , there are six cases of positive bat with peg in patients with drug_ induced anaphylaxis due to peg who also had positive prick_tests with the same peg.30,73,74 one patient with positive prick test to peg 3350 and a second one with positive idt to pfizer vaccine had positive bat with pegylated liposomal particles . bat were negative with peg with molecular weights from 200 to 6000 mw.75 from a limited number of patients sensitized to the covid_ 19 vaccines , bat has table 5 skin tests for a minimal common protocol . in bold letters the

be helpful to determine an allergy to the vaccine , as a positive result in bat probably indicates a past sars_ cov_ 2 infection rather than vaccine sensitization . bat could be useful for detecting a sensitization to the excipients.76 elisa for peg has not been standardized.48 histamine release tests with peg give disappointing results , because they may be positive shortly after diagnosis , but become negative over time.77 in 10 cases with positive prick_tests to peg or peg derivatives , only 2 patients had positive histamine release tests.67 5 | limitations of this study as the

allergy or after allergy to a covid_ 19 vaccine , the use_ fulness of the recommended skin tests , mainly prick_tests , will remain to be evaluated in prospective studies . prick_tests with any drugs have a lower sensitivity than idt , but at the moment , as vaccines are in short supply , we can not recommend using covid_ 19 vaccine for doing idt . 6 | conclusion this questionnaire , the analysis of the literature and experiences after a few months of vaccination practice in europe make it pos _ sible to refine the recommendations for vaccinating allergic patients . vaccination is the best way to control the pandemic . allergists , in harmonizing their practices , will limit contraindications to vaccina _ tion and help to vaccinate people supposed to be at risk of allergic_reactions . these recommendations will help , through in vivo and in vitro tests , to better understand the mechanisms of anaphylactic re _ actions to these vaccines , which fortunately remain very rare . the algorithm to vaccinate patients after a previous anaphylaxis due to a covid_ 19 vaccine will need to be evaluated . author contribution statement ba , glh , aa , bk , mf , mc , bp , a_ mm , ml and tmj involved

storage stages , including safety concerns due to human exposure to large amounts of co 2 from dry_ice sublimation , issues due to the pressure increase caused by dry_ice sublimation , and the potential issue caused by non_uniform cryogenic temperatures . as such , there is a need for test dataset to assist the development of a quick , effective , secure , and safe solution to mitigate the challenges faced by vaccine distribution logistics . background & summary along with development and manufacturing , vaccine distribution also presents great challenges for supply_chain since most covid_19 vaccines require ambient temperature control for transportation and storage . two types of vaccine have been developed by manufacturers ( pfizer and moderna ) . both vaccines are based on mrna and lipid nanoparticles requiring low temperature storage . the pfizer vaccine requires ultra_low temperature storage ( −80 °c to −60 °c ) , while the moderna vaccine requires − 30 °c storage 1 . pfizer has designed a reusable package for transportation and storage that can keep the vaccine at the target temperature for 10 days and can accom _ modate between 1,000 and 5,000 doses2 . however , the last stage of distribution is quite challenging3 , especially for rural or suburban areas , where local towns , pharmacy chains and hospitals may not have the infrastructure required to store the vaccine at the required temperature 4 . also , the need for a large amount of ultralow temper _ ature refrigeration equipment in a short time period creates tremendous pressure on equipment suppliers5 . in addition , there is limited data available to address ancillary challenges of the distribution framework for both transportation and storage stages , including safety concerns due to human exposure to large amounts of co 2 from dry_ice sublimation , issues due to the pressure increase caused by dry_ice sublimation , and the potential damage caused by cryogenic temperatures . as such , there is a need for a quick , effective , secure and safe prod _ uct/solution to mitigate the challenges faced vaccine distribution logistics . to address this gap , this study is to evaluate a local vaccine storage solution which uses refrigerated con _ tainer technology to ensure a significant increase in vaccine viable time with reliable temperature control . experimental data have been obtained to assess the technical merits of utilizing container refrigeration units with the ability to control temperature at −30 °c as part of the last mile supply_chain for vaccine candidates , specifically , • investigate the temperature distribution of refrigeration storage container to assist thermal design optimiza_ tion of cargo layout for the vaccine cartons for maintaining vaccine temperature within its required temper _ ature tolerances . 1oak ridge national laboratory , one bethel valley road , oak ridge , tn , 37830 , usa . 2carrier global corporation , 6304 carrier pkwy ,

acceptable co2 concentrations inside the refrigeration storage container . methods the dataset was collected from two laboratory test platforms . a detailed description of test hardware and test platforms are given in the following sections . refrigeration unit . the test unit is a refrigeration container unit of lightweight aluminum frame construc_ tion , designed to be bolted on to the front of a container and serve as the container ’ s front wall . the unit is self_contained and all electric unit , which includes cooling and heating systems to provide precise temperature control from − 35 °c to 30 °c . the unit is supplied with a complete charge of refrigerant and compressor lubri_ cating oil and is ready for operation upon installation . the base unit operates on nominal 380/460 volt , 3_phase , 50/60 hertz ( hz ) power . an optional autotransformer may be fitted to allow operation on nominal 190/230 volt , 3_phase , 50/60 hz power . control system power is provided by a transformer which steps the supply power down to 12 and 24 volts , single phase . the unit uses a microprocessor controller which operates automatically to select cooling , holding or heating as required to maintain the desired set point temperature within very close limits . the controller has a keypad and display for viewing or changing operating parameters , such as various modes of operation . vaccine packages . two types of packages are used in this test : generic insulated box and pharmaceutical box . the specifications of these two packages are listed in table 1 , test instruments . the test units have been fully instrumented for monitoring the performance of proposed ultralow temperature refrigeration for coivd 19 vaccine distribution solution , including temperatures , pressure difference , co 2/o2 concentrations . specifically , type_t thermocouples are used to monitor the temperature pro_ files of refrigeration container , temperature of packages , supply and return air_temperature of refrigeration sys_tem . co 2 and o2 concentration levels inside of refrigeration container unit are measured through non_dispersive infrared co2 sensor and figaro o2 sensor , both are pass through types . omega differential pressure transmitter measures the pressure difference between inside and outside of refrigeration container unit . considering the low temperature working environment , mechanical scales are selected to weight dry_ice during sublimation . more details of these instruments are given in technical validation section . test platforms . two test platforms have been established for this study . as shown in fig . 1 , the test plat_ form a is set up at indoor lab space . a container refrigeration unit was used with attaching to a 40′ × 8′ × 8.6′ ( 12.2 m × 2.44 m × 2.62 m ) / l × w × h refrigerated container . the refrigeration storage container unit with attached container is fully instrumented with , • thermocouples , locations of thermocouples depend on different tests • co2 sensor and o2 sensor to track the changes of co2 and o2 concentration levels inside refrigeration con_ tainer unit along with dry_ice sublimation process . • pressure transducer to monitor the pressure differential from inside and outside the refrigeration container • mechanical scales to measure dry_ice weight changes during sublimation to monitoring the dry_ice sublima_tion process • third party real_time temperature monitors • third party temp monitoring system ( aws ) for test platform b , the refrigeration storage container unit with attaching to a 40′ × 8′ × 8.6′ ( 12.2 m × 2.44 m × 2.62 m ) / l × w × h refrigerated container is placed outside of building , as shown in fig . 2 . the refrigeration storage container unit with attached

www.nature.com/scientificdata/test 1 . the first test was conducted in test platform a ( fig . 1 ) . the thermocouples have been installed inside of the refrigeration container unit to monitor the temperature distribution . the locations of these thermocouples are shown in the fig . 3 . 20 styrofoam boxes ( b1 to b20 ) were placed inside of the refrigeration container unit in two rows along both side walls while one more box ( b0 ) was placed outside in the ambient for comparison purposes . the placement of the boxes can be seen in fig . 4 . the dry_ice is delivered and filled in these 21 boxes ( b0 to b20 ) with approximate 50 lbs dry_ice going into each of them . a thermocouple is installed inside each of these 21 boxes ( fig . 5 ) , however the locations of thermocouples inside these boxes are not same for all boxes , which will lead the different characteristics of boxes temperature profiles in test 1 . to evaluate the dry_ice sublimation , one of the boxes ( b11 in the fig . 4 ) on the inside of the container was placed on a mechanical scale with a closed caption television camera pointed at the scale . this was also repeated on the outside with the box b0 that was in the ambient for comparison purposes . a set of o2 and co2 sensors was utilized by using a diaphragm pump located at the rear of the unit . it was hooked up using plastic tubing to pump the air from the inside of the refrigeration container to the sensor through a hole going through the drain holes of the refrigeration container . to monitor the pressure differential from inside and outside the refrigeration container , an omega 5 v differ _ ential pressure monitor was installed at the rear of the unit with tube going through the refrigeration units frame and stretching to the pressure monitor . test starts with unit reach the setpoint temperature − 34.5 °c and 100 % open fresh_air vent ( fav ) , and all temperatures are recorded with 10 seconds of sample time . although co2 was kept low concentration level , but it is unable to maintain the setpoint . fav was closed after approximating 24 hours . approximate 100 hours after the test staring , fav was opened for dissipation of co 2 while still trying to maintain setpoint inside the refriger _ ation container . fav was left open for remainder of test . the mechanical scale reading of boxes ( b11 and b0 ) are recorded through closed caption television camera at 3_hour intervals . test 2 . the second test was conducted in test platform b ( fig . 2 ) . thermocouples have been installed inside of refrigeration container unit to monitor the temperature distribution , as shown in fig . 6 . 20 styrofoam boxes ( b1 to b20 ) were placed inside of refrigeration container unit in two rows and two layers along both side walls while two boxes were placed inside of laboratory for comparison purposes . the placement of the boxes can be seen in fig . 7 . an empty small payload box was set inside of each package with

during door_open period . the door was closed after the co2/o2 concentration levels reaching safe values . according to the test data , the temperatures of each payload box follow similar temperature profiles , a generic temperature profile of a vaccine payload box can be defined as shown in fig . 9 . the temperature profile can be divided into two regions : a temperature tolerable zone and a temperature non_tolerable zone . if the amount of dry_ice left in the vaccine package can ’ t maintain the payload box temperature within the required temperature range of between −80 °c and −60 °c , it is in the temperature non_tolerable zone . otherwise , it is in the temper _ ature tolerable zone , which can be further divided into two stages : a stable period and an unstable period . in the stable period , the dry_ice can keep the payload box at the dry_ice boiling_point ( sublimation point ) temperature of −78.5 °c . when the payload box temperature starts to rise but is still within the required temperature range , it is in the unstable period of the temperature_tolerable zone . technical validation the test refrigeration container unit and vaccine packages were fully instrumented to monitor the operational performance . the measurement includes temperature distribution inside refrigeration container unit , temper _ ature inside vaccine packages , supply and return

. beside the measurement , simulation models7 were also used to present the technical quality of the data set . a computational fluid dynamic ( cfd ) simulation model has been created using a commer _ cial software , ansys/fluent ( version 17.2 ) 8 , to replicate the experiments setup , including the size of the con_ tainer and the size of the box , the distribution of the boxes . the sizes of the container and package ( l × w × h ) are 12.2 m × 2.4 m × 2.6 m and 0.53 m × 0.53 m × 0.48 m , respectively . a mesh of 1.7 million cells was generated for the simulation . since the supply air is colder , the air inlets ( supply air ) locate at the floor of the container , where a series of t_shaped bars are used as diffuser to disperse the air flow . the return air locates at the top of the ac unite as the outlet of the flow loop of the container . the boundary conditions of the cfd model , including temperatures of the container walls , temperatures of the t_shaped bars , temperature of the supply air , and flow rate of the supply air are from the experiments . in this model , the adiabatic boundary conditions were applied to the boxes assuming that boxes are perfectly insulated . equations of fluid flow and heat transfer are solved in the model . the buoyancy force effect is considered in the model by employing boussinesq approximation due to the density change of air with various temperature . a standard k_ε model is used to describe the turbulence flow . to validate the model , the experimental data are used to compared with steady_state simulation results gen _ erated by developed cfd model under the same conditions as the experiment . temperatures were compared from six data points in the container ( as shown in fig . 10 ) , as well as at the return air grille . table 4 shows the comparison results . the temperatures from the cfd model were slightly lower than the experimental data , which may be due to the uncertainty in the testing . nevertheless , the results show a reasonable agreement between experimental data and simulation results . code availability no specific code was generated for analysis of these data . received : 26 august 2021 ;

on the use of the pﬁzer and the moderna covid_19 mrna vaccines in children and adolescents michael palmer , md sucharit bhakdi , md , and wolfgang wodarg , md april 29 , 2022 doctors4covidethics.org abstract this document provides a comprehensive risk_beneﬁt analysis of the use of the pﬁzer and moderna covid_19 vaccines in children and adolescents , and it makes the case that the vaccines are neither needed nor safe and have not been proven to be eﬃcacious , partic_ ularly when considering the omicron variant of sars_cov_2 , which currently dominates worldwide . in addition to the evidence of manifest harm from the us and eu adverse_event reporting systems , it also addresses the risk of genotoxicity of the mrna vaccines , which due to recent experimental evidence of their integration into host_cell genomes must be considered urgent . contents summary 3 1 vaccination of children adolescents against covid_19 is unnecessary 4 1.1 what does the available evidence show ?

2 . are the pﬁzer and moderna covid_19 vaccines eﬀective ? 3 . are these vaccines safe ? the arguments presented in section 1 pertain to all covid_19 vaccines , whereas those in sec_ tions 2 and 3 apply speciﬁcally to the pﬁzer and moderna covid_19 vaccines . section 1 will show that vaccination of adolescents covid_19 is unnecessary , because in this age_group the disease is almost always mild and benign ; for the rare clinical cases that require it , treatment is readily available ; immunity to the disease is widespread , due to prior infection with the virus ( sars_cov_2 ) or with other coronavirus strains ; and asymptomatic adolescents are very unlikely to transmit the disease to other individuals who might be at greater risk of infection . section 2 will demonstrate that the claims of eﬃcacy the manufacturers ( pﬁzer and moderna ) attach to their vaccines—namely , 95 % eﬃcacy in adults , and 100 % in adolescents—are 3 misleading , because these numbers pertain to relative , not absolute eﬃcacy , the latter being less than 1 % ; specious , because they refer to an arbitrarily deﬁned , clinically meaningless evaluation end_ point , whereas no eﬃcacy at all has been demonstrated against mortality ; outdated , because the original strain of the sars_cov_2 virus , against which they were de_ veloped , has since been superseded by a succession of ever more highly mutated variants ; and apparently altogether fraudulent . section 3 will show that the safety proﬁles of the pﬁzer and moderna covid_19 vaccines are catastrophically bad . it will be discussed that pﬁzer , moderna and the ema have systematically neglected evidence from preclinical animal trials that clearly pointed to grave dangers of adverse_events ; the pﬁzer and moderna covid_19 vaccines have caused thousands of deaths since their introduction ; the agencies that granted emergency_use_authorization for these vaccines committed grave errors and omissions in their assessments of known and possible health risks ; recent evidence shows that the mrna of the pﬁzer covid_19 vaccine ( and presumably of the moderna vaccine , too ) can be copied into dna within human host_cells and then integrate into the cellular dna . this implies grave risks not only for the vaccinees themselves , such as cancer and autoimmune disease , but also for their oﬀspring . the only possible conclusion from this analysis is that the use of these vaccines in children and adolescents can not be permitted , and that their ongoing use in any and all age_groups ought to be stopped immediately . 1 vaccination of children adolescents against covid_19 is unnecessary 1.1 what does the available evidence show ? there are several lines of evidence that show vaccination of children and adolescents against covid_19 to be unneeded . 1.1.1 the case_fatality_rate of covid_19 in the general population is low . the vast major_ ity of all persons infected with covid_19 recovers after minor , often uncharacteristic illness . according to world_leading epidemiologist john ioannidis [ 1 , 2 ] , the infection fatality rate of covid_19 is on the order of 0.15 % to 0.2 % across all age_groups , with a very strong bias to_ wards old people with co_morbidities . this rate does not exceed the range commonly observed with inﬂuenza , against which a vaccination of children and adolescents is not considered urgent or necessary . 1.1.2 covid_19 has a particularly low prevalence and severity in children and adolescents . in the u.s. and as of april 2020 , those younger than 18 years accounted for just 1.7 % of all covid_19 cases [ 3 , 4 ] . within this age_group , the most severe cases were observed among very young infants [ 4 ] . this is consistent with the lack in infants of cross_immunity to covid_ 19 , which in other age_groups is conferred by preceding exposure to regular respiratory hu_ man coronaviruses . among slightly older children , a peculiar multisystem inﬂammatory syn_ drome was observed in early 2020 [ 5 ] ; conceivably , these patients , too , were still lacking cross_ 4 immunity . note , however , that some authors consider a post_infectious hypersensitivity mech_ anism more likely [ 6 ] ; this would suggest a signiﬁcant risk of adverse_reactions because of hypersensitivity to vaccination in such children also . similarly low infection rates among the very young were reported from china , with less than 1 % of cases occurring in children younger than 10 years and another 1 % in those 10 to 19 years_of_age [ 7 ] . moreover , in this age_group , disease tends to be very mild [ 4 ] . thus , children and adolescents are at particularly low risk of harm from covid_19 infection . vaccination of of children and adolescents to protect them from the disease is therefore unnecessary . 1.1.3 covid_19 can be treated . numerous experienced physicians have collaborated on estab_ lishing eﬀective treatment guidelines for clinically manifest covid_19 [ 8 ] . treatment options are available both for the early stage of the disease , at which emphasis is placed on inhibiting viral replication , and for the later stage , at which anti_inﬂammatory therapy is paramount [ 9 ] . two drugs that have been used successfully at the early stage are hydroxychloroquine and iver_ mectin . both drugs have been , and continue to be , in use against a variety of other diseases . ivermectin , for example , is considered safe enough to be used not only for treating manifest scabies—a parasite infection of the skin that is unpleasant but not severe—but even prophylac_ tically in asymptomatic contacts of scabies_infected persons [ 10 ] . considering that ivermectin reduces sars_cov_2 virus replication in cell culture by a factor of approximately 5000 [ 11 ] , its favourable clinical eﬀects are not at all surprising . ivermectin is also widely used in the treatment of tropical parasitic diseases such as on_ chocerciasis ( river blindness ) , and for this reason it is on the who ’ s list of essential medicines . yet , with covid_19 , the who sees ﬁt to warn against the use of this very same well_known and safe drug outside of clinical_trials [ 12 ] . this policy can not be rationally justiﬁed , and it has quite appropriately been overridden by national or regional health authorities and ignored by individual physicians worldwide . with hydroxychloroquine , too , there is solid evidence of its eﬃcacy against covid_19 from a large_scale clinical study in brazil [ 13 ] . the availability of eﬀective treatment voids the rationale for the emergency use of vaccines on any and all age_groups , including also adolescents . 1.1.4 many people have natural immunity to sars_cov_2 . due to the many inherent ﬂaws and shortcomings of the diagnostic methods in common use [ 14–16 ] , it is impossible to ac_ curately determine the proportions of those who have already been infected with sars_cov_2 and those who have not . however , there are indications that the proportion of those who have natural immunity is high : in a study conducted in early 2021 , approximately 60 % of randomly selected test persons from british columbia had detectable antibodies against multiple sars_cov_2 proteins ( per_ sonal communication by stephen pelech , university of british columbia ) , indicating past infection with the virus—as opposed to vaccination , which would induce antibodies to only one ( the spike ) protein . comparable numbers were more recently reported by alejo et al . [ 17 ] : speciﬁc antibodies to the sars_cov_2 spike_protein were detected in 99 % of those with a conﬁrmed history of covid_19 , in 55 % who believed they had had covid_19 but were never tested , and in 11 % with no suspected history of the clinical disease . 5 protective immunity—possibly due to cross_immunity induced by respiratory coronaviruses other than sars_cov_2—likely exists in many individuals with no antibodies speciﬁc for the sars_cov_2 spike_protein . in this context , we must note that t_lymphocytes ( rather than antibodies ) have a dominant role in immunity to sars_cov_2 [ 18 ] . a recent study from the uk strikingly illuminated the role of “ stealth ” immunity in the ab_ sence of antibodies [ 19 ] . the investigators experimentally inoculated 36 volunteers intranasally with a high dose of sars_cov_2 . even though all of these subjects had been thoroughly pre_ screened for neither having had covid_19 nor having been vaccinated , only 18 subjects of the 36 became infected ( and two more subjects were excluded due to pre_existing antibodies which were detected post_hoc ) . this suggests that , even among those without a history of infection and without speciﬁc antibodies , natural immunity is widespread . past covid_19 infection has been found to protect very reliably from reinfection [ 20 ] , and strong speciﬁc humoral and cellular immunity is detected in almost all recovered individuals , and also in those who remained asymptomatic throughout the infection [ 21 ] . thus , a large proportion of individuals in all age_groups , including adolescents , already have speciﬁc , reliable immunity to covid_19 . most likely , those who do not have such speciﬁc immunity are protected from severe_disease by cross_immunity ; this is consistent with the observation of memory_type immune reactions among those experiencing their ﬁrst infection [ 21–23 ] . this cross_immunity will be particularly eﬀective and protective in healthy children , adolescents , and young adults . individuals with speciﬁc immunity or suﬃcient cross_immunity will not derive any mean_ ingful beneﬁt from undergoing an experimental vaccination [ 24 ] . indiscriminate vaccination regardless of pre_existing natural immunity can not be rationally justiﬁed . no competent physi_ cian would ever recommend a measles vaccine to someone with a history of measles ; and there is absolutely no reason to treat covid_19 diﬀerently . 1.1.5 asymptomatic transmission of covid_19 is not relevant . an oft_cited rationale for vaccinating individuals who are not themselves at risk of severe_disease is the need to induce “ herd_immunity : ” the few who are at high risk should be protected by preventing the spread of the virus in the general population . a subtext of this rationale is the idea of “ asymptomatic spread ” —persons who have been infected but who show no signs of it other than a positive pcr test are assumed to transmit this infection to other susceptible individuals . if we accept the idea that such asymptomatic spread is important , then preventative mass vaccination might indeed appear as the only means of reliable protection of those at risk . it has , however , been unambiguously determined that such asymptomatic transmission is not epidemiologically signiﬁcant . in a large_scale study , which involved almost 10 million chi_ nese residents , no new infections could be traced to persons that had tested positive for sars__cov_2 by pcr , but who did not exhibit any other signs of infection [ 25 ] . this agrees with several studies that compared pcr to virus isolation in cell culture among patients with acute covid_ 19 disease . in all cases , growth of the virus in cell culture ceased as symptoms subsided , or very shortly thereafter , whereas pcr remained positive for weeks or months afterwards [ 26 , 27 ] . it was accordingly proposed to use cell culture rather than pcr to assess infectiousness and to determine the duration of isolation [ 27 ] . even though it is possible in principle for some people to become infected without clinical symptoms [ 19 ] , the above ﬁndings indicate that restricting contact of persons at risk with those 6 who show , or very recently showed , symptoms of acute respiratory_disease would be eﬀective and suﬃcient as a protective measure . indiscriminate mass vaccinations of persons who are not themselves at risk of severe_disease are therefore not required to achieve such protection . 2 the pﬁzer and moderna covid_19 vaccines lack eﬃcacy 2.1 what does the evidence show ? pﬁzer and moderna persistently tout the 95 % eﬃcacy of their vaccines , based on the clinical_trials that formed the basis of the emergency approvals granted by the fda [ 28 , 29 ] and the european union [ 30 , 31 ] . in pﬁzer ’ s [ 32 ] and moderna ’ s [ 33 ] more recent studies on adolescents , the claimed eﬃcacy has been raised to no less than 100 % . however , these claims can not be taken at face value . 2.1.1 absolute vs. relative eﬃcacy . in pﬁzer/biontech ’ s ﬁrst reported clinical_trial , 43,548 participants underwent randomization , of whom 43,448 received injections . the experimen_ tal vaccine ( bnt162b2 ) was administered to 21,720 persons , whereas 21,728 received placebo . across both groups , a total of 170 covid_19 “ cases ” was recorded , of which 162 occurred in the placebo group , whereas 8 were observed in the bnt162b2 group . based on these ﬁgures— 8/1625 % —pﬁzer proceeded to claim 95 % eﬃcacy . clearly , however , this eﬃcacy is only a rel_ ative value—in absolute terms , less than 1 % of the placebo group developed covid_19 , and therefore less than 1 % of the vaccine group was protected from it . the situation is similar with the subsequent , smaller test carried out on 12_15 years old ado_ lescents [ 32 ] . here , the vaccine group comprised 1131 individuals , whereas the placebo group included 1129 persons . in the latter group , 16 individuals were subsequently diagnosed with covid_19 , whereas no such cases occurred in the vaccine group . true to form , pﬁzer/biontech converted this absolute eﬃcacy of 1.4 % to a relative one of 100 % ; only the latter value is high_ lighted in the abstract of the published study . with moderna ’ s vaccine , the picture is essentially the same . in the ﬁrst reported clinical_trial , the experimental vaccine was administered to 14,134 persons , and 14,073 received placebo . across both groups , a total of 95 covid_19 “ cases ” was recorded , of which 90 occurred in the placebo group , whereas 5 cases were observed in the vaccine group . accordingly , moderna presented this as evidence of 94.5 % eﬃcacy . however , less than 0.6 % of the placebo group developed covid_19 , and therefore less than 0.6 % of the vaccine group was protected from it . in their subsequent study on 12_17 years old adolescents [ 33 ] , the vaccine group comprised 2163 individuals , whereas the placebo group included 1073 persons . in the latter group , a grand total of four ( 4 ) individuals were subsequently diagnosed with covid_19 ; none of these cases were severe . no covid_19 cases were detected in the vaccine group . expectedly , moderna presented this absolute eﬃcacy of 0.37 % as a relative one of 100 % . 2.1.2 negative impact of the pﬁzer and moderna covid_19 vaccines on overall morbidity in adolescents . in pﬁzer ’ s cited vaccine study on adolescents , a “ case ” of covid_19 was deter_ mined as follows : the deﬁnition of conﬁrmed covid_19 included the presence of 1 symptom ( i.e. , fever , new or increased cough , new or increased shortness of breath , chills , new or increased muscle pain , new loss of taste or smell , sore_throat , diarrhea , vomiting ) and being sars__cov_2 naat_positive [ = pcr_positive ] during , or within 4 days before or after , the symp_ tomatic period ( either at the central laboratory or at a local testing facility and using an acceptable test ) . 7 thus , a single symptom from a laundry list of non_characteristic symptoms , plus a positive ﬁnding from an unreliable pcr test [ 14–16 ] , was deemed suﬃcient to establish the diagnosis . while the study goes on to list several clinical criteria of severe_disease , it gives no indication that these were actually observed among the test subjects . it can therefore be assumed that very few non_severe , and no clinically severe cases of covid_19 occurred in the entire test population . in stark contrast to these numbers pertaining to the disease from which the vaccination is supposed to protect , side eﬀects from the vaccination were exceedingly common . apart from injection_site pain occurring in a high percentage of the vaccine group ( 79 % to 86 % ) , fatigue ( 60 % to 66 % ) and headache ( 55 % to 65 % ) abounded . severe fatigue and headache were reported by several percent of the test persons . severe headache , in particular , may be associated with underlying thrombotic events ( see section 3.2.3 ) . it is therefore clear that , if we consider both covid_19 and vaccine adverse eﬀects , overall morbidity was far greater in the vaccinated than in the placebo group . much the same observations apply to moderna ’ s study on adolescents [ 33 ] —as already noted , none of four covid_19 cases in the control group were severe , whereas signiﬁcant side eﬀects were even more common than in pﬁzer ’ s study . 2.1.3 unlikely claims and outright contradictions in pﬁzer ’ s evidence on eﬃcacy . we saw above that the reported eﬃcacy of pﬁzer ’ s vaccine is very modest when expressed in absolute terms . even this low eﬃcacy , however , can not be accepted at face value . this is apparent from the assessment reports prepared by the fda [ 28 ] and the ema [ 30 ] . 2.1.3.1 sudden onset of immunity on day 12 after the ﬁrst injection . a key illustration that occurs in both reports compares the cumulative_incidence of covid_19 among the vaccinated and the placebo group . this graph , which is shown as figure 9 in the ema report , is here reproduced in figure 1a . up to day 12 after the ﬁrst injection , the cumulative incidences in the two groups track each other closely . after day 12 , however , only the placebo group continues to accumulate further new cases at a steady pace , whereas the slope of the graph drops to almost zero in the vaccine group . this remarkable observation suggests that immunity sets in very suddenly and uniformly on day 12 exactly among the vaccinated . since the second injection occurred 19 or more days after the ﬁrst one , this would imply that one injection is enough to establish full immunity . this conclusion , however , is not stated , and in fact pﬁzer does not report any data at all on test persons who received one injection only . a sudden onset of full immunity on day 12 after the ﬁrst exposure to the antigen is not at all a biologically plausible outcome . typically , immunity develops more slowly and gradually , and with substantial variation between individuals . such a pattern is in fact reported for this very same vaccine in figure 7 of the ema report , reproduced here as figure 1b . the ﬁgure shows the increase of neutralizing_antibodies to sars_cov_2 as a function of time after the ﬁrst injection of the vaccine . the induction of neutralizing_antibodies is the declared purpose of the pﬁzer vaccine . gen_ erally speaking , antibodies are protein molecules produced by our immune system when it en_ counters antigens —macromolecules that do not occur within our own bodies . these antigens are often part of infectious microbes , including viruses . an antibody binds to a speciﬁc feature on the surface of its antigen ; this feature is called the epitope of the antibody in question . 8 a bfigure 1 reproduction of figure 9 ( a ; cumulative_incidence of covid_19 among vaccinated and placebo groups ) and of figure 7 ( b ; neutralizing_antibody titres on various days after the ﬁrst injection ) from the ema assessment_report [ 30 ] . note the logarithmic yaxis in b . see text for discussion . in the context of virus infections , antibodies can be neutralizing or non_neutralizing . a neutralizing_antibody recognizes an epitope that is essential for the function of the virus , for example because this epitope must make contact to a receptor molecule on the surface of the host_cell which the virus must enter in order to replicate . a non_neutralizing antibody 9 table 1 subjects without evidence of infection in vaccine and placebo groups at various time points in the clinical_trial . data excerpted from table 4 in [ 30 ] . see text for discussion . vaccine placebo no evidence of infection before dose 1 93.1 % 93.0 % no evidence of infection prior to 14 days after dose 2 85.6 % 85.0 % diﬀerence ( = infection between day 0 and day 14 after dose 2 ) 7.5 % 8.0 % simply happens to recognize a surface feature ( epitope ) that plays no essential role in the infectiousness of the virus . considering the foregoing , we should expect that the blood level of neutralizing_antibodies will reﬂect the degree of clinical immunity to the virus . this is , however , not at all what we see in figure 1b . on day 21 after the ﬁrst injection , that is , a full 9 days after the purported sudden onset of full clinical immunity , the amount of neutralizing_antibodies in the blood has barely risen above the background level . the maximal level of neutralizing_antibodies is observed only on day 28 after the ﬁrst injection , at which time most test persons would already have had their second injection . the time course of cellular ( t_cell ) immunity was not reported , but in the absence of proof positive to the opposite it can be assumed to resemble that of the antibody response . it is very diﬃcult to reconcile the two contrasting observations of sudden onset of full clinical immunity on day 12 , but neutralizing_antibodies appearing only weeks later . yet , the reviewers at neither the ema nor the fda appear to have been at all interested in the problem . 2.1.3.2 the pﬁzer documentation contradicts itself on covid_19 incidence after vaccina__tion . table 1 lists the percentages of subjects in the vaccine group and the placebo group who showed no evidence of sars_cov_2_infection on day 0 ( before the ﬁrst_dose ) and on day 14 after the second dose , respectively . from the diﬀerences between the two time points , we can work out that 7.5 % of the subjects in the vaccine group and 8 % in the control group converted from negative to positive—that is , became infected—between the two time points . according to [ 28 ] , the second dose was administered approximately 21 days after the ﬁrst , although all subjects who received it between days 19 and 42 after the ﬁrst injection were included in the evaluation . if we take day 35 after the ﬁrst injection as the approximate time point of the comparison , we see from figure 1a that the cumulative_incidence between day 0 and day 35 is more than twice higher in the placebo group than in the vaccine group ; but from table 1 , we see that it is almost the same . moreover , with both groups the numbers are substantially higher in the table than in the ﬁgure . these two sets of data can not possibly be reconciled ; one must be false . since , as discussed , the sudden onset of immunity implied by figure 1a lacks any biological plausibility , it is most likely that it is this data set which was fabricated . 2.1.3.3 pﬁzer ’ s data imply that the vaccine protects from covid more eﬀectively than does prior infection with the virus . we can also scrutinize pﬁzer ’ s reported data in order to com_ pare the immunity conferred by the vaccine to that induced by prior natural infection with the virus . the relevant data are summarized in table 2 . the reported 8 cases of covid_19 among vaccinated persons who had initially tested negative for the virus amount to an incidence of 10 table 2 incidence of covid_19 among subjects not previously_infected but vaccinated , or previously_infected but not vaccinated . data excerpted from tables 6 and 7 in [ 28 ] . see text for discussion . vaccine placebo total cases incidence ( % ) total cases incidence ( % ) all subjects 19,965 9 20,172 169 initially negative 18,198 8 0.044 18,325 162 previously_infected 1,767 1 1,847 7 0.38 0.044 % . pﬁzer also reports 7 cases among persons who had initially tested positive but were not vaccinated . since this group is considerably smaller , those 7 cases translate into an almost ninefold higher incidence ( 0.38 % ) . it is common knowledge that vaccines will at best approach , but not surpass the immunity conferred by the corresponding natural infection . very robust immunity after prior natural infection with sars_cov_2 has recently been reported [ 20 ] ; in that study , not a single case of covid_19 reinfection was observed among 1359 previously_infected individuals who had remained unvaccinated . robust immunity after infection is also conﬁrmed by comprehensive laboratory investigations [ 21 ] . a very recent study from israel directly compared protection from reinfection by natural immunity and by vaccination , respectively , and found that the former was clearly superior [ 34 ] . we note that israel mostly uses the pﬁzer vaccine . therefore , the above analysis corroborates yet again that the trial results reported by pﬁzer can not be trusted . that neither the fda nor the ema picked up on any of these inconsistencies does not instil conﬁdence in the thoroughness and integrity of their review processes . 2.1.3.4 allegations of irregularities in pﬁzer ’ s clinical_trials by contractors . several individu_ als who had carried out contract work for pﬁzer in the clinical_trials spoke to the british medical journal about irregularities such as poor laboratory management , delayed and intentionally fal_ siﬁed data entry , and altogether missing follow_up examinations on symptomatic patients [ 35 ] . one of them summed it up as follows : “ i don ’ t think it was good clean data . . . it ’ s a crazy mess. ” 2.1.4 unlikely claims and contradictions in moderna ’ s evidence on eﬃcacy . close scrutiny of the ema assessment_report on the moderna covid_19 vaccine [ 31 ] reveals a similar pattern of exaggerations and inconsistencies . 2.1.4.1 contradictory claims about covid_19 incidence in clinical_trials . the text of the ema document maintains that a total of 90 covid_19 “ cases ” occurred in the placebo arm of the study . on the other hand , the study also shows a graph that is said to represent the cumulative_incidence of covid in both the vaccine and the placebo group ( figure 2 ) . at the bottom of this graph , we see the number of individuals at risk of becoming covid “ cases ” at various time points after their assignment to either group ; from table 20 in [ 31 ] , we can infer that this time point coincides with the ﬁrst injection . the number of those at risk decreases with time ; for example , 9,911 persons in the vaccine group , and 9,736 in the placebo group , were followed during the trial for 80 days or more and were therefore at risk of contracting covid on day 80 . we can estimate that this number would have dropped to 9,000 on or about day 82 . therefore , if all 90 covid cases had been diagnosed on day 82 , then the cumulative 11 figure 2 reproduction of figure 18 of the ema assessment_report [ 31 ] ; arrows added by the authors of this document . the ﬁgure is said to show the cumulative_incidence of covid_19 cases among vaccinated and placebo groups in the clinical study on the moderna covid_19 vaccine . see text for discussion . incidence should on this day be 1 % . however , the dashed arrows drawn atop the graph indicate that the depicted value on this day is approximately 1.6 % . cases diagnosed before day 82 would have occurred among a larger number of individuals at risk , which should have lowered the cumulative_incidence calculated on day 82 . furthermore , the curve continues to rise after day 82 , which implies that some of the altogether 90 cases occurred at a later time . this should further reduce the cumulative_incidence determined on day 82 . thus , while the available information does not permit us to quantify the discrepancy exactly , we can say that it is substantial . once more , it is diﬃcult to see how the ema reviewers could have overlooked this rather glaring problem when doing their due diligence . 2.1.4.2 early vs. late onset of immunity . as with pﬁzer , the data presented by moderna sug_ gest that vaccination induced clinical immunity before raising antibody levels . according to figure 2 , new covid cases accumulated at the same pace within the placebo group and the vaccine group until day 12 or 13 . thereafter , they diverge , indicating the onset of immunity in the vaccinated ; and the uniformly low increase with time of the cumulative_incidence among the vaccinated suggests that the maximum extent of immunity was attained within a very short time period . such an early onset of immunity is not expected after the ﬁrst exposure to an antigen ; instead , it is typical of a memory reaction . the occurrence of memory reactions would ﬁt with the many observations of cross_immunity reported in other studies ( see section 1.1.4 above ) . however , moderna ’ s own data indicate that only some , but not all test persons showed a memory response ; on days 15 and 29 after the ﬁrst injection , the titres of neutralizing anti_ bodies remained low overall , and in what appears to be about half of the individuals below the detection limit ( see figure 3a ) . nor can moderna ’ s reported data on t_cell_mediated immunity account for the rapid onset of clinical immunity : figure 4 shows that any activation of t_cells 12 figure 3 neutralizing_antibodies at various time points after vaccination . a : box_plot of pseudovirus neutralization titres ( adapted from figure 7 of [ 31 ] . note that on days 15 and 29 multiple samples remain below the detection limit ; only on day 36 are neutralizing_antibodies detected in all samples . note also multiple negative samples among convalescent individuals . b : geometric means of neutralizing_antibodies . adapted from figure 16 of the ema report . all data pertain to the age_group between 18 and 55 years . is weak and is observed only on day 43 , that is , after the second injection . this applies in par_ ticular to cd8 cells , which are crucial eﬀectors of cellular antiviral immunity . thus , an obvious discrepancy exists between the early onset of the claimed clinical immunity and the delayed responses observed in immunological laboratory studies . had the ema review been conducted carefully , this inconsistency would not simply have been passed over . 2.2 what evidence is lacking to make the case ? we had already noted the specious and contrived character of the endpoint used in pﬁzer ’ s and moderna ’ s clinical_trials—namely , the counting of a covid_19 “ case ” based on nothing more than a positive pcr result , together with one or more items from a list of mostly uncharacteristic clinical symptoms . we must therefore ask if the vaccine provides any beneﬁts that are more substantial than the claimed—but , as discussed above , most likely fabricated—reduction in the count of such trivial “ cases. ” 2.2.1 prevention of severe_disease and mortality . page 48 of the fda report on the pﬁzer covid_19 vaccine [ 28 ] sums up this question as follows : a larger number of individuals at high risk of covid_19 and higher attack rates would be needed to conﬁrm eﬃcacy of the vaccine against mortality . moderna ’ s study on adults reported 30 cases of “ severe_disease ” in the placebo group , and none in the vaccine group . the ema report elaborates on the criteria for severe_disease as follows [ 31 , p. 109 ] : 13 figure 4 t_cell activation by the moderna covid_19 vaccine . cd4 and cd8 cells were isolated at various time points after the ﬁrst injection and stimulated in vitro with peptide pools representing the s1 or the s2 fragments of the spike_protein and stained for expression of ifn_ , il_2 , and tnf . a : activation of cd4 cells . adapted from figure 10 of [ 31 ] . b : activation of cd8 cells . adapted from figures 11 and 12 of the ema report . all data pertain to vaccine doses of 100 µg and the age_group between 18 and 55 years . the majority of the severe cases were adjudicated as such based on spo 2 [ blood oxygen saturation ] below the deﬁning threshold of 93 % for varying duration . whereas reassuring for eﬃcacy across varying disease severity , the cases overall seem mostly mild , which is a limitation of the dataset . the normal range of arterial blood saturation with o 2is 95 to 100 % ; therefore , the use of a cut_oﬀ as high as 93 % to diagnose a “ severe ” case seems questionable . it is noteworthy that only nine of these “ severe ” cases were hospitalized , and only two required admission to the intensive_care_unit ( one of these two patients died ) . thus , the number of truly severe cases possibly prevented by the vaccine is very small at best . the single fatal case does not suﬃce to prove eﬃcacy against death . the ema assessment_report acknowledges that eﬃcacy against severe covid_19 was not conclusively shown [ 31 , p. 110 ] : it is likely that the vaccine also protects against severe covid_19 , though these events were limited in the study and the deﬁnition of severe covid_19 could have been more stringent from a clinical perspective . no fatalities at all occurred in the cited studies on adolescents [ 32 , 33 ] ; and we already noted that these studies do not report any cases of severe_disease either . therefore , particularly in this speciﬁc age_group , neither a meaningful beneﬁt of vaccination nor an emergency are in evidence . we note that the collective ﬁndings not only answer the posed question in the negative , but also dispose of the entire pretext for granting emergency_use_authorization for these experi_ mental vaccines . if in clinical studies that involve some 30,000 or even 40,000 individuals the incidence of severe_disease or death is too small to permit the detection of any clear beneﬁt of the vaccine , then surely no “ emergency ” exists that would justify the very grave risks , and meanwhile manifest harm , associated with the extraordinarily rushed introduction of these and other covid_19 vaccines . 2.2.2 eﬀectiveness for those at high_risk of severe covid_19 . here , the fda report on the pﬁzer covid_19 vaccine has this to say : 14 although the proportion of participants at high risk of severe covid_19 is adequate for the overall evaluation of safety in the available follow_up period , the subset of certain groups such as immunocompromised individuals ( e.g. , those with hiv/aids ) is too small to evaluate eﬃcacy outcomes . the report shirks the question of risk reduction among those with more common predis_ posing conditions , such as for example chronic heart or lung disease . naturally , the clinical studies on adolescents [ 32 , 33 ] are completely barren in this regard . overall , no evidence has been adduced by pﬁzer ’ s and moderna ’ s clinical studies to prove a clinical beneﬁt in those at high risk of severe covid_19 . 2.2.3 eﬀectiveness against long_term eﬀects of covid_19 disease . the fda ’ s verdict on the pﬁzer covid_19 vaccine is as follows : additional evaluations will be needed to assess the eﬀect of the vaccine in preventing long_term eﬀects of covid_19 , including data from clinical_trials and from the vaccine ’ s use post authorization . in other words , the clinical_trials provided no such evidence . the fda [ 29 ] and ema [ 31 ] reports on the moderna vaccine do not address this question speciﬁcally . 2.2.4 reduction of transmission . on this topic , the pﬁzer fda report oﬀers only that . . . additional evaluations including data from clinical_trials and from vaccine use post_au_ thorization will be needed to assess the eﬀect of the vaccine in preventing virus shedding and transmission , in particular in individuals with asymptomatic infection . similarly , the ema assesses the moderna vaccine as follows : it is presently not known if the vaccine protects against asymptomatic infection , or its impact on viral transmission . in plain_language , there is no evidence that transmission is reduced , and in fact the trials were simply not even designed to prove or disprove such an eﬀect . 2.2.5 duration of protection . the fda on the pﬁzer covid_19 vaccine report correctly states ( on page 46 ) that as the interim and ﬁnal analyses have a limited length of follow_up , it is not possible to assess sustained eﬃcacy over a period longer than 2 months . even if we choose to believe that any eﬃcacy at all has been demonstrated pertaining to the two_month study period , such a short duration of protection does not justify the risks associated with vaccination . regarding the moderna covid_19 vaccine , the ema report arrives at the same conclusion [ 31 , p. 110 ] : long_term protection from disease remains unknown for the time being including for subjects of high_risk groups . . . . the duration of protection is not known . the longevity of protection ( if any ) could of course not be ascertained within clinical_trials of such short duration . however , the rapid failure of the vaccine in the real world has since become apparent ( see section 2.3.4 below ) . 15 2.2.6 inadequate eﬀorts to determine the optimal dose . figure 1b shows that the level of neu_ tralizing antibodies by the pﬁzer covid_19 vaccine is virtually the same with vaccine ( mrna ) doses of 20 µg and 30 µg , respectively . this raises the question why the higher dose was em_ ployed throughout—and not only with adults , on whom these data were obtained , but also with children as young as 12 years , whose lower body weights should suggest a dose reduction . moderna tested several diﬀerent doses of the moderna covid_19 vaccine ( 10 , 25 , 50 100 , and 250 µg ) . the ema report does not lay out all ﬁndings with all dose groups , but it does show that there is very little diﬀerence in the levels of neutralizing_antibodies between 50 and 100 µg , respectively ( see figure 3b ) ; and the same applies to t_cell activation after doses of 25 or 100 µg ( see figures 10 to 12 in the ema report ) . all of these ﬁndings suggest that lower dose regimens would provide levels of immunity very similar to that of the 100 µg dose which was ultimately selected . ( of note , a dose of 30 µg was selected for the pﬁzer mrna vaccine , which is very similar in nature to moderna ’ s vaccine . ) in summary , more thorough and comprehensive dose_ ﬁnding studies should have been carried out . this would have been of particular signiﬁcance with children . furthermore , the graphs shown in figure 1a ( pﬁzer ) and figure 2 ( moderna ) show no de_ crease in cumulative_incidence among the vaccinated after 30 to 50 days . accordingly , the second injection , which was administered on or about day 28 after the ﬁrst , has no detectable eﬀect on clinical immunity . this observation should have prompted the evaluation of a single_ dose regimen , since omitting the second injection could signiﬁcantly reduce the incidence of adverse_events . however , on page 109 of the ema report [ 31 ] , we read : no deﬁnitive conclusion on clinical eﬃcacy after one dose can be drawn based on the very short time window between the two doses and consequently very few cases . in other words , no separate trial group was established to evaluate the eﬃcacy of a single_ dose regimen . the same apparently also applies to pﬁzer . 2.2.7 summary . the clinical_trials carried out by pﬁzer and moderna contain no proof of any meaningful beneﬁt conferred by the vaccine with respect to any clinically relevant endpoints . this applies to all tested age_groups , but particularly clearly to adolescents . some evidence on the eﬃcacy of the vaccines in the real world will be considered in the following section . 2.3 can the current types of covid_19 vaccines be expected to eﬀectively stop infection and transmission ? while scrutinizing the documentation supplied by the manufacturers is important , we should also look at the question of vaccine eﬃcacy from a more fundamental perspective . generally speaking , there are several diﬀerent possible rationales for vaccination . in decreasing order of stringency , the aim may be that vaccinated persons 1. be completely protected from becoming infected ; 2. have a signiﬁcantly reduced probability of becoming infected ; 3. be completely protected from a severe clinical course of the infection ; 4. have a signiﬁcantly reduced probability of a severe clinical course . quite obviously , vaccination can only stop the transmission of a virus such as sars_cov_2 if eﬃcacy rises at least to level 2 ; and moreover , the probability of infection must be reduced to such an extent that it becomes feasible , with a high enough vaccination rate of the population , to reduce the basic reproductive number to a value below 1 . this parameter represents the 16 number of new cases caused , on average , by transmission of the virus from a single established case . when it comes to mandating vaccination “ to protect others , ” then we only need to con_ sider the vaccines ’ eﬃcacy against transmission , and we can set aside the question of whether they can prevent or reduce severe_disease . next , we can ask what general rules govern the duration of immunity against respiratory viruses , and what these rules imply for vaccination against sars_cov_2 . we know from ex_ perience that natural immunity against some viruses lasts a lifetime . the best examples are childhood diseases such as measles , rubella , and also chickenpox , even though the latter can stage a resurgence later in life , which in most cases takes the form of shingles . on the other hand , people are often infected with type a inﬂuenza virus multiple times in the course of their lives . how can we understand this discrepancy ? 2.3.1 genetic variability of viruses . a key determinant of the duration of natural immunity is the rate of genetic variation of the virus in question . like any other life form , viruses are subject to genetic mutations , which in turn are subject to natural_selection . those mutations which increase ﬁtness—in case of a virus , the ability to infect human hosts with immunity to the non_mutated strain of the virus—will be retained , whereas those which decrease ﬁtness will be weeded out . both measles virus and inﬂuenza virus have single_stranded rna genomes , and therefore in principle have high rates of mutation . nonetheless , measles virus shows very low genetic variability . apparently , this virus reached an optimum of ﬁtness a long time ago ; and accord_ ingly , only very few of the mutations that arise anew will be beneﬁcial to the virus and therefore retained . this very low rate of change implies that immunity acquired in early childhood will eﬃciently recognize the virus and protect us from it throughout life . in contrast , genetic change in inﬂuenza viruses shows a rather diﬀerent pattern . with this virus , we distinguish two diﬀerent kinds of mutational events , respectively referred to as anti_ genic shift andantigenic drift . in an antigenic_shift event , entire genes are swapped between two distantly related strains of inﬂuenza virus , which usually have diﬀerent but overlapping host species ranges . through this genetic reassortment , an inﬂuenza virus strain that is infec_ tious for humans can acquire a major antigenic determinant from another virus strain that only occurs in animal species . this swap would occur within an animal host , often a pig , that can be infected by both strains . on the one hand , then , the lack of pre_existing immunity to this newly acquired animal_ derived antigen in the human population will permit the reassortant virus strain to spread very eﬀectively and cause a new pandemic wave . on the other hand , the animal_derived antigen will not be well_adapted to human hosts . this means that spontaneous mutations that occur within this newly acquired gene will have a high likelihood of being adaptive and therefore retained . the result will be a rapid accumulation of incremental changes to the protein ’ s antigenic prop_ erties . these cumulative changes constitute the antigenic drift . the pace of antigenic drift is fast enough to threaten obsolescence of last year ’ s ﬂu shot in every new ﬂu season . the question then arises which of these two paradigms applies to sars_cov_2 , the coro_ navirus strain which causes covid_19 . on the one hand , its genome does not have the pe_ culiar ( segmented ) structure which facilitates the wholesale swapping of genes ( reassortment ) observed with inﬂuenza virus strains . on the other hand , the very recent “ emergence ” of sars__cov_2 in the human population means that many of its genes should have a large scope for in_ 17 figure 5 distribution of variants of sars_cov_2 in italy , during 2021 and 2022 , according to sequencing data . plot obtained from [ 46 ] on april 18 , 2022 . the delta variant displaced the alpha variant in mid 2021 but was itself displaced by the omicron variant in the course of december 2021 . omicron has since remained dominant . cremental optimization , and accordingly for rapid antigenic drift.1two years into the covid_19 pandemic , this expectation has clearly been borne out by the emergence of several sars_cov_2 variants in quick succession ( see section 2.3.3 below ) . 2.3.2 vaccine_induced vs. natural immunity . typically , the duration and reliability of immu_ nity conferred by vaccination will at best approach , but not exceed the natural immunity which arises after infection with the corresponding pathogenic virus itself . this is illustrated in a study from italy by bianchi et al . [ 41 ] , who directly compared serum antibody titres between persons that had been vaccinated against measles and others with a history of the disease it_ self . moreover , multiple studies on highly vaccinated populations have found a certain rate of “ breakthrough ” measles infections that led to local outbreaks ; see for example [ 42–45 ] . with inﬂuenza , the general recommendation to take booster injections every year implies very low expectations for the duration of vaccine_mediated immunity . by analogy , then , we should expect a similar trajectory with sars_cov_2—that is , rapid obsolescence of the vaccines as new variants arise . 2.3.3 the succession of sars_cov_2 variants in italy . during the year 2021 , three major sars_cov_2 variants emerged in italy , according to whole genome sequencing data curated by a research consortium at the scripps institute [ 46 ] . the time course of these changes is shown in figure 5 . the alpha variant arose in early 2021 . in mid 2021 , it was displaced by delta , which was dislodged in turn in december 2021 by the omicron variant . the latter currently continues to be responsible for most new cases . this situation is very similar in other parts 1readers may be aware of the controversy surrounding the true origin of sars_cov_2 . while for a long time the predominant narrative was that the virus arose naturally in a species of bats [ 36 ] or possibly in pangolins [ 37 ] , a thorough analysis of the genome sequences of sars_cov_2 and of related virus strains indicates unambiguously that the virus is in fact of artiﬁcial origin [ 38–40 ] . without going into further detail , we only note here that the conclusion of sars_cov_2 ’ s large scope for incremental optimization holds regardless of which of the two competing narratives is correct . 18 table 3 covid infections detected among vaccinated and unvaccinated persons in barnstable county , massachusetts between july 5thand 26th2021 . data from [ 47 ] . cases % ( n ) population % relative_risk unvaccinated 26 % ( 123 ) 31 % 0.85 pﬁzer vaccine 34 % ( 159 ) 39 % 0.88 moderna vaccine 28 % ( 131 ) 26 % 1.07 johnson_&_johnson vaccine 12 % ( 56 ) 4.8 % 2.47 any vaccine 74 % ( 346 ) 69 % 1.07 hospitalized ( any vaccine ) 80 % ( 4 ) — ( 1.29 ) of the world . thus , for practical purposes , we could focus on vaccine eﬃcacy against omicron alone , but delta will be discussed below as well . 2.3.4 recent studies on the eﬃcacy of covid vaccines . data published by israel ’ s health ministry during the summer of 2021 indicated that covid was equally likely to occur in vacci_ nated and unvaccinated persons , which suggests that the true eﬃcacy at the time was not 95 % but rather close to 0 % . the same is evident from a cdc report by brown et al . that examined a cluster of covid infections which occurred in barnstable county , massachusetts during july 2021 [ 47 ] . both vaccinated and unvaccinated persons were aﬀected . the data from this study are summarized in table 3 . the relative_risk of hospitalization stated in the table is based on a total of only 5 cases and therefore is not statistically robust . we note , however , that this low number of hospitalized cases indicates a rather low disease severity overall . of particular interest in this connection is that most of these cases appear to have been due to the delta variant , which was identiﬁed in 89 % of those 133 cases where the viral rna was characterized by genomic sequencing . brown et al . do not state whether the delta variant was overrepresented among the “ break_ through ” cases in vaccinated persons ; thus , the limited data provided in this study do not rule out the possibility that the vaccine might have been somewhat more eﬀective with the original wuhan strain of sars_cov_2 or with the alpha variant . be that as it may , however—as we noted above , it has become clear that sars_cov_2 is subject to rapid antigenic drift . even if we assume that the vaccines had been active against the wuhan strain or early variants , their obsolescence due to antigenic drift within mere months of their introduction would suﬃce to make them useless in practice . brown et al . state that all of their reported cases were “ associated with large public gath_ erings , ” which suggests that most of the aﬀected persons were in a reasonable state of health before contracting the infection . other studies have reported vaccine “ breakthrough ” cases of infection both among the healthy [ 48 ] and among those with pre_existing neurological disease [ 49 ] . overall , these studies indicate that the vaccines are failing . further evidence of the vaccines ’ lack of eﬃcacy is provided by a statistical overview of 68 countries , in which the incidence of covid_19 , within the week before september 3 , 2021 , was correlated to the vaccination rate of the population [ 50 ] . the results are summarized in figure 6 . the vaccination rate ranges from 0 % to 80 % ; thus , if vaccination could indeed reduce 19 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80r2=0.062cases per 1000 inhabitants people fully_vaccinated ( % of population ) figure 6 covid_19 cases per 1000 residents versus vaccination rate of the population by country . each data point represents one country of 68 overall . cases were counted within the week ending on or shortly before september 3rd , 2021 [ 50 ] . the spread of the disease , this should be evident in the graph . instead , we see that the incidence of covid_19 actually goes up with the vaccination rate ; but the correlation is very week . overall , this large_scale comparison fails to show any protective eﬀect of vaccination . very recently , beattie reported a comparative “ big_data ” analysis on how covid_19 morbid_ ity and mortality changed in altogether 145 countries after the onset of vaccinations , compared to a “ basket ” of countries in which vaccination rates were negligibly low [ 51 ] . he found that mortality showed a signiﬁcant decrease in 13 countries , but increased signiﬁcantly in 115 coun_ tries ; similarly , infection rates decreased signiﬁcantly in 16 countries but increased signiﬁcantly in 105 others . changes were not signiﬁcant in the remaining countries . of note , beattie ’ s study includes data up to november 2021 , and therefore should include a large number of infections with the delta but likely not yet signiﬁcant case numbers of the omicron variant . 2.3.5 vaccine eﬃcacy against the delta and omicron variants . in section 2.3.4 , we already discussed several studies that fail to detect any real world eﬃcacy ; these studies were recent enough to comprise the delta variant . several other studies , however , report some reduction in susceptibility to infection with the delta variant after vaccination . ng et al . [ 52 ] carried out a retrospective study in singapore to trace infections and outcomes among 1024 contacts of 301 pcr_conﬁrmed index cases ; of these 1024 contacts , the majority ( 753 ) were exposed to an index_case that had been identiﬁed as delta . the rate of infection was approximately twice higher among unvaccinated than among vaccinated contacts , which would indicate an eﬃcacy against infection of approximately 50 % . secondary infections were not signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the vaccine status of the index_case , which means absence of eﬀectiveness against transmis_ sion . similar ﬁndings , but with somewhat higher infection rates among both vaccinated and unvaccinated secondary contacts , were reported in a prospective study from england [ 53 ] . as noted above , the delta variant has very recently been displaced in many or most coun_ tries , including italy , by the omicron variant . omicron is even more highly mutated than delta [ 54 , 55 ] and therefore less likely to be protected against by the existing vaccines . two re_ cent studies cover vaccine eﬃcacy against both of these variants [ 56 , 57 ] . both ﬁnd signiﬁcant 20 eﬃcacy against delta , but much weaker and rapidly fading eﬃcacy against omicron—in fact , buchan et al . [ 57 ] report that eﬃcacy against omicron turns negative at 60 days after the second injection , and hansen et al . [ 56 ] ﬁnd the same after 90 days . since omicron is now the domi_ nant variant worldwide , none of the mutually incompatible data sets on vaccine eﬃcacy against the delta variant should presently form the basis of decisions on mandating vaccinations . 2.3.6 mucosal vs. systemic immunity . thus far , we have discussed properties of the sars__cov_2 virus itself which limit the prospects for lasting immunity through vaccination . in addi_ tion to these , we must also ask whether the strategy adopted with the existing vaccines is really suitable for inhibiting infection and transmission . airborne viruses that invade the mucous membranes of the respiratory_tract can be coun_ tered by the immune system right then and there , or , should they manage to breach the mucosal barrier , within the bloodstream and the tissues inside the body . the mucosal defence consists largely of secretory antibodies ( of the iga isotype ) , whereas the systemic immune response involves various types of non_secretory antibodies ( igm , igg , iga ) , cytotoxic t_cells , and some other types of eﬀector cells . the mucosal and systemic subsystems of the immune system are complementary—neither can fully compensate for the other . secretory iga is essential for suppressing the local prop_ agation of a virus within the mucous membranes , whereas systemic immunity guards against the spread of such an initially local infection through the bloodstream . it is important to note that secretory iga will be induced eﬃciently only by local application of the antigen to the mu_ cous membranes , but not by intramuscular or subcutaneous_injection [ 58 , 59 ] . a careful recent study on mers , which like covid_19 is caused by a coronavirus , has conﬁrmed this yet again [ 60 ] . below is a trenchant quote from the earlier review paper by mcghee et al . [ 58 ] : it is surprising that despite our current level of understanding of the common mucosal immune system , almost all current vaccines are given to humans by the parenteral route . systemic immunization is essentially ineﬀective for induction of mucosal immune responses . since the majority of infectious microorganisms are encountered through mu_ cosal surface areas , it is logical to consider the induction of protective antibodies and t cell responses in mucosal tissues . even though this statement was made already three decades ago , nothing has changed in practice—the same ﬂawed approach of intramuscular injection has remained predominant in medical practice , and it has been adopted yet again with the “ modern ” covid_19 vaccines . it is therefore unsurprising that these vaccines have very unconvincing eﬃcacy against infection with sars_cov_2 . intranasal vaccines have attracted substantial development eﬀort , but they are not generally used . this holds true fo inﬂuenza [ 61 ] , measles [ 62 ] and also for covid_ 19 . in summary , the intramuscular application of the covid_19 vaccines must be assumed to contribute to their feeble and rapidly waning eﬃcacy against infection and transmission . 2.3.7 conclusion . in summary , the evidence indicates that the current vaccines are unable to stop the spread of covid_19 . with respect to previously prevalent delta variant , some disagreement exists in the literature as to whether vaccine eﬃcacy against transmission was low or entirely lacking . regarding the currently predominant omicron variant , the limited available literature indicates essentially a total failure of the vaccines . 21 3 the pﬁzer and moderna covid_19 vaccines lack safety 3.1 what does the evidence show ? the clinical_trials for the pﬁzer and moderna covid_19 vaccines , as well as for the other covid_19 vaccines , were rushed through in a very short time ; this has meant that proper precautions to ensure their safety were not taken . however , animal experiments carried out before the start of clinical testing already gave reason to expect severe toxicity . unfortunately , this expectation has been abundantly borne out in practice since the beginning of mass vaccinations . 3.1.1 preclinical data from animal experiments indicate potential for grave harm . all gene_ based covid_19 vaccines , including the pﬁzer and moderna covid_19 vaccines , cause the ex_ pression in vivo of one speciﬁc protein of sars_cov_2—namely , the so_called spike_protein , which is located on the surface of the virus particle . the spike_protein mediates the virus parti_ cle ’ s initial attachment to the host_cell and also its subsequent entry into the cell . the key idea behind the pﬁzer and moderna mrna vaccines is as follows : 1. a synthetic mrna that encodes the spike_protein is complexed with a mixture of neutral and cationic ( positively charged ) synthetic lipids ( fat_like molecules ) , which cluster together in lipid nanoparticles ( lnps ) ; 2. after injection , the lnps facilitate the uptake of the mrna into host_cells , where the mrna will cause the expression ( synthesis ) of the spike_protein ; 3. the spike_protein will appear on the surface of the host_cells and induce an immune reaction to itself . the immune reaction to the spike_protein will comprise both antibodies , which may or may not be neutralizing ( see section 2.1.3.1 ) , and t_lymphocytes ( t_cells ) . some of these t_cells are cytotoxic ( also known as t_killer cells ) ; their function is to kill virus_infected body cells . while this vaccination strategy may look good on paper , it has a number of drawbacks and risks . these arise both from the lipid mixture and from the spike_protein , both of which have known toxic activities . 3.1.1.1 toxic and procoagulant activities of the spike_protein . severe clinical covid_19 dis_ ease is often accompanied by a pathological activation of blood clotting [ 63 ] . the central role of the spike_protein in this complication is recognized [ 64 ] . notably , there are at least two diﬀerent mechanisms for triggering blood coagulation : 1 . if the spike_protein is expressed within vascular endothelial cells—the innermost cell layer of the blood vessels—then an immune reaction to the spike_protein can destroy these cells . the resulting vascular lesion will activate blood clotting . this immune reaction can involve cytotoxic t_cells , but also antibodies that trigger the complement system and other immune eﬀector mechanisms . 2 . spike_protein molecules may undergo proteolytic cleavage , and one of the products ( the s1 fragment ) may be released from the cell . s1 fragments that are formed within the circula_ tion , or which enter it after being synthesized elsewhere in the body , can directly bind to blood platelets ( thromboycytes ) and activate them . this will again set oﬀ blood clotting . the second mechanism is signiﬁcant because it does not involve an immune reaction ; there_ fore , it can be triggered right away even in those persons who have no pre_existing immunity . the ﬁrst mechanism will be most eﬀective in those who already have immunity to the spike 22 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 0.25 1 2 4 8 24 48lipid equivalent ( µg/g ) time after injection ( h ) blood plasma liver spleen ovaries testes adrenal glandsfigure 7 organ distribution in rats of a model mrna vaccine with the same lipid composition as the pﬁzer covid_19 vaccine . plot generated from data in table 2.6.5.5b of [ 66 ] . the blood level rises quickly and then falls as the vaccine accumulates in various organs . the vaccine was measured using radioac_ tively labelled cholesterol ( unlabelled cholesterol is a regular ingredient of the vaccine lipid nanoparti_ cles ) . the data represent vaccine content in µg of vaccine lipid per gram of tissue or blood plasma . note the high concentrations in liver , spleen , adrenal glands , and ovaries . protein , due to either infection with the virus or a previous injection of vaccine . note that the underlying mechanism of cell damage will also operate in other tissues—any cell in the body that expresses the spike_protein will thereby become a target for the immune system . since the pﬁzer and moderna covid_19 vaccines induce the synthesis of active , and there_ fore potentially toxic , spike_protein , it is important to understand how this protein with be distributed within the body . toxicity might be limited if the vaccine , and therefore the synthe_ sis of the spike_protein , remained conﬁned to the site of injection , within the muscle tissue but outside the circulation . on the other hand , if the vaccine were to enter the bloodstream , then one would have to expect expression of the spike_protein within the blood vessels and toxicity through the activation of blood clotting . 3.1.1.2 distribution of the vaccine in animal experiments . as it turns out , the vaccine does indeed appear in the bloodstream very rapidly after intramuscular injection . in experiments which pﬁzer reported to the japanese health authorities [ 65 , 66 ] , rats were injected with a mock vaccine sample . this material was was chemically similar to the pﬁzer covid_19 vaccine , but it contained an mrna molecule that encoded an easily traceable , non_toxic model protein ( luciferase ) rather than the sars_cov_2 spike_protein . the lipid mixture used to form the lnps was the exact same as with the pﬁzer covid_19 vaccine . one of the lipids in this mixture was radioactively labelled , which permitted the distribution of the sample within the body to be traced and quantiﬁed sensitively and accurately . several remarkable observations were made : 1 . the radioactive lipid appeared rapidly in the bloodstream . the blood plasma concentration peaked after 2 hours ; but even at only 15 minutes into the experiment , the plasma level had already reached 45 % of that maximal value . 2 . very high levels of the radioactive lipid accumulated in the liver , the spleen , the adrenal glands , and the ovaries . 23 3 . comparatively low levels accumulated in the central nervous system ( the brain and the spinal cord ) . 4 . expression of the model protein encoded by the mrna was studied only in the liver , where it was readily detected . 3.1.1.3 mechanism of uptake into the circulation after intramuscular injection . considering that the complex consisting of mrna with bound lnps has a rather large molecular size and therefore can not cross an intact capillary barrier , we may wonder how the vaccine managed to enter the bloodstream so rapidly . this occurs most likely through lymphatic transport . the ﬂuid within the interstitial space is continuously drained through the lymphatic system ; all lymph ﬂuid ultimately enters the bloodstream through the thoracic_duct . particles which are too large for traversing the capillary barrier can ultimately reach the circulation by way of this lymphatic drainage . the sars_cov_2 spike_protein , together with activation of the complement system , has been implicated in the causation of injury to small blood vessels in covid_19 infections [ 67 , 68 ] . similar injury must be expected after vaccination near the injection_site . the resulting leakiness of the capillaries should accelerate plasma exudation and lymphatic drainage . in addition , it may also permit some of the vaccine particles to enter the bloodstream directly . 3.1.1.4 other indications of lnp toxicity . the proposed breakdown of the capillary barrier by the lnps implies a cytotoxic eﬀect on the endothelial cells , which form the only cellular element of the capillary walls . cytotoxic eﬀects of the lnps are also evident from damage to muscle ﬁbres at the injection_site [ 30 , p. 49 ] and to liver cells [ 30 , p. 46 ] . note that these data , too , were obtained with the model mrna encoding the presumably non_toxic luciferase enzyme . therefore , these cytotoxic actions are not due to any direct_action of the spike_protein . an immunological component of the cell damage can not be completely ruled out , but it is likely not dominant in this case , since luciferase , unlike spike_protein , is not transported to the cell surface . 3.1.1.5 mechanisms of accumulation in speciﬁc organs . the high rates of accumulation of the vaccine in the liver and the spleen suggest uptake by macrophage cells , which abound in both organs and are generally in charge of clearing away unwanted debris . the accumulation in the adrenal glands , the ovaries , and again the liver suggests a role of lipoproteins in cellular uptake within these organs . lipoproteins are complexes of lipids and speciﬁc protein molecules ( apolipoproteins ) that function as lipid carriers in the bloodstream . it is known that artiﬁcial lipid nanoparticles ( lnps ) like those used in the covid mrna vaccines can acquire a shell—a “ corona ” —of the body ’ s own apolipoprotein molecules , after which these particles will be taken up into body cells in the same way as native lipoproteins [ 69 ] . the liver has a central role in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism generally , whereas the adrenal glands and the ovaries take up lipoproteins to acquire cholesterol , which they then convert to their respective steroid hormones . such a role of lipoproteins in the transport and cellular uptake of lipid nanoparticles is in fact accepted [ 70 ] . we must therefore expect that other organs with a high rate of lipoprotein uptake will be similarly aﬀected . this includes in particular the placenta , which like the ovaries produces large amounts of steroid hormone ( pro_ gesterone ) , and the lactating mammary glands , which acquire cholesterol contained in lipopro_ teins for secretion into the breast milk . 24 3.1.1.6 correlation of lipid uptake and mrna expression . in the experimental study in ques_ tion , the liver and the spleen were also shown to express the mrna that is associated with the lnps [ 65 , 66 ] . as stated above , the mrna used in this study encoded the ﬁreﬂy enzyme lu_ ciferase , which is the very protein that enables these animals to glow in the dark . mammalian tissues expressing this enzyme will also become luminescent , in proportion to the amount of luciferase protein which they synthesize . measurements of this luminescence are not very sensitive , though , which was most likely the reason why pﬁzer detected it only with the liver and spleen ( as well as near the injection_site ) but not with smaller organs such as the ovaries and adrenal glands . however , in the absence of proof positive to the opposite , we must assume that the correlation between eﬃcient lnp uptake and mrna expression that applies to the liver will also hold with other organs . if the cargo mrna encodes the spike_protein , then these organs will be exposed to the toxicity of the spike_protein , and to the immune reaction against it , in proportion to the level of lnp and mrna uptake . 3.1.1.7 potential risks to fertility and to the breastfed newborn . a high level of spike_protein expression in the ovaries raises the prospect of signiﬁcant damage to that organ , with possible consequences for female fertility . uptake of the vaccine by mammary gland cells opens two possible pathways of toxicity to the breastfed child : ﬁrstly , the expression of spike_protein and its secretion into the breast milk , and secondly , the wholesale transfer of the vaccine into the milk . the mammary glands are apocrine , which means that they pinch oﬀ and release fragments of their own cytoplasm into the milk ; thus , anything that has reached the cytoplasm might also reach the breast milk . in this connection , we note that both the vaers database and the eu drug adverse_events registry ( eudravigilance ) report fatalities in breastfed newborns after vaccination of their mothers . 3.1.1.8 the manufacturers failed to investigate risks evident from preclinical studies . with the exception of fertility , which can simply not be evaluated within the short period of time for which the vaccines have been in use , all of the risks discussed above have been substantiated since the vaccines have been rolled out—all are manifest in the reports to the various adverse_event registries ( see section 3.2 ) . we must stress again that each of these risks could readily be inferred from the cited limited preclinical data , but were not followed up with appropriate in_ depth investigations . in particular , the clinical_trials did not monitor any laboratory parameters that could have provided information on these risks , such as those related to blood coagula_ tion ( e.g . d_dimers/thrombocytes ) , liver damage ( e.g . _glutamyltransferase ) , and myocarditis ( troponin ) . 3.1.2 contaminations arising from the manufacturing process . the commercial scale manu_ facturing process of the pﬁzer covid_19 vaccine gives rise to several contaminations that may compromise vaccine safety and eﬀectiveness . for brevity , we will here mention only two such contaminants . 3.1.2.1 contaminating bacterial dna . the mrna is produced in vitro using a dna template , which in turn is obtained from bacterial cells . while steps are taken to remove this dna af_ terwards , they are not completely eﬀective , which is acknowledged in the ema report on the pﬁzer covid_19 vaccine [ 30 , p. 17 and 40 ] . contaminating dna injected with the vaccine may

host_cells and cause potentially harmful mutations . bacterial dna also non_speciﬁcally promotes inﬂammation . 3.1.2.2 lipid impurites . the same report also observes impurities originating from the syn_ thesis of the lipid ingredients of the pﬁzer covid_19 vaccine ( page 24 ) : lipid_related impurities have been observed in some recently manufactured ﬁnished prod_ uct batches , correlated with alc_0315 lipid batches . the quality of alc_0315 excipient is considered acceptable based on the available data on condition that speciﬁc impurities in the ﬁnished product will be further evaluated . considering that the synthetic lipid referred to as alc_0315 has never before been used on humans , there is no sound empirical basis for deciding on “ acceptable ” levels of impuri_ ties . furthermore , it appears that the contaminating species have not even been identiﬁed . ema ’ s arbitrary blanket approval of unknown contaminants of an unproven vaccine ingredient is completely unacceptable . the same applies to moderna as well—their lipids , too , were found to contain various unidentiﬁed and unquantiﬁed contaminants [ 31 , p. 23 ] . moreover , their cationic lipid sm_102 had not received previous approval for use in humans . 3.2 adverse_events after the onset of vaccinations . since the introduction of the vaccines , numerous adverse_events have been reported to registries around the world . we will here focus on two registries , namely , the u.s. vaccine adverse_events reporting system ( vaers ) and the eu monitoring system for drug adverse_events ( eudravigilance ) . 3.2.1 total cases and fatalities reported to eudravigilance and vaers . table 4 summarizes the numbers of adverse_events for each of the four covid vaccines deployed in the countries of the european union . we see very high numbers of incidents and fatalities across the board . pﬁzer has managed to rack up the highest body_count because their vaccine is the most widely used . the moderna vaccine takes the second spot ; it is also remarkable for its high percentage of reported events which are fatal . the totals are somewhat lower but overall still appallingly high in the american vaers database . with vaers , we can also obtain the case numbers and fatalities by age_group . these 26 table 5 adverse_events ( total and deadly ) reported to vaers as of april 28 , 2022 , by age_group , for the pﬁzer and moderna covid_19 vaccines . data from openvaers [ 72 ] . pﬁzer moderna age ( years ) total events deaths deadly ( % ) total events deaths deadly ( % ) 0 to 9

728 17.68 total 445,359 8,940 2.01 393,441 6,709 1.71 data are summarized in table 5 , separately for the pﬁzer and the moderna vaccine . deadly events occur in all age_groups , but the elderly are more often aﬀected.2 it is impossible to know what percentage of all fatalities that occur shortly after vaccination will actually be reported to vaers or eudravigilance ; however , a representative survey of the u.s. by economics professor mark skidmore points to about 300,000 vaccine_related fatalities with that country until the end of 2021 [ 74 ] . comparison between diﬀerent european countries suggest that reporting is very incomplete . for example , iceland and the netherlands report one adverse_event for every 112 and 77 vaccine injections , respectively , whereas that number is 534 for germany , 8,367 for slovakia , and 36,851 for poland . we note that the total of the covid vaccine fatalities in vaers already exceeds that reported for all other vaccines combined , over the entire 30 year period that this reporting system has been in existence . it is therefore clear that these vaccines are far and away the most deadly ones in history—quite predictably so , and all for a disease whose case_fatality_rate does not exceed that of inﬂuenza [ 75 ] and is negligible in otherwise healthy persons [ 76 , 77 ] . 3.2.2 heart attacks and myocarditis or pericarditis by age_group . it is generally accepted that , in covid_19 disease , the spike_protein of the virus triggers vascular lesions and blood clotting [ 68 , 78 , 79 ] . a prominent clinical manifestation of blood clotting is myocardial infarc_ tion ( heart attack ) . another form of cardiac involvement , also connected to the spike_protein but purely inﬂammatory rather than related to clotting , is myocarditis [ 80 ] . 2we should note here that a major chasm has opened between the numbers of adverse_events reported by the oﬃcial vaers website and by the openvaers website [ 72 ] , respectively . openvaers builds and maintains its own database using records periodically downloaded from vaers itself . apparently , vaers has been systemically deleting records from its database [ 73 ] . this report relies on the data supplied by openvaers . 27 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 5 to 11 12 to 29 30 to 45 46 to 60 61 to 7576 and upa b events age ( years ) myo−/pericarditis heart attack 0 500 1000 1500

2022 [ 81 ] . a : disease cases by age_group . another 21,459 cases of myocarditis and 5,332 cases of heart attack were classiﬁed as “ age unknown ” and are not represented in this graph . also note that the youngest age_group ( 5_11 years ) includes 7 reports of heart attack , which are not visible due to the scale of the graph . b : reported cases of heart attack by day after vaccination . since all of the gene_based covid vaccines induce the production of active spike_protein , they , too , must be expected to cause heart attacks and myocarditis ; and in fact both vaers and eudravigilance document a large number of cases . in figure 8a , the cases of these diseases reported to vaers have been grouped by age . the incidence of heart attack rises with age , which is expected . note , however , that even in the youngest age_groups , there are almost 500 cases ( 7 cases among those up to 11 years old , and 468 up to 29 years ) ; this is highly irregular . panel b of the same ﬁgure groups the reported heart attacks according to time elapsed since vaccine injection . of all heart attacks reported , one half occurred within one day of the vaccination , and ﬁve out of six within one week . this close correlation in time points very strongly to causation by the vaccine . from panel a , it is evident that the age distribution of myocarditis/pericarditis is opposite to that of that of heart attacks—incidence is highest in the youngest age_group and drops continuously with age . myocarditis in particular is a very serious condition in its own right ; it can be fatal in the acute phase and is likely to leave behind some measure of lifelong functional impairment . thus , overall , all age_groups are at substantial risk to suﬀer grave harm to their cardiovascular health from the vaccines . we note furthermore that the pﬁzer and moderna covid_19 vaccines accounted for the great majority of all reported cases of myocarditis and heart attacks , with the johnson_&_johnson vaccine bringing up the remainder ( see table 6 ) . 3.2.3 other severe events related to disrupted blood clotting . aside from myocardial infarc_ tions , the litany of diagnoses in both databases that indicate pathological activation of blood clotting is almost endless—strokes , thromboses in the brain and in other organs , pulmonary_embolism ; but also thrombocytopenia and bleeding , which result from excessive consumption of thrombocytes and of coagulation factors in disseminated_intravascular_coagulation . clotting 28 table 6 reported cases of

disease , which will in many cases leave behind severe disability . 3.2.4 miscarriages . as of december 3 , 2021 , vaers contained 2,437 case_reports of miscar_ riage among vaccinated pregnant women ; of these , again the great majority was associated with the pﬁzer and moderna covid_19 vaccines . while it is diﬃcult to ascertain what percentage of these miscarriages were really caused by vaccination—the cdc claimed to have addressed this question [ 82 ] , but had to admit in an erratum that their study was completely botched [ 83 ] —we must note that most of the cases in the vaers and eudravigilance databases were reported by healthcare professionals , who evidently considered a connection to the vaccine in question at least plausible . the high number of reported miscarriages alone would be reason enough to pause the vac_ cinations and investigate . we must also note that pregnant women had been excluded from the clinical_trials on the moderna vaccine , as well as on the other covid vaccines . continuing vac_ cination without proper investigation in the face of mounting indications of harm is completely irresponsible . 3.2.5 other severe reactions . severe reactions also include seizures and other neurological symptoms , particularly related to motor_control , and severe systemic inﬂammation with dam_ age to multiple organs . again , in many of these patients , long_lasting or even permanent resid_ ual damage is highly likely . 3.2.6 pﬁzer ignores the evidence of grievous harm in its own adverse_event database . the non_proﬁt organization public health and medical professionals for transparency has obtained , through a foia request , pﬁzer ’ s ﬁrst post_marketing report to the fda , which includes adverse_event reports received by pﬁzer directly [ 84 ] . the report explicitly acknowledges that the ﬁling of such reports is voluntary and incomplete , and that therefore “ the spontaneous reporting system should be used for signal detection rather than hypothesis testing. ” with that in mind , one should think that a number of 1,223 fatalities reported within slightly more than two months of the vaccine roll_out should amount to a “ detectable signal ” even in the minds of hard_boiled pharma executives . however , in the conclusion of the report , we read : review of the available data for this cumulative pm [ post_marketing ] experience , conﬁrms a favorable beneﬁt : risk balance for bnt162b2 . pﬁzer will continue routine pharmacovig_ ilance activities . . . 29 table 7 clinical outcomes of vaccination adverse_event reports received and processed by pﬁzer as of february 28th , 2021 . data from table 1 in [ 84 ] . case outcome number of cases fatal 1,223 recovered with sequelae 520 not recovered at the time of report 11,361 recovered/recovering 19,582 unknown 9,400 total 42,086 it is plain that neither pﬁzer nor the fda consider a body_count of 1,223 within only two months of the vaccine roll_out enough of a “ signal ” to halt the program or at least inform and consult with the public . furthermore , we must assume that regulators other than the fda also received pﬁzer ’ s pharmacovigilance report and likewise failed to warn the public of their home countries . this situation is unprecedented . 3.3 missing evidence . we saw above that strong indications of signiﬁcant risk were neglected in the clinical_trials and in the subsequent rushed emergency approval of the pﬁzer and mod_ erna covid_19 vaccines , with unfortunate yet predictable outcomes . equally damning is the list of omissions—potential risks that should have been investigated in preclinical or clinical_trials but never were . 3.3.1 proper pharmacokinetics . section 3.1.1.2 described some data provided by pﬁzer per_ taining to the distribution of a surrogate vaccine . while these studies did provide important and useful information , it must be noted that the expression of the spike_protein instead of the presumably inert luciferase enzyme might aﬀect the distribution due to the spike ’ s interference with vascular integrity , including at the blood brain barrier , and with blood clotting . ema and other regulators should have insisted that such experiments be carried out and documented . moderna reported no studies at all on the pharmacokinetics of the cationic lipid ( sm_102 ) which is contained in their vaccine . instead , they showed surrogate studies with “ sm_86 , a close structural analogue ” [ 31 , p. 53 ] . these data are not an acceptable substitute . likewise , proper pharmacokinetic studies on the second synthetic lipid component ( peg2000_dmg ) are missing . ema should have insisted that the distribution and the elimination of both synthetic lipids contained in tne moderna covid_19 vaccine ( sm_102 and peg2000_dmg ) be fully characterized in animal experiments . 3.3.2 drug interactions . the ema report on the pﬁzer vaccine states [ 30 , p. 110 ] : interaction studies with other vaccines have not been performed , which is acceptable given the need to use the vaccine in an emergency situation . since it is clear that mortality due to covid_19 is low ( see section 1.1.1 ) and therefore that no emergency exists , ema ’ s justiﬁcation must be rejected as specious . with respect to the moderna covid_19 vaccine , ema observes [ 31 , p. 119 ] : 30 study p301 was not intended to measure drug interactions or the impact of other vaccines being administered in a close temporal relationship to mrna_1273 [ the moderna covid_ 19 vaccine ] , based on exclusion criterion ‘ has received or plans to receive a non_study vaccine within 28 days prior to or after any dose of ip ( except for seasonal inﬂuenza vaccine which is not permitted within 14 days before or after any dose of ip ) . ’ immunosuppressive eﬀects of the pﬁzer and moderna covid_19 vaccines are apparent from a drop of blood lymphocyte numbers among those vaccinated , as well as from clinical observa_ tions of herpes zoster ( shingles ) , which arises through the reactivation of persistent varicella_ zoster virus [ 85–88 ] . this suggests that the desired immune response to other vaccines admin_ istered shortly before or after the moderna vaccine may be impaired . in real life , it is not always feasible to avoid the application of multiple vaccines within a short time frame . therefore , this potential immunological interaction should have been investigated . furthermore , studies of interactions should not have been limited to vaccines alone but also included other drugs , since many potential recipients of the vaccine will be on some kind of permanent medication . one area of particular concern is the experimentally apparent liver toxicity of the pﬁzer and moderna covid_19 vaccines . the liver has a central place in the metabolic inactivation and disposal of many drugs ; any interference with the function of this organ immediately creates numerous possibilities of adverse drug interactions . 3.3.3 genotoxicity . the term genotoxicity denotes damage to the human genetic material , which could lead to heritable mutations and to cancer . it should be self_evident that all new medicines , and in particular gene_based ones such as the pﬁzer and moderna covid_19 vac__cines , must be thoroughly evaluated in this regard ; and recent evidence has shown the risk to be very real . however , moderna carried out only very fragmentary studies of genotoxicity , and pﬁzer none at all . this subject will be discussed in depth in section 3.4 . 3.3.4 reproductive toxicity . with both pﬁzer and moderna covid_19 vaccines , reproductive toxicity was assessed using only one species ( rats ) . pﬁzer submitted data on only a small num_ ber of animals ( 21 litters ) . a greater than twofold increase in pre_implantation loss of embryos was noted , with a rate of 9.77 % in the vaccine group , compared to 4.09 % in the control group . instead of merely stating [ 30 , p. 50 ] that the higher value was “ within historical control_data range , ” the study should have stated unambiguously whether or not this diﬀerence was sta_ tistically signiﬁcant ; and if it was not , the number of experiments should have been increased to ensure the required statistical_power . the same applies to the observations of “ very low incidence of gastroschisis , mouth/jaw malformations , right sided aortic arch , and cervical ver_ tebrae abnormalities. ” overall , these studies are inadequately described and apparently were also inadequately carried out . the ema report on the moderna covid_19 vaccine contains similar ﬁndings and similarly evasive language [ 31 , p. 51 ] . a low risk of genotoxicity is asserted , from which the inference is drawn that reproductive toxicity will be low as well ; however , as we will see in section 3.4 , such optimism is unjustiﬁed . 3.3.5 autoimmunity . exposure to the vaccine will lead to cell damage due to the cationic lipids , and also to the immune attack on cells producing the spike_protein . from the cells undergoing destruction , proteins and other macromolecules will be released ; such material must then be cleared away by macrophages . 31 when the clearing system is overloaded because of excessive cell damage and apoptosis ( cell death ) , then the accumulation of cellular debris will lead to chronically excessive type i inter_ feron release , which will in turn trigger further inﬂammation . with time , some macromolecules in the debris will become targets for the formation of autoantibodies and the activation of au_ toreactive cytotoxic t cells—they will begin to function as auto_antigens . a vicious cycle of further tissue damage and the release of more auto_antigens will ensue and give rise to au_ toimmune disease . such an outcome is particularly likely in immunocompromised people or in those who are genetically predisposed to autoimmune disease in general ( e.g . those with the hla_b27 allele ) . the risk of autoimmunity induced by pﬁzer and moderna covid_19 vaccines could be ade_ quately addressed only in long_term studies ; as with fertility or cancer , the very short period of preclinical and clinical testing means that we are ﬂying blind . it should go without saying that all of these risks are particularly grave with children , adolescents , and young adults . 3.3.6 antibody_dependent enhancement . while antibodies in principle serve to protect us from infections , in some cases they can increase disease severity . this phenomenon is referred to as antibody_dependent enhancement . 3.3.6.1 the principle . in section 2.1.3.1 above , we saw that antibodies may or may not neu_ tralize the virus that elicited them . while in most cases non_neutralizing antibodies are not harmful , with some viruses they can actually make matters worse by facilitating entry of these viruses into host_cells . this occurs because certain cells of the immune system are supposed to take up antibody_tagged microbes and destroy them . if a virus particle to which antibodies have bound is taken up by such a cell but then manages to evade destruction , it may instead start to multiply within this cell . overall , the antibody will then have enhanced the replication of the virus . clinically , this antibody_dependent enhancement ( ade ) can cause a hyperinﬂam_ matory response ( a “ cytokine storm ” ) that will amplify the damage to our lungs , liver and other organs of our body . ade can occur both after natural infection and after vaccination , and it has been observed with several virus families , including dengue virus , ebola virus , and respiratory_syncytial_virus ( rsv ) [ 89 ] . importantly , ade also occurs with coronaviruses , and in particular with sars , whose causative agent is closely related to sars_cov_2 . attempts to develop vaccines to sars repeat_ edly failed due to ade—the vaccines did induce antibodies , but when the vaccinated animals were subsequently challenged with the virus , they became more ill than the unvaccinated con_ trols ( see e.g . [ 90 ] ) . 3.3.6.2 sars_cov_2 and ade . the possibility of ade in the context of natural infection with sars_cov_2 , as well as of vaccination against it , has been acknowledged [ 91 ] . more speciﬁcally , ade due to spike_protein antibodies elicited by other coronavirus strains has been invoked to account for the peculiar geographical distribution of disease severity within china [ 92 ] . how_ ever , the experimental research required to address it remains missing , even after more than two years into the pandemic . pﬁzer and the regulatory bodies are well aware of the risk of ade as well . the fda notes in its brieﬁng document [ 28 , p. 44 ] : pﬁzer submitted a pharmacovigilance plan ( pvp ) to monitor safety concerns that could be associated with pﬁzer_biontech covid_19 vaccine . the sponsor identiﬁed vaccine_ 32 associated enhanced disease including vaccine_associated enhanced respiratory_disease as an important potential risk . here , the term “ vaccine_associated enhanced disease ” refers to ade . ema , too , has acknowl_ edged that this risk must be investigated further [ 30 , p. 141 ] : any important potential risks that may be speciﬁc to vaccination for covid_19 ( e.g . vac__cine associated enhanced respiratory_disease ) should be taken into account . the appli_ cant has included vaed/vaerd [ vaccine_associated enhanced respiratory_disease ] as an important potential risk and will further investigate it in the ongoing pivotal study and a post_authorization safety study . with respect to the moderna covid_19 vaccine , the ema summarizes the information sup_ plied by the manufacturer as follows [ 31 , p. 126 ] : the potential risk of vaed was assessed in non_clinical animal models in mice and non_ human primates and raised no concerns based on a th1 skewed type of immune response . . . in the pivotal [ clinical_]_trial , . . . 30 cases of severe covid_19 were reported in the placebo group , while 0 case was reported in the vaccine group , providing no signal for a possible disease enhancement after vaccination with mrna_1273 . overall , it is clear that the risk of ade is recognized in theory but is not addressed in prac_ tice . given the abundant evidence of ade with experimental sars vaccines , this is completely irresponsible . 3.4 genotoxicity of the mrna vaccines : recent evidence . in the ema assessment_report on the pﬁzer covid_19 vaccine , we ﬁnd the following succinct statement [ 30 , p. 50 ] : no genotoxicity studies have been provided . this is acceptable as the components of the vaccine formulation are lipids and rna that are not expected to have genotoxic potential . apparently , ema ’ s experts were assuming that rna in general will not aﬀect the integrity of the host_cell genome . the ﬁrst exception to this rule has been known since 1970 , when oncogenic retroviruses were found to carry a reverse_transcriptase activity that could copy the viral rna genome into dna , which could then insert into the host_cell genome [ 93 , 94 ] . the realization that eukaryotic cells themselves have similar reverse_transcriptase activities came one and a half decades later [ 95 ] , but it could hardly be considered a novelty in 2020 . thus , in a nutshell , ema dismissed the genotoxicity risks of the pﬁzer and moderna covid_19 vaccines based on outdated science . 3.4.1 genomic insertion of rna viruses through cellular reverse_transcriptase activities . the ﬁrst studies to demonstrate the existence of mammalian ( mouse ) dna sequences that were derived from an rna virus which was nota retrovirus were reported by klenerman et al . [ 96 ] in 1997 . the virus in question was lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus . since this virus does not itself encode a reverse_transcriptase enzyme , it followed that the observed partial dna copies of the viral rna genome had to have been created through reverse transcription by cellular enzymes . the molecular mechanism was later elucidated in detail by scientists from the same laboratory [ 97 ] . it turned out that a retrotransposon had accomplished both the reverse transcription of the viral rna and the insertion of the dna copy into the cellular genome . 33 figure 9 reverse transcription and genomic insertion of an mrna molecule by a retrotransposon ( graphic adapted from wikipedia ) . a retrotransposon , which is part of the cellular dna , is initially transcribed and translated by the cellular machinery . it encodes two proteins that usually mediate the reverse transcription of the transposon ’ s own mrna into dna , and the subsequent insertion of this dna copy into the cellular dna . however , occasionally the mrna template may be replaced by another rna molecule , e.g . an mrna vaccine , which will then end up as a dna copy in the genome . 3.4.2 the biological role of cellular retrotransposons . retrotransposons are mobile genetic elements in the cellular genome that encode the protein apparatus for generating additional copies of themselves . most of the time , it is the mrna of the retrotransposon itself that ends up being copied back into dna and inserted . however , the retrotransposon proteins may occa_ sionally ‘ lose ’ their own mrna template and pick up another rna molecule instead , which will then undergo reverse transcription into dna and insertion into the cellular genome ( figure 9 ) . there are several homologous families of retrotransposons , of which in humans the most active and important one is the line_1 family [ 98–100 ] . since the location of new insertions within the genome is largely random [ 101 ] , the biological outcomes are quite varied . if the insertion occurs within a functional gene , that gene may be disrupted ; if insertion occurs in the vicinity of a functional gene , then the activity of the latter may be regulated upward or downward . depending on the speciﬁc role of the aﬀected gene , the behaviour of the cell may be changed , and cancer or other diseases may result [ 102 , 103 ] . while retrotransposon activity diﬀers between the types and functional states of our body cells , it is noteworthy that retrotransposons are active in both dividing and non_dividing cells [ 104 ] and also in oocytes [ 105 ] . we must therefore expect that viral or other foreign rnas may be inserted by retrotransposons not only into somatic cells , and thereby potentially cause cancer , but also into germline cells , and therefore propagate within the human population . 3.4.3 genomic dna sequences derived from non_retroviral rna viruses . a multitude of rna viruses other than retroviruses have given rise to partial copies inserted into the genomes of mammals and other vertebrates [ 106–109 ] . similar ﬁndings have been made in other eu_ karyotic organisms such as fungi , plants and protozoa [ 110–112 ] . all of these virus_derived sequences must have arisen through some kind of retrotransposition mechanism , which clearly 34 figure 10 detection of copies of the pﬁzer covid_19 vaccine mrna within the cellular dna of a human liver cell line ( taken from figure 5 in [ 114 ] ) . the cells were exposed to the vaccine for the lengths of time indicated . cellular dna was then isolated , and inserted dna copies of the vaccine mrna detected by pcr ampliﬁcation of a fragment 444 base_pairs ( bp ) in length . all samples labelled with ‘ bnt ’ had been treated with the vaccine , and they all show a pcr product of the expected length , as is evident from comparison to a dna fragment length standard ( ‘ l ’ ) . samples labelled with ‘ ctrl n ’ were controls : ctrl 1– 4 contained dna from cells not incubated with vaccine , ctrl 5 contained rna ( not dna ) from vaccine_ treated cells , and ctrl 6 the same but additionally treated with rnase , which step was also performed in the puriﬁcation of dna samples . as expected , none of the control samples contain the pcr product . substantiates the above point that retrotransposition can occur in the germline cells of all these species . while all of the observations cited here pertain to sequences derived from rna viruses , retrotransposition by line_1 is not sequence_speciﬁc [ 113 ] , and there is no reason to exclude the possibility that other rna sequences , such as for example those of the pﬁzer or moderna mrna vaccines , would be subject to the same mechanism . 3.4.4 summary . even though this had not yet been experimentally demonstrated when ema released its assessment reports [ 30 , 31 ] , there was ample precedent to suggest the strong pos_ sibility that dna copies of the vaccine mrna would be produced and inserted into the cellular genome . rather than waving away this risk as it did , ema should have obligated pﬁzer and moderna to carry out the necessary studies for excluding this risk before green_lighting autho_ rization . 3.5 the current state of the evidence . as of this writing , substantial new evidence has accu_ mulated which substantiates the genetic risks posed by the mrna vaccines . 3.5.1 dna copies of the pﬁzer covid_19 vaccine mrna are inserted into the host_cell genome . already in 2021 , it was demonstrated that partial dna copies of the genomic rna of the sars_cov_2 virus can insert into the cellular dna of infected cells [ 115 ] . even though this does not directly relate to the mrna vaccines , it does show that sars_cov_2_derived rna sequences are not exempt from the general mechanism . moreover , this study demonstrated that the insertion was mediated line_1 retrotransposons . of even greater and more immediate relevance is the recent demonstration that the mrna contained in the pﬁzer covid_19 vaccine itself can integrate into the cells of a human_derived 35 liver cell line [ 114 ] . even though in this initial study the participation of line_1 was not rigor_ ously demonstrated , the evidence of the vaccine mrna ’ s integration into the dna as such is solid ( see figure 10 ) . since the mrnas used by pﬁzer and by moderna are very similar in all respects , genomic insertion must be assumed to occur with the moderna vaccine also . 3.5.2 long_term expression of the spike_protein . while it had initially been surmised that expression of the spike_protein after vaccination would be of short duration and largely limited to the injection_site , it has since become clear that it is neither . a recent study by röltgen et al . [ 116 ] detected both the spike_protein and mrna encoding it within lymph nodes of vaccinated people at 60 days after the most recent injection . bansal et al . [ 117 ] detected the spike_protein on exosomes ( small cell_derived membrane vesicles ) in the circulation even at four months after the most recent injection . this surprisingly long persistence is diﬃcult to reconcile with the notion that the expression is only driven directly by the injected recombinant mrna . of note , the mrna contained in the pﬁzer and moderna covid_19 vaccines is modiﬁed with 1_methylpseudouridine [ 30 , 31 ] . it is sometimes asserted that rna containing 1_methylpseudouridine will be more stable than that which contains regular uridine [ 118 ] . however , while the substitution very strongly increases the level of protein expression from the mrna , its eﬀect on rna lifetime is rather modest , so that the half_life of both the modiﬁed and the unmodiﬁed mrna is on the order of no more than a few days [ 119 , 120 ] . we must therefore take the possibility very seriously that the gene encoding the spike_protein is perpetuated and continuously expressed in vivo by way of dna insertion . 3.5.3 summary . the reverse transcription of vaccine mrna into dna and the integration of the dna copy into the genome of host_cells have been directly demonstrated in vitro , and the spike_protein ’ s documented long_term persistence in the bodies of vaccinated persons suggests that dna integration may occur in vivo and perpetuate the expression of the spike_protein . moreover , the ovaries accumulate high levels of the vaccine ( see section 3.1.1.2 ) , which implies that oocytes may be exposed to signiﬁcant amounts of the recombinant mrna . 3.6 known and plausible risks that arise from the recently established genomic insertion of pﬁzer covid_19 vaccine . the results reported by alden et al . [ 114 ] , even though preliminary in some respects , pose some very serious questions that can no longer be ignored by the ema and other regulatory authorities . 3.6.1 likelihood of dna insertion occurring in vivo . one remarkable feature in figure 10 is that the pcr product which signals genomic insertion is observed in each of the dna samples isolated from vaccine_treated cells . this indicates that one or more insertion events have oc_ curred in each experiment . as noted above , the mrna in the pﬁzer and moderna covid_19 vaccines is modiﬁed with 1_methylpseudouridine , which will protect the mrna from certain degradative pathways [ 118 , 121–123 ] , conceivably increasing the likelihood of reverse tran_ scription and insertion . this possibility has apparently not been experimentally elucidated ; not having compelled pﬁzer and moderna to carry out such experiments is another glaring oversight committed by the ema . in the depicted experiments , the concentration of vaccine was higher than that which can be expected to occur in vivo . however , in the absence of evidence to the contrary , it is reasonable to surmise that the likelihood of insertion will be the same for each individual mrna molecule 36 and independent of the number of such molecules within a given cell . thus , the number of insertion events in vivo would be limited simply by the total amount of mrna injected ; and that amount greatly exceeds the combined amount used in all samples shown in figure 10 . even though we do not know how the eﬃciency of genomic insertion compares between the particular human cell line used by alden et al . and the various cell types found in the human body , we must expect , at least until experimental proof of the opposite is obtained , that some insertion events will occur in many or even all vaccinated persons . retrotransposition is particularly common in actively dividing cells , because during cell division the membrane barrier which separates the nucleus from the cytoplasm transiently breaks down ; this facilitates the entry of the dna copy that was generated from the mrna in question into the nucleus . while most tissues inside the body have lower proliferation rates than cell cultures in vitro , cells in the bone marrow or the intestinal mucous membranes divide very rapidly ; and it was already noted above that retrotransposition ( i.e. , genomic insertion ) events may occur in non_dividing cells also [ 104 ] . 3.6.2 biological consequences of dna insertion . with the line_1 retrotransposon at least , dna insertions are apparently distributed in a random fashion [ 101 ] , but they will occur pref_ erentially within or near transcriptionally active genes , since the dna of inactive genes will be tightly packed into complexes with histone proteins and therefore poorly accessible . the genotoxic eﬀect of an insertion on an active gene can be manifested in several ways . 3.6.2.1 gene inactivation . insertion may occur within a gene and disrupt it . this can lead to the loss of important cellular gene products ( i.e. , proteins ) and thus , potentially , to the development of disease including cancer [ 102 , 103 ] . insertion may be accompanied by the deletion of large gene fragments [ 124 ] . 3.6.2.2 gene regulation . transcriptional and epigenetic regulation mechanisms may be af_ fected , thus up_ or down_regulating protein expression levels of multiple genes with unpre_ dictable and undesirable results . indirect regulatory eﬀects may aﬀect even distant genes lo_ cated on other chromosomes . 3.6.2.3 activation of oncogenes . this is a special case of the preceding point , but it is im_ portant enough to be highlighted separately . the occurrence of malignancies through dna integration and activation of cancer_promoting genes ( oncogenes ) has been demonstrated in clinical_trials with a retroviral vector for the genetic treatment of children with scid_x1 ( se_ vere combined immune deﬁciency ) [ 125 ] . these malignancies will typically become manifest only several years after the completion of treatment [ 126 ] . therefore , thorough long_term in_ vestigations concerning possible genotoxic eﬀects of chromosomal integration are absolutely necessary , at both the pre_clinical and the clinical_trial stages , for a valid beneﬁt_risk analysis . this does not apply just with retroviral vectors , but with any recombinant nucleic_acid that can end up inserting into the chromosomes of the cell [ 127 ] . 3.6.2.4 autoimmune_like disease . integration of the spike_protein gene into the host_cell could lead to permanent expression of this antigen and thus induce chronic autoimmune_like disease . 3.6.2.5 germline integration . we noticed above that pﬁzer ’ s own experiments indicate a high level of vaccine accumulation in the ovaries . furthermore , line_1 and other retrotransposons are active and cause genomic insertion events in human oocytes [ 105 ] . in combination , these 37 ﬁndings indicate that the pﬁzer covid_19 vaccine gene sequence may be integrated into the dna of oocytes , and hence into the human germline . insertion into male germline cells can not be ruled out either , even though according to the animal studies the tissue levels of pﬁzer ’ s surrogate mrna vaccine in the testes are signiﬁcantly lower than in the ovaries . should this indeed come to pass—should the germline cells of vaccinated individuals be rendered transgenic—then the risk of spawning or conceiving transgenic children will not be limited to these individuals only , but it will necessarily be shared by their current or future spouses . in eﬀect , an entire generation of future parents will be exposed to this risk . 3.6.3 summary . integration of the mrna sequences into somatic cells is likely and implies a risk of cancer and of autoimmune disease . moreover , the risk of germline integration , resulting in transgenic oﬀspring , can not be denied . these risks must urgently be addressed through in_depth animal studies . meanwhile , the vaccine authorizations based on ema ’ s demonstrably inadequate scientiﬁc assessment must urgently be revoked . 3.7 genotoxic potential of lipid nanoparticles . the quote from the ema assessment_report given at the beginning of section 3.4 dismissed not only rna , but also lipids as possible causes of genotoxicity . with respect to the latter , such a statement is rather curious , since lipids are a very large and somewhat vaguely deﬁned class of compounds , which invalidates any general claims as to their toxicity or the absence thereof . but since we do know the speciﬁc lipids contained in the lipid nanoparticles of the pﬁzer and moderna covid_19 vaccines , we can consider whether or not they pose a risk of genotoxicity . each vaccine contains four lipids overall , two of which occur naturally ( cholesterol and distearoyl_phosphatidylcholine ) , whereas the other two are synthetic and had not previously been approved for use in humans . while the synthetic lipids vary between pﬁzer and moderna , they are similar in structure and function . we will focus here on the more abundant type of these synthetic lipids . these are cationic lipids known as alc_315 ( pﬁzer ) and sm_102 ( moderna ) , respectively ( see figure 11 ) . 3.7.1 cytotoxic eﬀect of cationic lipids . the ﬁrst step in the process of vaccine particle up_ take is endocytosis —the particle enters the cell , but it is initially still trapped within a membrane vesicle that budded oﬀ the cell membrane . the crucial step of releasing the mrna from this vesicle ( the endosome ) into the cytosol is mediated by a synthetic cationic ( positively charged ) lipid . after their escape into the cytosol , the cationic lipid molecules will continue to disrupt intracellular membranes , including those of the mitochondria . these are little organelles within our cells that carry out cell respiration —they generate hydrogen and react it with molecular_oxygen in order to produce atp , the most important energy_rich metabolite of the cell . disrup_ tion of mitochondrial metabolism will cause reactive_oxygen_species ( ros ) to form . these ros , in turn , can wreak all kinds havoc inside the cell , including damage to the dna—hence , they cause genotoxicity . it should be noted that with any agent that causes genetic damage—this includes ionizing radiation , but also cytotoxic anticancer drugs—there is a risk of cancer and leukæmia , and moreover there is a lifetime limit on the overall dose that can be tolerated . thus , the prospect of frequently repeated covid “ booster shots , ” and also that of extending mrna technology to vaccines against other pathogens or non_infectious diseases , conjures up a very grave public health risk . 38 alc_315 ( pﬁzer ) sm_102 ( moderna ) hon o oo ohon oooofigure 11 molecular structures of the proprietary cationic lipids contained in the mrna vaccines pro_ duced by pﬁzer and by moderna , respectively . the nitrogen ( n ) atoms will be partially protonated under intracellular conditions and thereby acquire a positive charge . oxygen ( o ) atoms are indicated ; unla_ belled atoms are carbon , saturated with hydrogen . 3.7.2 indications of genetic damage due to cationic lipids in moderna ’ s mrna vaccine . ac_ cording to the ema assessment_report on the pﬁzer covid_19 vaccine , this manufacturer did not provide any experimental data on the potential cytotoxicity of their lipid mixture ( and the ema committed a grave error in letting them get away with it ) . in contrast , moderna , in its own application to the ema , did supply some experimental data on their proprietary cationic lipid ( sm_102 ) . since the two lipids are very similar in structure ( see figure 11 ) , there is no reason to expect a major diﬀerence in cytotoxic activity . in moderna ’ s animal experiments , polychromatic erythrocytes ( red blood cells , rbc ) were counted , as well as those with micronuclei . polychromatic rbc are those which have only just ﬁnished their diﬀerentiation inside the bone marrow and disposed of their nuclei . at this stage , they still retain their ribosomal rna , which causes them to appear bluish rather than red in the giemsa stain . changes in the percentage of rbc with this characteristic indicate changes in erythrocyte maturation kinetics . genotoxic agents can cause both decreases [ 128 ] and increases [ 129 ] in this parameter . diﬀerences between sexes are expected to be small . using a luciferase_encoding mrna packaged into a lipid mixture which contained sm_102 , moderna found a signiﬁcantly decreased level of erythrocyte polychromasia , but only in male rats . the reported gender diﬀerence raises questions about the statistical_power of this study . using another model mrna and again a lipid mixture containing sm_102 , moderna found “ statistically signiﬁcant increases in micronucleated erythrocytes . . . in both sexes. ” a so_called micronucleus is a chromosome fragment which was produced by chromosome damage [ 129 , 130 ] and then left behind in the cytoplasm when the main nucleus was expelled . the micronu_ cleus assay is widely used to assess genotoxicity in vivo [ 130 ] . the ema report on the moderna vaccine [ 31 ] quotes a study done by the company to the eﬀect that the increased abundance of micronucleated rbc might have been due not to genotox_ icity , but rather to the impeded clearance of these cells from the bloodstream as a consequence of the vaccine ’ s spleen toxicity . however , no proof of this contention is shown ; and the ema report further states that “ a strong increase in molecular initiating event ( mie ) was observed 48 hours after the ﬁnal administration in the highest dose group in male rats. ” while no details are given as to the exact nature of the observed mie , an “ increase in molecular initiating events ” clearly suggests an actual increase in the rate of formation of genetically damaged cells rather than merely a decrease in their clearance . certainly , a report as sketchy and opaque as this 39 one does not provide a sound basis for dismissing the risk of genotoxicity and proceeding with approval . in conclusion , while the data provided by moderna are incomplete , they strongly suggest that their sm_102 lipid is indeed genotoxic . this agrees with prior observations of genotoxicity associated with similar cationic lipids in liposomes , reviewed for example by inglut et al . [ 131 ] . unless proof positive to the opposite is provided , it must be assumed that the same also applies to pﬁzer ’ s structurally analogous alc_315 lipid . 3.7.3 sensitivity of lymphocytes to cytotoxic agents . as noted above , reactive_oxygen_species also mediate to a large extent the cytotoxic eﬀects of ionizing radiation . a cell type that is particularly sensitive to radiation , but also to metabolically inﬂicted genetic damage , are the lymphocytes.3since the lymphocytes are the backbone of the adaptive immune system , we must expect that cationic lipid toxicity will cause immunosuppression . 3.7.4 summary . apart from the mrna , the cationic lipid contained in the pﬁzer and moderna covid_19 vaccines also pose a risk of genotoxicity . the ema erred in neglecting this risk and not insisting on its rigorous experimental assessment by the manufacturer . 3.8 ema ’ s evaluation of the pﬁzer and moderna covid_19 vaccines did not comply with eu regulations . ema ’ s evaluation process , as documented in the assessment reports [ 30 , 31 ] , fell short of the rules set out in various eu directives and regulations . 3.8.1 failure to enforce the submission of mutagenicity studies . the most comprehensive eu directive on the evaluation and approval of new medicines is directive 2001/83/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 2001 [ 133 ] . while it has been superseded in parts by later directives , most of its provisions remain in force . this includes in particular part 3 on toxicological and pharmacological tests . under the subheading ii . performance of tests , paragraph d. mutagenic potential speciﬁes that studies on mutagenicity are obligatory with any new substance . this provision is general and not limited to any particular category of medicines . both of the synthetic lipids and the mrnas contained in the pﬁzer and moderna covid_19 vaccines are novel compounds that so far had not been approved for use as part of any other medicine . thus , in waiving the manufacturers ’ obligation to submit the appropriate studies , the ema failed to enforce compliance with this binding and speciﬁc regulation . 3.8.2 gene_based vaccines are a form of “ advanced therapy. ” the above_mentioned directive was updated and partly superseded by ec regulation no 1394 in 2007 [ 134 ] . this regulation introduces the concept of “ advanced therapies ” ( emphasis added ) : ( 1 ) new scientiﬁc progress in cellular and molecular biotechnology has led to the devel_ opment of advanced therapies , such as gene therapy . . . ( 2 ) insofar as advanced therapy products are presented as having properties for treating orpreventing diseases in human beings , or that they may be used in or administered 3see in particular the example of adenosine deaminase deﬁciency , a metabolic disease that causes genotoxic stress to all body cells yet selectively eradicates the lymphocytes , which causes severe combined immunodeﬁciency ( scid ) [ 132 ] . 40 to human beings with a view to restoring , correcting or modifying physiological func_ tions by exerting principally a pharmacological , immunological or metabolic action . . . the relevance of this deﬁnition of “ advanced therapies ” is that , by virtue of the terms high_ lighted in the quote , it unequivocally includes gene_based vaccines , even though the subse_ quently issued directive 2009/120/ec_[_135 ] explicitly excludes “ vaccines against infectious dis_ eases ” from its deﬁnition of “ gene therapy medicinal products. ” 3.8.3 failure to enforce evaluation of risk of genome integration . directive ( 2009/120/ec ) is concerned entirely with “ advanced therapy medicinal products , ” which as just shown includes the gene_based vaccines . it states that a risk_based approach “ may be applied ” to determine what kind of studies will be required for approval . in this context , the “ level of integration of nucleic_acid sequences ” into the genome and the risk of oncogenicity are explicitly mentioned . section 4 on speciﬁc requirements regarding module 4 , subheading 4.1 on all advanced ther_ apy medicinal products , states that with pharmacological and toxicological testing , rationales for the choice of models and experiments must be given . this arguably implies that rationales fornotperforming certain studies must also be provided—as indeed was done by the ema in its barren statement that “ the components of the vaccine formulation are lipids and rna that are not expected to have genotoxic potential. ” of course , as is clear from both earlier evidence and the experimental demonstration of the vaccine ’ s genome integration , the ema ’ s reasoning was ﬂawed . 3.8.4 summary . the ema has failed in its duty to protect the eu population from the inherent genotoxic risks of the pﬁzer and moderna covid_19 vaccines . even without understanding the relevant science at the depth we should expect of it , the ema could easily have avoided this grave mistake by adhering to the letter of existing eu regulations on medicinal products in general and on “ advanced therapies ” in particular . 41 signatures signed at waterloo , ontario , canada , on april 29 , 2022 dr. michael palmer signed at martinsrade , schleswig_holstein , germany prof. dr. sucharit bhakdi signed at warder , schleswig_holstein , germany dr. wolfgang wodarg short biographies of the authors sucharit bhakdi , md , is a professor emeritus of medical microbiology and immunology and former chair , institute of medical microbiology and hygiene , johannes_gutenberg university of mainz . dr. bhakdi has conducted experimental research on numerous topics including the complement system , bacterial toxins , malaria , and atherosclerosis . michael palmer , md , was until march 2022 an associate professor of biochemistry in the department of chemistry at the university of waterloo , ontario , canada . he obtained a board certiﬁcation in medical microbiology and infectious disease epidemiology from the german province of rhenania_palatinate while working with dr. sucharit bhakdi at the university of mainz , germany . his research has focused on bacterial toxins and lipopeptide antibiotics , and his teaching experience includes medical microbiology , metabolism , and pharmacology . wolfgang wodarg , md , is a specialist in pulmonary and bronchial internal_medicine , hy_ giene and environmental medicine , epidemiology , and public health ; honorary member of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe and former head of the health committee of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe ; former member of the german federal parliament ( the bundestag ) ; initiator and spokesman for the study commission ‘ ethics and law in modern_medicine ; ’ author and university lecturer . 42 references [ 1 ] j. p. a. ioannidis : infection fatality rate of covid_19 inferred from seroprevalence data . bull . world health organ .

similar protection against mortality , sometimes with a moderna advantage due to slower waning . however , most comparisons do not address selection_effects for those who are vaccinated and with which vaccine . we report evidence on large selection_effects , and use a novel method to control for these effects . instead of directly studying covid_19 mortality , we study the covid_19 excess mortality percentage ( cemp ) , deﬁned as the covid_19 deaths divided by non_ covid_19 natural_deaths for the same population , converted to a percentage . the cemp measure uses non_covid_19_natural deaths to proxy for population health and control for selection_effects . we report the relative mortality risk ( rmr ) for each vaccine relative to the unvaccinated population and to the other vaccine , using linked mortality and vaccination records for all adults in milwaukee county , wisconsin , from 1 april 2021 through 30 june 2022 . for two_dose vaccinees aged 60+ , rmrs for pﬁzer vaccinees were consistently over twice those for moderna , and averaged 248 % of moderna ( 95 % ci = 175 % ,353 % ) . in the omicron_period , pﬁzer rmr was 57 % versus 23 % for moderna . both vaccines demonstrated waning of two_dose effectiveness over time , especially for ages 60+ . for booster recipients , the pﬁzer–moderna gap is much smaller and statistically insigniﬁcant . a possible explanation for the moderna advantage for older persons is the higher moderna dose of 100 g , versus 30 g for pﬁzer . younger persons ( aged 18–59 ) were well_protected against death by two doses of either vaccine , and highly protected by three doses ( no deaths among over 100,000 vaccinees ) . these results support the importance of a booster dose for ages 60+ , especially for pﬁzer recipients . they suggest , but do not prove , that a larger vaccine dose may be appropriate for older persons than for younger persons . keywords : covid_19 mortality rates ; covid_19 excess mortality percentage ; vaccine

steele 2022 ) and millions worldwide ( watson 2022 ) . conventional_wisdom is that both mrna vaccines , from pﬁzer_biontech ( bnt162b2 ) and moderna ( mrna1273 ) , provide strong and similar protection against severe_disease and mortality . public health guidelines vaccines 2023 ,11 , 971. https : //doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11050971 https : //www.mdpi.com/journal/vaccines electronic copy available at : https : //ssrn.com/abstract=4321768 vaccines 2023 ,11 , 971 2 of 14 on vaccination recommend both vaccines equally [ 1–3 ] . prior research comparing the two vaccines , reviewed in the discussion section , is limited and mixed , but suggests a nod to moderna because it wanes more slowly . however , these studies rely on observational data , and are vulnerable to selection_effects for those who are vaccinated , with how many doses , and with which vaccine . failure to address these selection_effects can lead to biased estimates of vaccine effectiveness ( ve ) , relative mortality risk ( rmr ) for the vaccinated relative to the unvaccinated , and rmr for pﬁzer versus moderna vaccinees [ 4 ] . in prior work , we provide evidence for strong selection_effects on which persons are vaccinated ; two_dose vaccinees are healthier than the unvaccinated , and three_dose vaccinees are generally healthier than two_dose vaccinees [ 5 ] . here , we extend that work and provide evidence for important selection_effects in which vaccine people receive . we then study rmr for each vaccine versus the unvaccinated , and compare the two mrna vaccines , controlling for these selection_effects . many studies have reported real_world evidence on vaccine effectiveness ( ve ) for the mrna vaccines against infection , hospitalization , and death ( for brevity , we cite principally systematic_reviews ) [ 6–9 ] . however , many studies report results for both vaccines together [ 5,10–15 ] . most studies that report vaccine_speciﬁc results have limited controls for individual characteristics , often only age and gender ; use research designs that are prone to selection_effects , often a test_negative design , which compares people with positive covid_19 tests to controls who test negative ; and/or cover limited time periods or populations ( e.g. , us veterans ) . after controlling for selection_effects , and in contrast to the mixed results from these studies , we ﬁnd evidence of a large mortality_reduction advantage for moderna over pﬁzer for two_dose vaccinees , aged 60+ . both vaccines provide similar protection against mortality for younger ages , and after a booster dose . both vaccines use similar mrna technology , but the initial two moderna doses were 100g versus 30 g for pﬁzer ( the booster doses are 50 g for moderna versus 30 g for pﬁzer ) . the differing doses reﬂect each company ’ s initial decision on how to balance the extra immune_system boost from a larger dose versus the increased risk of side_effects . yet , we know from research on vaccines for other respiratory diseases ( inﬂuenza and pneumonia ) that ve declines with age among the elderly [ 16,17 ] . there is also evidence for inﬂuenza that the elderly beneﬁt from a larger vaccine dose that compensates for their weaker immune systems [ 16–20 ] . this pattern could plausibly hold for the covid_19 vaccines , and could explain the observed moderna advantage for ages 60+ . in prior work , we propose , validate , and use a novel approach for addressing selection when studying covid_19 mortality risk [ 4,5,21 ] . we use the natural_mortality rate from causes other than covid_19 ( non_covid_19 nmr ) as a proxy for unobserved health and thus background mortality risk , within population groups deﬁned by age , gender , vaccination status , and other characteristics . we use a related measure , the covid_19 excess mortality percentage ( cemp ) ( deﬁned as the covid_19 mortality_rate divided by the non_ covid_19 nmr , converted to a percentage ) as our principal outcome measure . this measure is available on a population_wide basis and performs well in predicting covid_19 mortality for unvaccinated populations . in this study , we use the cemp measure to assess rmrs for pﬁzer and moderna vaccinees versus the unvaccinated , and the relative effectiveness of each vaccine . 2 . data and methods we study all deaths among adults age 18+ residing in milwaukee county , wiscon_ sin ( milwaukee ) , a racially , ethnically and economically diverse county , which includes 722,000 adults , of whom 19,895 died during the covid_19 pandemic period from 1 april 2020 through to 30 june 2022 . we use death certiﬁcate data , which includes residence zip_code , age at death , gender , race/ethnicity , education , income , manner of death , and text ﬁelds for cause of death and conditions leading to death . we use text analysis of death records to identify deaths due to covid_19 . our text analysis identiﬁes substantially more covid_19 deaths than the icd_10_based cause_of_ electronic copy available at : https : //ssrn.com/abstract=4321768 vaccines 2023 ,11 , 971 3 of 14 death codes assigned by the national_center_for_health_statistics ( nchs ) based on the text ﬁelds , and reduces misattribution of covid_19 deaths as non_covid_19 deaths . see the supplemental materials for further details on our text_based algorithm . supplemental materials table s1 compares our covid_19 death counts to those obtained using icd_ 10 codes assigned by the nchs . we study the mrna vaccines from moderna ( mrna1273 and pﬁzer_biontech ( bnt162b2 ) , both of which use two initial does ; we exclude persons who received the viral_vector based j & j vaccine ( for whom one dose was standard ) , mrna vaccinees who received only one dose , and vaccinees who received more than one type of vaccine . stan_ dard u.s. two_dose timing was four weeks between doses for moderna and three weeks for pﬁzer . mixing of vaccine types was uncommon ( supplemental materials table s2 ) . we treat vaccination as effective against mortality beginning 30 days after receipt , to allow for time from vaccination to full effectiveness against infection , plus the typical several_week lag from infection to death . we study the vaccine_available period from 1 april 2021 through to 30 june 2022 . thus , our sample period includes the ﬁrst half of 2022 ( 1h_2022 ) , when omicron was the dominant covid_19 variant . we measure ve and rmr for persons who received two or three pﬁzer or moderna doses versus the unvaccinated population , and relative rmr for pﬁzer versus moderna vaccinees . we deﬁne cemp as covid_19 deaths/non_covid_19_natural deaths , converted to a percentage . we measure ve against death , and relative mortality risk ( rmr = 1–ve ) versus the unvaccinated for combinations of vaccine type , number of doses , and time period . more speciﬁcally , we deﬁne cemp , ve versus the unvaccinated , and rmr for two_dose or three_dose vaccinees versus the unvaccinated in each time period , within a population group , as follows : cemp =covid deaths non covid natural_deaths ve = ( cemp unvax cemp vax ) cemp unvax rmr =1 ve =cemp vax cemp unvax we use similar formulas for ve and rmr to compare pﬁzer to moderna vaccinees . see the extended methods section in the supplemental materials for additional details on variable deﬁnitions . we report results for the following three time periods : pre_booster period ( 1 april–30 september 2021 ) , delta period ( 1 october–31 december 2021 , below “ 4q_2021 ” ) , and omicron_period ( 1 january–30 june 2022 ) , but provide results by calendar quarters in the supplemental materials . we study two_dose vaccinees in each time period , and three_dose vaccinees beginning 4q_2021 , when booster doses became available . booster availability began in late september 2021 , but was initially limited primarily to persons aged 60+ . broader booster availability began in december 2021 . cemp , rmr , and the ratio of cemp for pfizer to cemp for moderna ( the pfizer/moderna ratio ) are all ratios , so will be undefined if the denominator is zero . this issue did not affect our measures of cemp and rmr versus the unvaccinated , but did prevent us from computing some pfizer/moderna ratios for younger persons , due to no deaths among moderna vaccinees . cemp represents the odds , for a population of interest , of dying from covid_19 versus other natural causes . the ratio of cemps for two groups , such as two_dose vaccinees versus unvaccinated , or pﬁzer versus moderna vaccinees , is the rmr for the two groups , and is also an odds_ratio . these odds ratios can be either computed directly or obtained through logistic_regression . we use both approaches . an advantage of multivariate logistic_regression is that one can go beyond differences in cemp rates between two groups , and also control for within_group differences in the regression covariates . in the regression analysis of the association between vaccine type and rmr , the predictors are vaccine type ; days since most_recent dose ( minus 30 days ) , to allow for vaccine waning ; age , electronic copy available at : https : //ssrn.com/abstract=4321768 vaccines 2023 ,11 , 971 4 of 14 age2 , zip_code_level socio_economic status ( zip_ses ) , measured using the graham social deprivation index [ 22 ] , gender , race/ethnicity ( non_hispanic white ( “ white ” ) versus other ) , and education ( high_school or less versus college education or more ) . using additional predictors was not feasible given the limited number of deaths of vaccinees . cemp treats non_covid_19_natural deaths as a proxy for the health of a given group , and thus the likelihood of covid_19 mortality if not vaccinated . we assessed the validity of this approach by studying the correlation in wisconsin between natural_mortality in april_december 2019 ( pre_covid_19 ) and covid_19 mortality over the same months in 2020 ( supplemental materials figure s5 ) . 3 . results 3.1 . study population and evidence on selection_effects in the supplemental materials table s2 , we provide information on the vaccination and natural_mortality counts for milwaukee adults during our sample period . of 542,152 adult vaccinees , we excluded 94,221 because they did not receive two or three pﬁzer or moderna vaccines , and 5843 immune_compromised persons . this left a sample of 442,088 pﬁzer or moderna vaccinees , as well as 179,366 unvaccinated persons . overall , through june 2022 , around 74 % of milwaukee county adults received at least one dose , of whom 82 % received two pﬁzer or two moderna doses ; of these two_dose vaccinees , 57 % received a third dose of the same vaccine . among mrna vaccine recipients , 66 % received pﬁzer . only a small percentage of vaccinees received j & j or different vaccine types across doses . of the 10,140 deaths of adult milwaukee county residents during our study period , we excluded 1,605 because they involve non_natural causes ( e.g. , suicide , homicide and accidental death ) , 1064 because they received different vaccine regimens than two or three doses of pﬁzer or moderna , and 289 because they involved immune_compromised persons . this left a sample of 8250 decedents from natural causes , of whom 729 died of covid_19 . see table 1 and supplemental materials figure s1 for sample selection details . table 1 provides summary statistics for the sample of 8250 natural_deaths . there are large differences in various characteristics between the unvaccinated and vaccinated , between pﬁzer and moderna vaccinees , and between two_dose and three_dose vaccinees . relative to two_dose recipients , the unvaccinated are younger , much less likely to be white , more likely to be male , and less educated . relative to two_dose recipients , three_dose recipients are older , more likely to be white , and better educated . moderna vaccinees are older than pﬁzer vaccinees and more likely to be white . these differences provide initial evidence on the existence of selection_effects . centrally for this project , for ages 60+ , two_dose pﬁzer vaccinees are substantially healthier ( they have lower non_covid_19 nmr ) than two_dose moderna vaccinees , and three_dose pﬁzer vaccinees are substantially healthier than three_dose moderna vaccinees . the pﬁzer vaccinees also have substantially higher cemp levels . for younger two_dose vaccinees , age 18–59 , selection_effects are smaller . three_dose pﬁzer vaccinees are healthier than three_dose moderna vaccinees , but there are no covid_19 deaths in either group . we conﬁrm in the supplemental materials , table s10 , the existence of large selection_effects within ﬁner age_groups . for all ages , vaccinees are substantially healthier ( less likely to die of other natural causes ) than the unvaccinated , and three_dose recipients are healthier than two_dose recipients . for ages 60+ , pﬁzer vaccinees are much healthier than moderna vaccinees . for two_dose vaccinees over the full sample period , non_covid_ 19 nmr for pﬁzer vaccinees is 52.6 % of that for moderna . for three_dose vaccinees over the booster_available period , non_covid_19 nmr for pﬁzer vaccinees is 56.0 % of that for moderna . electronic copy available at : https : //ssrn.com/abstract=4321768 vaccines 2023 ,11

the following three time periods : pre_booster ( april– september 2021 ) with alpha and delta as the dominant virus variants ; october–december 2021 , with delta dominant but boosters available ; and january–june 2022 , with omicron dominant and boosters available . we present results by period , given evidence from other studies on vaccine waning over time [ 7,23–29 ] , differences in severity between the delta and omicron variants , and potential differences in rmr between variants . some death counts in individual cells are small , so conﬁdence intervals for rmrs and pﬁzer/moderna ratios are wide . for ages 18–59 , there were few vaccinee deaths and no evidence of a difference in effectiveness between vaccines . rmr versus unvaccinated persons was near zero for ages 18–39 , with only one covid_19 death among two_dose recipients . there were no covid_19 deaths for ages 40–49 and 8 for ages 50–59 ( four pﬁzer and four moderna recipients ) . for ages 60+ , where most covid_19 deaths occur , cemp in the pre_booster period was 3.3 % for two_dose pﬁzer vaccinees versus 1.4 % for two_dose moderna vaccinees ( pﬁzer/moderna_ratio of 229 % ) . in the delta_and_booster period , cemp was

estimation of covid_19 mortality for samples of persons in milwaukee county , aged 18–59 or aged 60+ , who died of natural causes and received 2 or 3 doses of either pﬁzer or moderna over indicated periods . odds ratios are for pﬁzer vaccinee mortality relative to moderna vaccinees ( p/m ratio ) , from a logistic model of prob ( covid_19 death ) = f ( received pﬁzer ( moderna is baseline ) , with controls for age , age2 , gender , and ( days since last vaccine dose , minus 30 days ) . sample is same as table 1 . signiﬁcant results ( at p < 0.05 or better ) in boldface . in table 3 , for three_dose vaccinees aged 60+ over the full booster period , the pﬁzer/_moderna_ratio was 135 % ( not statistically different from 100 % ) .this is also similar to the results presented in table 2 , for which the full_booster_period estimate is 134 % ( ci = 63 % , 283 % ) . because of the small number of vaccinated decedents , especially for ages 18–59 and three_dose vaccinees , table 3 reports results using the following limited covariates to preserve the regression degrees of freedom : gender , age , age2 , and days since last vaccine dose ( to allow for waning ) . however , point estimates are similar in regressions , which also control for race/ethnicity , education , and zip_ses ( supplemental materials table s4 ) . the similarity between the simpler estimates in table 2 and the multivariate estimates provides evidence that the cemp denominator is effective at controlling for population health and thus for covid_19 risk , even without controlling for additional covariates . 3.5 . robustness checks the pﬁzer/moderna_ratio for ages 60+ is similar if we do not exclude the immune_ compromised ( table s5 ) or exclude the immune_compromised , deﬁned more broadly than in the text ( table s6 ) . the results for this ratio are similar for men and women ( table s7 ) , and for white populations versus non_white populations ( table s8 ) . 4 . discussion 4.1 . prior literature comparing pﬁzer to moderna among other studies of ve against death , some study only a single vaccine type ( e.g. , israeli studies of pﬁzer ; manufacturer_sponsored studies ) . of those that study both vaccines , many report only combined results rather than vaccine_speciﬁc results [ 5,10–14,30 ] . some do not report separate results for homologous versus heterologous vaccination . among the studies of homologous vaccination that distinguish between vaccine types , some do not ﬁnd substantial differences between pﬁzer and moderna . others ﬁnd differences , sometimes similar in magnitude to those reported , but do not highlight them . only one study , limited to u.s. veterans , includes the omicron_dominant period ( only a short part of that period ) , or studies separately three_dose vaccinees [ 9 ] . the only other u.s. study that reports rmr using linked population_wide mortality and vaccination data is robles_fontan et al . ( 2022 ) , who study puerto_rico through mid_ october 2021 ( pre_omicron and pre_booster ) . they report two_dose rmrs after 144 days ( longest period considered ) of 14 % for pﬁzer and 7 % for moderna , versus 3 % and 1 % soon after vaccination [ 31 ] . they thus ﬁnd a pﬁzer/moderna_ratio similar to ours , but their abstract states only that “ both vaccines were highly effective across all age_groups. ” lytras et al . ( 2022 ) study greece through the year_end of 2021 and ﬁnd a nearly 3:1 mod_ erna advantage against mortality , but this result must be extracted from a supplemental ﬁgure ; the text ( at 5048 ) reports “ only marginal differences between vaccines in effective_ electronic copy available at : https : //ssrn.com/abstract=4321768 vaccines 2023 ,11 , 971 9 of 14 ness. ” [ 32 ] mayr et al . ( 2022 ) report a moderna advantage in reducing hospitalization risk , and an apparent advantage for a combined icu_or_death outcome , but the small sample_size “ precluded statistically signiﬁcant comparisons. ” [ 33 ] a study of czechia through november 2021 reports two_dose rmr , 7–8 months after vaccination , of 17 % for pﬁzer vs. 12 % for moderna ( 2022 ) [ 34 ] . the review by black and thaw ( 2022 ) reports a moderna advantage against mortality after waning ( at least 120 days after vaccination ) during the delta_dominant period , with midpoint rmr estimates from multiple studies of 13.3 % for pﬁzer vs. 9.2 % for moderna [ 7 ] . other studies ﬁnd smaller differences . islam et al . ( 2022 ) study the pre_booster period ; they report an insigniﬁcant moderna advantage for a combined hospitalization_or_death outcome during the ﬁrst 90 days after vaccination [ 35 ] . several studies of u.s. veterans ﬁnd no signiﬁcant pﬁzer_vs_moderna differences [ 8,9,36,37 ] . 4.2 . two_dose pﬁzer_vs_moderna rmrs for ages 60+ our analysis can help to reconcile these disparate results . we study cemp as the prin_ cipal outcome , which controls for selection_effects between pﬁzer and moderna vaccinees . we also study a longer period , including the omicron_dominant period through 30 june 2022 . for ages 18–59 , we ﬁnd similar performance for both vaccines . in contrast , for ages 60+ , we ﬁnd substantially higher two_dose rmrs for pﬁzer versus moderna vaccinees . the pﬁzer/moderna_ratio is at least 2:1 for ages 60+ in each of our three sample time periods . a plausible explanation for the pﬁzer_vs_moderna differences for older people is that younger people beneﬁt sufﬁciently from the boost to their immune system provided by two doses of either vaccine . beyond some threshold level , which both vaccines achieve , the magnitude of the boost is less important . in contrast , older people may need a larger dose for full protection . this speculation would be similar to the ﬂu vaccine , for which the recommended dose is 4x higher for ages 60+ [ 38 ] . this speculation is potentially testable through a clinical_trial , in which different doses are provided to similar people , and antibody response over time is measured . at the same time , studying death ( or even hospitalization ) as an outcome seems infeasible at plausible sample sizes for such a trial . these outcomes will be rare events among study participants who were previously vaccinated , and often previously_infected . the unvaccinated are typically so by choice , so will be hard to recruit for a vaccine trial , and most are also previously_infected . 4.3 . results for waning and absolute rmr versus unvaccinated for ages 60+ , where most vaccinee deaths occur , both vaccines showed waning over time , although the evidence on waning could be confounded by changes over time in the dominant virus variants . the rise in rmr levels versus the unvaccinated is higher for pﬁzer than for moderna , but the pﬁzer/moderna ratios are consistent over our time periods . for two_dose recipients aged 60+ , we report substantially higher rmr estimates than most other studies , especially during the omicron_period . during this period , two_dose rmr versus the unvaccinated population is 23 % ( moderna ) and 57 % ( pﬁzer ) . these estimates likely reﬂect a combination of waning , a higher percentage of previously_infected persons in the population , who have post_infection resistance even if unvaccinated ( thus , the relative gain from vaccination may be smaller ) , our use of cemp to control for selection_effects when measuring covid_19 mortality risk , and perhaps changes over time in the use of non_vaccine risk mitigation measures . 4.4 . the value of mrna boosters , especially for pﬁzer for ages 60+ , a booster dose provides substantial additional reduction in rmrs for both vaccines , especially during the omicron_period . a booster dose reduced pﬁzer rmr from 57 % to 13 % . a booster dose also reduced rmr for moderna vaccinees , from 23 % to 9 % in the omicron_period . for three_dose vaccinees , we did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant pﬁzer vs. moderna differences in rmr . the pﬁzer_versus_moderna point estimate is 134 % but with a very wide ci of ( 63 % , 283 % ) , due to few deaths of booster recipients . one would electronic copy available at : https : //ssrn.com/abstract=4321768 vaccines 2023 ,11 , 971 10 of 14 need a much larger sample than was available to us to assess whether there might be a signiﬁcant pﬁzer_versus_moderna difference for booster recipients . the data available to us are consistent with the results of the third dose , allowing pﬁzer to catch up to moderna . for ages 60+ , our results imply a much higher booster value than prior studies , especially for pﬁzer . in effect , the higher two_dose rmrs that we ﬁnd increase the value of boosters , because they leave more room for boosters to reduce mortality . the large gains in rmr from a booster dose are found even though we also ﬁnd higher three_dose rmrs than prior research . a uk study found 1.3 % rmr for boosted versus unvaccinated populations for ages 50+ ( when studies report ve , we convert it to rmr ) [ 39 ] . one israeli study reported 10 % rmr for three_versus_two_doses for ages 50+ [ 40 ] ; a second reports three_versus_two_dose rmr of 6.8 % for ages 60+ [ 24 ] ; a third reports three_versus_two_dose rmr of 19 % across all ages [ 41 ] . in contrast , our results imply three_versus_two_dose rmrs of 23 % for pﬁzer and 39 % for moderna . for ages 18–59 , there are few deaths of two_dose vaccinees , including only one death for ages 18_49 . a third dose is still valuable for ages 50–59 . there was evidence for waning ( higher two_dose rmr ) in the omicron_period for both vaccines , and thus for the value of a booster dose for ages 50+ . zero deaths among booster recipients aged 18–59 through june 2022 is a striking result , which suggests value in a third dose , separated in time from the initial two doses . at the same time , at least through mid_2022 , persons aged 18–49 are already well protected against death after two doses . 5 . limitations this study has important limitations . we study only mortality . the results could be different for other measures of severe_disease , such as hospitalization or admission to the icu , or for risk of long covid . however , prior work has found that relative pﬁzer vs. moderna ve against hospitalization is similar to ve against mortality [ 4,6 ] . we have data only for milwaukee county . milwaukee county is racially , ethnically , and economically diverse , but may not be representative of other areas . however , the vaccination patterns in milwaukee county ( supplemental materials table s2 and figure s4 ) are broadly similar to those observed nationally . also , although we are the ﬁrst to highlight the moderna advantage over pﬁzer for two_dose vaccinees , we are not the ﬁrst to ﬁnd a substantial moderna advantage ; see also [ 7,31–34 ] . third , we rely on non_covid_19_natural mortality as a surrogate for the underlying risk of covid_19 death . this measure is theoretically attractive . it is conceptually similar to a “ p_value ” , which is sometimes computed for all_cause excess mortality ( p = excess mortality as a percentage of expected mortality ) [ 42,43 ] . we conﬁrmed that non_covid_ 19 natural_mortality rates in 2019 , prior to covid_19 , strongly predict covid_19 mortality rates in 2020 , when covid_19 vaccines were not available , for population groups deﬁned by age , gender , and race/ethnicity ( supplemental materials figure s5 ; pearson correlation coefﬁcient = 0.94 ) . fourth , we lack data on prior covid_19 infection . especially in the omicron era , when many people were already infected , the comparison of unvaccinated to vaccinated persons could be affected by differences in the proportion of persons in each group who have some natural resistance , due to prior infection . moreover , rmrs versus the unvaccinated could be affected by prior infection . however , unless prior covid_19 infection is associated with the choice of vaccine , estimates of the pﬁzer/_moderna_ratio should still be unbiased . fifth , some deaths due primarily to covid_19 may be coded as non_covid_19_natural deaths . moreover , covid_19 infection predicts higher near_term mortality from other causes [ 44,45 ] . however , we coded covid_19 deaths based on text ﬁelds in death certiﬁ_ cates to reduce miscoding ( supplemental materials table s1 ) . for our sample , the rate of non_covid_19_natural mortality during the study period was similar to that predicted by extrapolating natural_mortality rates from the pre_pandemic period ( supplemental materials figure s3 ) . any miscoding of covid_19 as non_covid_19_natural deaths will electronic copy available at : https : //ssrn.com/abstract=4321768 vaccines 2023 ,11 , 971 11 of 14 reduce cemp estimates , but we have no reason to expect this to produce bias in the pﬁzer/moderna_ratio . finally , our assessment of underlying health does not control for behavioral differ_ ences between the vaccinated and unvaccinated . however , we have no reason to expect behavioral differences between the people receiving moderna versus pﬁzer vaccines . 6 . conclusions we provide several main results that can inform clinical practice , public health guid_ ance , and the development of covid_19 vaccines . first , we provide evidence that when comparing the effectiveness of different vaccines , one must address selection_effects for which people receive which vaccine . second , we report evidence that one covid_19 vac__cine policy does not ﬁt all recipients . after controlling for selection_effects , we ﬁnd that two doses of the moderna vaccine are strongly preferable to two pﬁzer doses for ages 60+ , at least until one receives a booster dose . rmrs for two_dose pﬁzer vaccinees aged 60+ are more than double those for moderna recipients . this suggests that the general advice for older persons to obtain a booster dose should be reinforced for pﬁzer recipients , who are at higher risk of mortality without a booster . however , the pﬁzer versus moderna difference is insigniﬁcant after a booster dose . the pﬁzer versus moderna difference is also insigniﬁcant for persons aged 18–59 , after either two or three doses . second , rmr estimates for persons aged 60+ are much higher , and therefore ve estimates are much lower than the estimates from prior research , much of which did not effectively address the selection_effects for those who are vaccinated and boosted . our rmr estimates underscore the importance of a booster dose in this age range , and the lives that could have been saved , and could still be saved , by higher booster take_up . conversely , younger persons are well protected by two_doses of either vaccine . for this population group , the lower pﬁzer dose may have a lower risk of side_effects , especially myocarditis and pericarditis , which are important side_effects for young men , with higher risk for moderna than for pﬁzer . the higher moderna dose provides a plausible , although as yet unproven , explanation for this increased risk . current u.s. , eu , and uk public health messaging does not distinguish between vaccines , nor , for the ﬁrst booster , between different ages . instead , public health agencies have promoted boosters for all . our evidence suggests the need for more nuanced guidance that can reﬂect differences in the response to vaccination by recipient age , such as those our research has highlighted . differences based prior infection status are also plausible , although we lacked the data to study them . our results suggest that vaccine manufacturers need to investigate how the immune response to covid_19 vaccination , and waning of that response over time , varies with age and prior infection . it will be important to monitor differences in effectiveness for both two_dose and three_dose vaccinees over time to determine if waning of booster protection differs between the two vaccines , to do so by age range , and to assess whether our results will carry over to new variants , when and if important new variants emerge . it will also be important to assess relative effectiveness against hospitalization , as we studied only mortality .

evaluation of vaccine effectiveness against severe outcomes in real_world settings and in populations at high risk , including older_adults , is needed . what is added by this report ? in a multistate network of u.s. hospitals during january–march 2021 , receipt of pﬁzer_biontech or moderna covid_19 vaccines was 94 % effective against covid_19 hospitalization among fully_vaccinated adults and 64 % effective among partially vaccinated adults aged_≥65_years . what are the implications for public health practice ? sars_cov_2 vaccines signiﬁcantly reduce the risk for covid_19–associated hospitalization in older_adults and , in turn , might lead to commensurate reductions in post_covid conditions and deaths . article metrics altmetric : citations : 200 views : 10,671 views equals page

for use under an emergency_use_authorization ( eua ) in the united_states ( 1–3 ) . in an evaluation at 24 hospitals in 14 states , * the effectiveness of partial or full vaccination with pﬁzer_biontech or moderna vaccines against covid_19– associated hospitalization was assessed among adults aged_≥65_years . among 417 hospitalized adults aged_≥65_years ( including 187 case_patients and 230 controls ) , the median_age was 73 years , 48 % were female , 73 % were non_hispanic white , 17 % were non_ hispanic black , 6 % were hispanic , and 4 % lived in a long_term_care facility . adjusted vaccine effectiveness ( ve ) against covid_19– associated hospitalization among adults aged_≥65_years was estimated to be 94 % ( 95 % conﬁdence interval [ ci ] = 49 % –99 % ) for full vaccination and 64 % ( 95 % ci = 28 % –82 % ) for partial vaccination . these ﬁndings are consistent with efﬁcacy determined from clinical_trials in the subgroup of adults aged_≥65_years ( 4,5 ) . this multisite u.s. evaluation under real_world conditions suggests that vaccination provided protection against covid_19–associated hospitalization among adults aged_≥65_years . vaccination is a critical tool for reducing severe covid_19 in groups at high risk . randomized clinical_trials of vaccines that have received an eua in the united_states showed efﬁcacy of 94 % –95 % in preventing covid_19–associated illness ( 4,5 ) . however , hospitalization is a rare outcome among patients with covid_19–associated illness of any severity , so most cases detected in the trials did not lead to hospitalization ; therefore , the studies had limited power to assess protection against severe covid_19 among older_adults . postmarketing observational studies are important to assess ve against covid_19–associated hospitalizations in adults aged_≥65_years under real_world conditions and to strengthen evidence from clinical_trials of vaccine efﬁcacy . a standard approach to postmarketing ve evaluation involves the test_negative design in which vaccine performance is assessed by comparing the odds of antecedent vaccination among case_patients with acute laboratory_conﬁrmed covid_19 and control_patients without acute covid_19 ( 6 ) . during january 1 , 2021–march 26 , 2021 , adults with covid_19–like illness admitted to 24 hospitals in 14 states within two networks ( the hospitalized adult inﬂuenza vaccine effectiveness network [ haiven ] and the inﬂuenza and other viruses in the acutely ill [ ivy ] network ) were enrolled . patients were eligible if they were aged_≥65_years on the date of hospital admission , received clinical testing for sars_cov_2 ( the virus that causes covid_19 ) by reverse transcription–polymerase_chain_reaction ( rt_pcr ) or antigen test within 10 days of illness_onset , and had onset of symptoms 0–14 days before admission . case_patients were those who received one or more positive test results for sars_cov_2 . patients meeting eligibility criteria who received negative sars_cov_2 rt_pcr test results served as controls . baseline demographic and health information , details about the current illness , and sars_cov_2 testing history were obtained by patient or proxy interviews with trained study personnel and electronic medical record review . patients or proxies were asked about sars_cov_2 vaccination history including number of doses , dates and location of vaccination , and availability of vaccination record cards documenting receipt . secondary electronic medical records and state immunization registry searches for sars__cov_2 vaccination records were conducted during march 26 , 2021–april 19 , 2021 , for all included patients without vaccination record cards to verify reported or unknown vaccination status . participants were considered to have received covid_19 vaccine doses based on documentation by cdc vaccination record card , state immunization registry search , electronic medical record search , or by plausible self_report if they provided vaccination dates and location . documented record of vaccination dates was used when any potential discordance was identiﬁed between self_reported and documented dates . participants with unveriﬁed covid_19 testing status or vaccination status , or vaccination with janssen covid_19 vaccine ( johnson_&_johnson ) , which was in limited use during the evaluation period , were not included . sars_cov_2 vaccination status included four categories : 1 ) unvaccinated , deﬁned as no receipt of any sars cov_2 vaccine before illness_onset ; 2 ) single_dose vaccinated < 14 days before illness , deﬁned as receipt of the ﬁrst vaccine dose < 14 days before covid_19–like illness_onset ; 3 ) partially vaccinated , deﬁned as receipt of 1 dose of a 2_dose vaccination series ( pﬁzer_biontech or moderna vaccines ) ≥14 days_before_illness_onset or 2 doses , with the second dose received < 14 days_before_illness_onset * * ( 7 ) ; and 4 ) fully_vaccinated , deﬁned as receipt of both †_§ ¶ doses of a 2_dose vaccine series , with the second dose received ≥14 days_before_illness_onset . estimates of ve were calculated by comparing the odds of sars_cov_2 vaccination in case_patients and controls using the equation ve = 100 % × ( 1 − odds_ratio ) , determined from logistic_regression models ( 8 ) . the 95 % cis were calculated as 1 − ci , where ci is the conﬁdence interval of the odds_ratio estimates . models were adjusted a priori for suspected confounders , including u.s. census region , calendar month , age ( as a continuous variable ) , sex , and race/ethnicity . other factors were included in the model if they changed the adjusted odds_ratio of vaccination by > 5 % . primary ve estimates were stratiﬁed by partial versus full vaccination . ve for patients reporting illness_onset < 14 days after receipt of the ﬁrst_dose of a 2_dose vaccine was also assessed . because protective immunity is unlikely to be achieved immediately after vaccination ( 4,5,7 ) , absence of ve within 14 days of the ﬁrst_dose was used as a proxy indicator of absence of bias in the primary ve estimates ( 6 ) . statistical analyses were conducted using sas ( version 9.4 ; sas institute ) . this activity was reviewed by cdc and the other participating institutions and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and cdc policy . during january 1–march 26 , 2021 , 489 patients were eligible for participation , 72 ( 15 % ) of whom were excluded for the following reasons : 30 had sars_cov_2 testing > 10 days after illness_onset , 19 were hospitalized > 14 days after illness_onset , eight had onset of covid_19–like illness after admission , three received the janssen covid_19 vaccine , and 12 had incomplete vaccination veriﬁcation . among the 417 patients included in the ﬁnal analysis ( including 187 case_patients and 230 controls ) , median_age was 73 years for case_patients and controls , 48 % were female , 17 % were non_hispanic black , 6 % were hispanic ( any race ) , 48 % had one or more earlier hospitalizations in the last year , and 4 % lived in a long_term_care facility before admission ( table ) . among the 187 case_patients , 19 ( 10 % ) had received at least 1 dose of pﬁzer_biontech or moderna vaccine ≥14 days_before_illness_onset ( including 18 [ 10 % ] who were partially vaccinated and one [ 0.5 % ] who was fully_vaccinated ) compared with 62 ( 27 % ) of 230 test_negative controls ( including 44 [ 19 % ] and 18 [ 8 % ] who were partially and fully_vaccinated , respectively ) . prevalence of receipt of pﬁzer_biontech and moderna vaccines was similar ( 53 % and 47 % , respectively , among those vaccinated with ≥1 doses ) . adjusted ve for full vaccination using pﬁzer_ biontech or moderna vaccine was 94 % ( 95 % ci = 49 % –99 % ) , and adjusted ve for partial vaccination was 64 % ( 95 % ci = 28 % –82 % ) ( figure ) . there was no signiﬁcant effect for receiving the ﬁrst_dose of a 2_dose covid_19 vaccine series within 14 days_before_illness_onset ( adjusted ve = 3 % , 95 % ci = −94 % –51 % ) . top discussion monitoring the effectiveness of sars_cov_2 vaccination under routine public health use and speciﬁcally against severe outcomes in patients at higher risk , including older_adults , is a high priority . in this multistate analysis of adults aged_≥65_years , receipt of an authorized covid_19 vaccine was associated with signiﬁcant protection against covid_19 hospitalization . effectiveness was 94 % among adults who were fully_vaccinated and 64 % among adults who were partially vaccinated ( i.e. , onset of covid_like illness ≥14 days after the ﬁrst vaccine dose in a 2_dose series but < 14 days after the second dose ) . these ﬁndings are consistent with efﬁcacy determined from clinical_trials in the subgroup of adults aged_≥65_years ( 4,5 ) . early reports from israel have also documented the real_ world effectiveness of sars_cov_2 vaccination , including among older_adults ( 7,9 ) . however , those postmarketing reports only represented the pﬁzer_biontech vaccine . in the current report , pﬁzer_biontech and moderna vaccine products were equally represented , and approximately one half of the patients were aged_≥75 years , providing evidence of real_world effectiveness of both vaccines against an important measure of severe covid_19 in older_adults . moreover , in assessing the impact of receiving only a single dose , no signiﬁcant vaccine effectiveness < 14 days after the ﬁrst_dose of a sars_cov_2 vaccine was detected . this suggests that bias is unlikely in the primary estimates of vaccine effectiveness from partial and full vaccination . this also highlights the continued risk for severe illness shortly after vaccination , before a protective immune response has been achieved and reinforces the need for vaccinated adults to continue physical distancing and prevention behaviors , such as use of face masks and recommended hand hygiene at least 14 days after the second dose of a 2_dose vaccine . the ﬁndings suggest that sars_cov_2 vaccines can reduce the risk for covid_19– associated hospitalization and , as a consequence of preventing severe covid_19 , vaccination might have an impact on post_covid conditions ( e.g. , “ long covid ” ) and deaths ( 2,10 ) . the ﬁndings in this report are subject to at least six limitations . first , the cis for ve estimates were wide because of the small sample_size , and the number of participants was too small to assess ve by vaccine product , age_group , or underlying conditions . second , as an interim_analysis that included self_reported data , vaccination status might have been misclassiﬁed , or participants might have had imperfect recollection of vaccination or illness_onset dates . third , selection_bias and residual confounding can not be excluded . fourth , although the analysis included hospitalized adults from 14 states , the participants were not geographically representative of the u.s. population . fifth , the case_control design infers protection based on associations between disease outcome and previous vaccination but can not establish causation . finally , duration of ve and ve for nonhospitalized covid_19 was not assessed . during january–march 2021 , in a multistate network of u.s. hospitals , vaccination was associated with a reduced risk for covid_19– associated hospitalization among adults aged_≥65_years . these data suggest that continuing to rapidly vaccinate u.s. adults against covid_19 will likely have a marked impact on covid_19 hospitalization and might lead to commensurate reductions in post_covid conditions and deaths ( 2,10 ) . topor or ††

58.1 % ) followed by pﬁzer ( n = 1096 ; 32.0 % ) and moderna ( n = 336 ; 9.8 % ) . as serious_adverse_events , there were 705 reports of pulmonary_embolism for the three vaccines , of which 130 reports ( 18.4 % ) were for moderna , 226 reports ( 32.1 % ) for pﬁzer and 349 ( 49.5 % ) for oxford_astrazeneca vaccines . the occurrence of pulmonary_embolism is signiﬁcantly associated with a fatal outcome ( p0.001 ) . sixty_three fatalities were recorded ( n = 63/3420 ; 1.8 % ) , of which moderna ( n = 6 ) , pﬁzer ( n = 25 ) and oxford_astrazeneca ( n = 32 ) . keywords : adverse_events ; adverse_drug_reaction ; thrombotic ; covid_19 vaccine ; pﬁzer ; mod_ erna ; astrazenaca 1 . introduction vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid_19 ) is the cornerstone of con_ trolling and mitigating the ongoing pandemic [ 1 ] . thrombotic_adverse_events include venous_thrombosis , thrombocytopenia and ischemic stroke , which have been reported in patients in the days following their ﬁrst_dose of vaccine with varying consequences [ 2–5 ] . thrombocytopenia has been reported as being associated with the oxford_astrazeneca vaccine [ 4 ] . this is a clinical syndrome which manifests as a high level of antibodies against platelet factor 4 ( pf4 ) unrelated to heparin_induced thrombocytopenia ( hit ) . it is referred to as vaccine_induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia ( vitt ) . similar to hit , bleed_ ing is rare with both hit and vitt ; however , both are associated with thromboembolic complications involving the arterial and venous systems [ 4,6 ] . a rare arterial thrombosis may also be considered an adverse_event associated with covid_19 vaccination as reported in a recent case of malignant cerebral infarct that has been associated with thrombocytope_ nia [ 7 ] . high serum levels of antibodies to pf4_polyanion complexes have been observed vaccines 2021 ,9 , 1326. https : //doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9111326 https : //www.mdpi.com/journal/vaccines vaccines 2021 ,9 , 1326 2 of 8 in two young , healthy , adult women within 10 days of receiving oxford_astrazeneca vaccination [ 7 ] . while the oxford_astrazeneca vaccine has been the focus , particularly for blood clotting events , other vaccines have also been reported for thrombotic_adverse_events . this has included johnson_&_johnson ’ s janssen ( j & j/janssen ) covid_19 vaccine , which was suspended by the food and drug administration ( fda ) in the united_states ( us ) and then resumed when the fda concluded that its ’ beneﬁts outweighed the known and potential risks [ 5,8 ] . a recent pharmacovigilance study reported 28 potential thrombotic_adverse_events out of 54,571 patient vaccinations linked to the oxford_astrazeneca vaccine giving an occurrence rate of 0.05 % [ 9 ] . the study was also based on data from the eudravigilance ( ev ) database in the period from 17 february to 12 march 2021 [ 9 ] . among these , three fatalities were related to pulmonary_embolism with one fatality to thrombosis . the same study identiﬁed 29 deep venous thromboses ( dvts ) associated with the moderna vaccine , of which 12 also had pulmonary_embolism ; there were no reported deaths or fatal events but there were 13 dvts with the pﬁzer vaccine in the same study period [ 9 ] . there have been several articles which looked at sex and age differences of people who had experienced adverse_events [ 10–16 ] . some suggest women have stronger immune systems [ 10 ] . in one article comparing females and males , the literature described that females compared to males have greater inﬂammatory , antiviral , and humoral immune re_ sponses [ 11 ] . in females , oestrogen is a potential ally in alleviating severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars_cov_2 ) disease [ 11 ] . in males , testosterone reduces vaccina__tion response and depresses the cytokine response [ 11 ] . that same article also covers older patients , ﬁnding that “ older patients , and in particular , in female older patients , it has been reported a progressive functional decline in the immune systems ” [ 11 ] . in some countries , differences in gender roles ﬁnd women with “ low autonomy , labour responsibilities , and unpaid care burdens were reasons for gendered barriers to vaccination that disadvantaged women ” [ 12 ] . others suggest hormone levels in both men and women impact vaccine tolerance [ 13 ] . men have been found to experience greater severity of disease and higher mortality [ 13,15 ] . however , this set of articles did not consider differences between vaccines nor the confounding impact of co_morbidities [ 10–16 ] . reports comparing the occurrence and clinical outcomes of thrombotic_adverse_events with these three vaccines remain scarce . adverse_events related to vaccines are the most fre_ quently reported among the collected spontaneous reports logged with the ev database [ 17 ] . as covid_19 vaccination is broadened to younger age_groups , and top_up vaccination for older age_groups , decision makers need current evidence on which to base vaccine recommendations . therefore , the aim of this study was to compare the reported occurrence of thrombotic_adverse_events and clinical outcomes for three covid_19 vaccines , namely moderna , pﬁzer and oxford_astrazeneca , based on reports from the eudravigilance database with a particular focus on pulmonary_embolism . 2 . materials and methods a retrospective descriptive analysis was conducted of spontaneous reports for mod_ erna , pﬁzer and oxford_astrazeneca covid_19 vaccines submitted to the eudravigilance database ( https : //www.ema.europa.eu/en/human_regulatory/research_development/ pharmacovigilance/eudravigilance , accessed on 23 june 2021 ) for the period 17 february to 14 june 2021 . 2.1 . data sources and setting data were extracted from ev , a european economic area ( eea ) wide open_access pharmacovigilance database , which collates adverse_event reports from non_healthcare and healthcare professionals in more than 50 countries . the line listing section of spontaneous reports submitted to the ev for covid_19 vaccines moderna , pﬁzer ( tozinameran ) and oxford_astrazeneca ( chadox1_s ) was accessed . the following search terms were applied : vaccines 2021 ,9 , 1326 3 of 8 thrombosis ; embolism ; thromboembolism ; embolic ; and thrombotic . taking pulmonary_embolism as a focus , serious_adverse_events were identiﬁed and further analysed according to age , sex and type of vaccine . the reports identiﬁed were then exported to microsoft excel ﬁles and classiﬁed according to the following variables : age ( age_groups : 85 years old , 65–84 and 18–64 years old ) , sex , month of reporting , origin of the report , reporter ’ s profession ( healthcare professional or non_healthcare professional ) and concomitant con_ ditions . data were tabulated and presented along with the clinical outcomes which were categorised into four sections : ( i ) recovered , ( ii ) recovering , ( iii ) not yet recovered , and ( iv ) fatal outcome . ethical review was not required for the open_access data . the access policy of european medicines agency ( ema ) states that “ no authorisation for accessing the icsr ( level 1 ) data set by means of the adrreports.eu portal is required , i.e. , all academic researchers can access adverse_reaction data of interest ” [ 17 ] . 2.2 . statistical_analysis data were analysed using descriptive_statistics to determine the study population characteristics . variables were reported as absolute numbers and percentages . all analyses were performed using spss for windows 20.0 ( spss , chicago , il , usa ) . differences in proportions between the groups were compared with the chi_square test and monthly trends in reporting were analysed . a p_value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant . 3 . results 3.1 . frequency of adverse_events during the study period , a total of 729,496 adverse_events were reported for the three vaccines : oxford_astrazeneca ( n = 337,712 ;

58.1 % ) . however , the present study and other pharmacovigilance research demonstrated that thrombosis with thrombocytopenia appears to occur with all three vac__cines , with higher rates in those who had received the oxford_astrazeneca vaccine [ 23,25 ] . it has been suggested that administration of the oxford_astrazeneca vaccine should be considered carefully and only when the potential beneﬁt outweighs any potential risks , particularly in patients with a history of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis , acquired or hereditary thrombophilia , or heparin_induced thrombocytopenia [ 26,27 ] . pulmonary_embolism ( pe ) is an acute complication of dvt and is considered a serious adverse_event [ 28 ] and the third most common cause of cardiovascular death [ 29 ] . in this study , among the severe clinical outcomes associated with the three vaccines , 705 reports included pulmonary_embolism with 63 fatalities ; however , this ﬁnding should be interpreted with great caution given the nature of the present data and the passive reporting system used . the limitations of this study , as with spontaneous reporting schemes of adverse_reactions of both drugs and vaccines , is hampered by underreporting , over reporting and reporting bias . this makes it difﬁcult to identify the true incidence of these events and the presence of multiple confounders which may not enable the assessment of the causality with higher speciﬁcity [ 30 ] . in addition , due to the nature of the database , it was not possible to know the denominator ( the total_number of vaccinated individuals for each type of vaccine ) , which hinders the analysis of the likelihood of the true occurrence of thrombotic_adverse_events for each vaccine . we were also unable to report possible concomitant drugs . despite these limitations , the study used global real_world data and collected valuable information about three widely used vaccines , where more than two thirds of all reports were received from healthcare professionals , which increases the credibility and quality of reports . people who are vaccine hesitant and reluctant to take any of the mentioned vac__cines [ 31 ] should know that most covid_19 vaccines are effective at preventing symp_ tomatic infection including hospital admissions and severe_disease [ 32,33 ] . the risk of covid_19 vaccine related thrombotic events are minimal and likely manageable with available treatments [ 9 ] . thrombotic_adverse_events reported for the three vaccines remains extremely rare [ 9,34 ] . 5 . conclusions in summary , thrombotic_adverse_events reported for the three vaccines remains ex_ tremely rare with multiple causative factors reported elsewhere as precipitating these events . practicing vigilance and proper clinical management for the affected vaccines , as well as continuing to report adverse_events , is essential . future research should consider sex and age differences of adverse_events with covid_19 vaccines . results can inﬂuence vaccination programmes and policy makers ’ decision making . author contributions : conceptualisation m.t . and h.e . ;

1663abstract . – objective : the “ severe acute re _ spiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars_cov_2 ) ” disease has caused a worldwide challenging and threatening pandemic ( covid_19 ) , with huge health and economic losses . the us food and drug administration , ( fda ) has granted emergen _ cy use authorization for treatment with the pfizer/ biontech and moderna covid_19 vaccines . ma _ ny people have a history of a significant allergic_reaction to a specific food , medicine , or vaccine ; hence , people all over the world have great con _ cerns about these two authorized vaccines . this article compares the pharmacology , indications , contraindications , and adverse_effects of the pfiz _ er/biontech and moderna vaccines . materials and methods : the required documents and information were collected from the relevant databases , including web of science ( clarivate analytics ) , pubmed , embase , world_health_organization ( who ) , food and drug au _ thorities ( fda ) usa , local ministries , health in _ stitutes , and google scholar . the key terms used were : coronavirus , sars_cov_2 , covid_19 pan _ demic , vaccines , pfizer/biontech vaccine , mod _ erna vaccine , pharmacology , benefits , allergic responses , indications , contraindications , and adverse_effects . the descriptive information was recorded , and we eventually included 12 docu _ ments including research articles , clinical_trials , and websites to record the required information . results : based on the currently available literature , both vaccines are beneficial to pro _ vide immunity against sars_cov_2_infection . pfizer/biontech vaccine has been recommend _ ed to people 16 years_of_age and older , with a dose of 30 μg ( 0.3 m ) at a cost of $ 19.50 . it pro _ vides immunogenicity for at least 119 days af _ ter the first vaccination and is_95 % effective in preventing the sars_cov_2_infection . howev _ er , moderna vaccine has been recommended to people 18 years_of_age and older , with a dose of 50 μg ( 0.5 ml ) at a cost of $ 32_37 . it provides im _ munogenicity for at least 119 days after the first vaccination and is 94.5 % effective in preventing the sars_cov_2_infection . however , some as _ sociated allergic symptoms have been reported for both vaccines . the covid_19 vaccines can cause mild adverse_effects after the first or sec _ ond doses , including pain , redness or swelling at the site of vaccine shot , fever , fatigue , head _ ache , muscle pain , nausea , vomiting , itching , chills , and joint_pain , and can also rarely cause anaphylactic shock . the occurrence of adverse_effects is reported to be lower in the pfizer/bi _ ontech vaccine compared to the moderna vac _ cine ; however , the moderna vaccine compared to the pfizer vaccine is easier to transport and store because it is less temperature sensitive . conclusions : the fda has granted emer _ gency use authorization for the pfizer/biontech and moderna covid_19 vaccines . these vac _ cines can protect recipients from a sars_cov_ 2 infection by formation of antibodies and provide immunity against a sars_cov_2_infection . both vaccines can cause various adverse_effects , but these reactions are reported to be less frequent in the pfizer/biontech vaccine compared to the moderna covid_19 vaccine ; however , the mod _ erna vaccine compared to the pfizer vaccine is easier to transport and store because it is less temperature sensitive . key words : sars_cov_2 vaccine , pfizer/biontech , moderna vac _ cine , pharmacology , adverse_effects .

covid_19 ) . this virus is highly contagious and has caused disruption of the world ’ s health and economy1 . the prevalence and mortality rates of sarscov_2 are changing on a daily basis2 . according to world_health_organization ( who ) as of december 25 , 2020 , the covid_19 pandemic involved 216 countries , and had affect _ ed 80.161.578,00 people with a fatality rate of 1.756.379,00 ( 2.19 % ) 3 . during the covid_19 pandemic , globally people are facing major health care challenges , lockdowns , anxiety and stress4 , as there is no spe _ cific treatment and vaccination for this pandem _ ic . given the lack of specific therapy for and the rapid spread of this virus , vaccination would be a significant tool in the fight against the sars__cov_2 pandemic . more recently , on december 11 , 2020 and december 18 , 2020 , respectively , the us food and drug administration ( fda ) , grant _ ed emergency authorization to the pfizer/bion _ tech5,6 and moderna covid_19 vaccines7 . these two covid_19 vaccines were developed quick _ ly to benefit humanity and arrest the rise in the number of sars_cov_2 cases . from the time when the sars_cov_2 genome was released in early 20208 until these two vaccines received eua status , less than one year passed . the fast _ est any vaccine had previously been developed , from viral sampling to approval , was four years , for mumps in the 1960s9 . there have been some concerns about potential adverse_effects of these vaccines . the present study aims to highlight ev _ idence about the pharmacological characteristics , indications , contraindications and adverse_effects of pfizer/biontech and moderna vaccines . materials and methods the required informations were collected from relevant databases , regarding the pharmacology , indications , contraindications , and adverse_effects of pfizer/biontech and moderna vaccines . we reviewed the literature from various databases including “ web of science clarivate analytics10 , pubmed11 , “ medline , embase , world_health_organization ( who ) , us food and drug admin _ istration ( fda ) , centers_for_disease_control and prevention ( cdc ) , regional ministries , health in _

pharmacological characteristics , benefits , aller _ gic responses , indications , contraindications , and adverse_effects . the descriptive information was recorded and 42 articles , documents were identi _ fied . the studies , international organizations , and weblinks in which sars_cov_2 and covid_19 pandemic vaccine were discussed were eligi _ ble for inclusion . no limitations on publication status , study design , or language of publication were imposed . the descriptive information was retrieved from the selected literature . two co_au_ thors reviewed the literature , and their findings were entered into tabular form . after that , a third co_author rechecked the literature and their find _ ings . from the 24 identified documents , finally we included 12 documents including publications and few organizations such as “ world health or _ ganization ( who ) , us food and drug admin _ istration ( fda ) , centers_for_disease_control and prevention ( cdc ) . data extraction and ethics statement the findings were documented by using a stan _ dardized form including a full description of the study characteristics . in this study we recorded the publicly available database literature on coro _ navirus , sars_cov_2 , covid_19 vaccine , pfiz _ er/biontech and moderna vaccines ; hence , ethi _ cal approval was not required . results table i presents a comparison between the pharmacology , indications , and adverse_effects of pfizer/biontech and moderna vaccines . the us food and drug authorities ( fda ) have granted emergency authorization for use of the pfizer/bi _ ontech and moderna vaccines . pfizer/biontech vaccine has been recommended to people 16 years_of_age and older , with a dose of 30 μg ( 0.3 ml ) at a cost of $ 19.50 . it provides immunogenicity for at least about 119 days after the first vaccination and is_95 % effective in preventing the sars__cov_2 infection . however , moderna vaccine has been recommended to people 18 years_of_age and older ,

because there has been no specific treatment , and until december 2020 no vaccination for this pandemic . in mid_december 2020 , the us food and drug authority , ( fda ) , granted emergency authorization for the use of the pfizer/biontech5,6 and moderna covid_19 vac _ cines7 . there is reasonable evidence that both pfizer_biontech covid19 vaccine and moder _ na covid_19 vaccine may be effective to combat the covid_19 pandemic . in this study we com _ pared the pharmacology , indications , contraindi _ cations , and adverse_effects of pfizer/biontech and moderna vaccines . it has been more than one year since the coro _ navirus outbreak began and the pandemic became a global catastrophe . with a global lockdown amidst a fear of increasing morbidity and mortal _ ity , countries have witnessed their economies col _ lapse and health systems devolve in crisis while hoping for a miraculous cure in the form of a vac _ cine for this new ailment . after a year , the autho _ rization of the pfizer vaccine on dec 11 , 20205 and moderna vaccine on dec 18 , 20206 have brought forth a global ray of optimism for ending the fight against covid_19 . both authorized vaccines use modified rna to encode the sars_cov_2 spike_protein along with mutations in the mrna added to lock the spike_proteins into a three_dimensional shape that it naturally assumes just before it binds to the human ace_2 receptors on cells with which elicited virus_neutralizing antibodies must in _ teract25 . both also use lipid nanoparticle ( lnp ) delivery system26 . these represent a new class of vaccine , which offer potential advantages , com _ pared to traditional replicating or non_replicating viral vector vaccines , in that rna vaccines are very potent and can be manufactured rapidly and at a relatively low cost . they have a good safety profile , compared to viral vaccines , since they are not made with an actual pathogen and do not in _ tegrate into host dna . both are administered in two doses into the deltoid muscle . a disadvantage of this class of vaccines is that because rna is unstable , they require extreme refrigeration for stability during distribution . the two approved vaccines , made available after thorough testing at almost the same time , have certain differences in their properties and actions on the body . the pfizer vaccine is giv _ en in two slightly smaller dosages of 30 μg14,15 , whereas the moderna vaccine is given in two 50 μg dosages16,17 . the pfizer vaccine is approved for ages 16 years up , whereas the moderna vaccine is approved for ages 18 years and up . the efficacy reported for the pfizer vaccine , at 95 % 14 is very slightly more than that reported for the moderna vaccine at 94.5 % 16 . however , differences between the two arise when their factors of cost , storage_requirements , and beneficial or adverse_effects are considered . the pfizer vaccine is significantly less costly than the moderna vaccine , and their costs are $ 19.50 usd and $ 32_37 usd , respectively18 . while certain developed nations are vaccinating their citizens free of charge , others are charging the public and must consider whether the vaccine is affordable by all the citizens , because the health and lives of all individuals of a society are equally important and universal vaccination is an excel _ lent way to reach herd_immunity . special consid _ eration must be taken by low_income countries where the average person can simply afford the vaccine or not , and if so , then cost would be a consideration . however , despite its lower cost , the pfizer vaccine ’ s major issue lies with its storage temperature between _80ºc and _60ºc ( _112ºf to _76ºf ) 19 , whereas the moderna vaccine is stored at a relatively much higher temperature between _25º and _15ºc20 that is easier to maintain . this temperature requirement can pose a challenge to low_income countries , many of which also face an energy crisis , as to how they will manage such low storage temperature conditions to ensure the promising results of both the vaccines , especial _ ly the pfizer vaccine , with although cheaper , re _ quires much lower and more difficult to maintain storage temperatures . published data has shown that both vaccines elicit a similar humoral re _ sponse , and the published literature reports no difference in cellular immunity . there is , howev _ er , preliminary unpublished evidence that pfizer ’ s covid_19 vaccine may trigger stronger cd8 t_cell responses than moderna ’ s vaccine27 . this cellular response might provide added protection against an infection . regarding their adverse_effects , both vaccines have in some cases produced serious adverse ef _ fects , and in rare cases , have produced severe aller _ gic reactions , including anaphylaxis . despite these issues that concern the vaccines , to date , pfizer and moderna vaccine are the only widely available vaccinations in the fight against corona . countries , despite cost , are trying their best to vaccinate their citizens as early as possible , but further research is required to ensure that potential adverse_effects are not triggered by any covid_19 vaccines28 and that planned phase 4 post marketing trials are also s.a. meo , i.a . bukhari , j. akram , a.s. meo , d.c. klonoff1668complete for the vaccines to ensure their safety . so far , both covid_19 vaccines have their own pros and cons and appear to be effective . the incidence of adverse_effects is reported to be lower with the pfizer/biontech vaccine than with the moderna vaccine ; however , the moderna vaccine compared to the pfizer vaccine is easier to transport and store because it is less temperature sensitive . with fur _ ther research , the science community will hope _ fully bring forth new radical measures to fight this disease and finally bring an end to this pandemic . study strengths and limitations this is the first study in the literature , to our knowledge , to highlight a comparison between the biology , pharmacology , indications , contra _ indications and adverse_effects of the pfizer/bi _ ontech and moderna vaccines for a better under _ standing of these two vaccines . conclusions the fda has authorized , on an emergency ba _ sis , the pfizer/biontech and moderna vaccines . these two vaccines can provide protection from sars_cov_ 2 infection by formation of antibod _ ies , to provide immunity against a sars_cov_2_infection , with humoral as well as possibly cel _ lular immunity , which has led to great hope for ending the covid_19 pandemic . the available evidence supports the conclusion that both vac _ cines are beneficial , but may cause some adverse_effects including pain , redness or swelling at the site of vaccine shot , nausea , vomiting , fever , fa _ tigue , headache , muscle pain , itching , chills , and joint_pain , as well as in rare cases they may cause an anaphylactic reaction . the occurrence of these adverse_effects is reported to be lower with the pfizer/biontech vaccine than with the moderna vaccine . however , the moderna vaccine com _ pared to the pfizer vaccine is easier to transport and store because it is less temperature sensitive . it must be noted that because clinical_trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , ad _ verse reaction rates observed in the clinical_trials of a vaccine can not be directly compared with rates in the clinical_trials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice . acknowledgement thanks to “ researchers supporting project number (

public health achievements of the contemporary world . while pharmaceutical companies are actively developing new vaccines , and demonstrating results of effectiveness and safety profiles , concerns on covid_‑19 vaccine management are under ‑reported . we aimed to synthesise the evidence for efficient cold_chain management of covid vaccines . methods : the scoping review ’ s conduct and reporting were based on the prisma–scr 2018 checklist . we searched from april 2020 to january 2022 for publications in pubmed ( litcovid ) , scopus and sciencedirect . all review stages were pilot ‑tested to calibrate 2 reviewers . articles on cold_chain logistics and management were included , while publications solely describing covid vaccines , their development and clinical aspects of the vaccine , were excluded . to capture relevant data , charting was conducted by one reviewer and verified by another . results were analysed thematically and summarised descriptively in a table and in‑text . results and discussion : we assessed 6984 potentially relevant citations . we included 14 publications originating from usa ( n = 6 ) , india ( n = 2 ) , finland , spain , bangladesh , netherlands , switzerland and ethiopia . they were reported as reviews ( 4 ) , policy or guidance documents ( 3 ) , experimental studies ( 2 ) , case_reports ( 2 ) , expert commentary ( 1 ) , phenomenological study ( 1 ) , and decision‑making trial and evaluation laboratory trial ( 1 ) . the findings were presented in three themes : ( i ) regulatory requirements for cold‑ chain logistics , ( ii ) packaging and storage , and ( iii ) transportation and distribution . a conceptual_framework emerged linking regulatory requirements , optimal logistics operation and formulation stability as the key to efficient cold_chain management . recommendations were made for improving formulation stability , end‑product storage conditions , and incorporating monitoring technologies . conclusion : covid_‑19 vaccines require special end‑to ‑end supply cold_chain requirements , from manufacture , and transportation to warehouses and healthcare facilities . to sustain production , minimise wastage , and for vaccines to reach target populations , an efficient and resilient vaccine supply_chain which is assisted by temperature monitoring technologies is imperative . keywords : cold_chain logistics , mrna vaccines ,

an initial $ 6.5 billion ( £4.8 billion equivalent ) in covid_19 therapeu _ tics and vaccines—an effort aimed at delivering 300 mil _ lion doses of vaccines , with first doses made available as early as january 2021 [ 1 ] . the amount included at least $ 1 billion ( £738 million equivalent ) each to novavax , the university of oxford and astrazeneca , glaxosmithkline and sanofi , and johnson_&_johnson . similarly , the uk government in the early stages purchased a total of 340 million_doses at fixed prices , while australia had invested approximately a $ 3.3 billion ( £1.7 billion equivalent ) for five different vaccines [ 1 ] . recently , the world_health_organisation ( who ) , by observations of superspreading events , uncovered that covid_19 transmissions are airborne and that contain _ ing the outbreak will , therefore , be challenging [ 2 ] . the organisation recommends that general ventilation is supplemented with airborne infection controls , such as local exhaust , high efficiency air filtration , and germi _ cidal ultraviolet lights , particularly in hospitals , schools , public buildings , workplace environments , and aged care homes . on the parallel , maintaining hygiene and good hand_washing techniques , practising social distancing , efficient contact tracing and mass_testing , and droplet precautions are still advocated , at the time of writing . evidently , administering vaccines including booster shots on this scale and at this speed has never been done . pharmaceutical companies are focused on meeting the demands for covid_19 vaccine supply , and on demon _ strating results of good immune responses and reasona _ ble safety profiles of their respective candidate vaccines in all special interest groups . up until may 2021 , of the 170 vaccine candidates for covid_19 developed , researchers were testing 90 vaccines in ongoing human clinical_trials , with 27 having reached phase 3 and approved to be used for the population in various countries and currently undergoing post_marketing surveillance for adverse effect following immunisations [ 3 ] . while we constantly face the risks of adverse_effects developing post_immuni _ sation , and more potent variants emerging and creating new waves of infections , we continue to rely on the active acquired immunity offered by the covid_19 vaccines . the global data for covid_19 vaccination policy demonstrated that the delivery and outreach of the vac _ cines for the different groups have been largely univer _ sal or that at least the vulnerable groups were targeted [ 4 ] . an exception existed for eritrea , where none of its population was provided with the vaccine . in afghani _ stan and liberia , the vaccines were available for either their key workers or clinically vulnerable groups or the older_age groups . the saudi government recorded that by early february 2022 , 59 million_doses were suc _ cessfully administered , of which 1 million_doses were allotted for older_adults [ 4 ] . while a few countries had failed to report their data on vaccination provision , a majority of the countries had setup special task forces for managing the vaccines and related data . the sce _ nario is no different in southeast_asia . in malaysia for instance , a special committee , known as the special committee for ensuring access to covid_19 vaccine supply , jkvav , is responsible for ensuring timely access to the covid_19 vaccine supply . alongside the jkjav , the npra plays a vital role in ensuring vaccines ’ effi _ cacy , quality , and safety . six of the covid_19 vaccines , from pfizer_biontech ( cominarty ) , oxford_astra _ zeneca ( vaxzevria ) , sinovac ( coronavac ) , covilo ( sinopharm ) , johnson_&_johnson ( janssen covid_19 vaccine ) , and cansino ( convidecia ) had received con _ ditional approval from the regulatory_agency [ 5 ] . fol _ lowing waves of rising infections , as of 10th february 2022 , 98 % of the country ’ s adult population eligible for vaccination had completed the required doses and were successfully inoculated , while 53.9 % had received their booster shots [ 6 ] . the plan to vaccinate adolescents and toddlers as young as 5 , and other special interest popu _ lation groups has been approved and being rolled out in phases [ 7 ] . issues related to mass production , storage and distribu _ tion of covid_19 vaccines are , however , aspects which are under_researched and under_reported [ 8 ] . these challenges , if not addressed timely , will severely impact our race to achieve herd_immunity . the `` cold_chain '' acts to preserve biological product quality from the time of manufacture until the point of administration by ensur _ ing that the vaccines are stored and transported within the recommended temperature ranges . vaccines can be categorised by the method by which they were developed , i.e. , the different approaches used , such as ( 1 ) genetic vaccines—using mrna to cause the body to produce viral proteins ; ( 2 ) viral vector vaccines—using genetically_modified viruses such as adenovirus to carry sections of coronavirus genetic material ; ( 3 ) protein vaccines— delivering viral proteins ( but not genetic material ) to induce an immune response ; ( 4 ) whole vaccine—through inactivated or attenuated coronavirus ; and ( 5 ) repur _ posing existing vaccines , e.g. , bcg [ 9 ] . the processes leading to a successful development and administration of the delicate and fragile vaccines are to be conducted meticulously and with care , as it involves extremes of temperature . hence , this makes the management of its cold_chain a subject matter of high priority , and the vac _ cines are to be handled with caution , failing which , the consequences can be detrimental to public health . the aim of this scoping review is to summarise and synthe _ sise the evidence for efficient cold_chain management of page_3 of 14 fahrni et al . journal of pharmaceutical policy_and_practice 2022 , 15 ( 1 ) :16 covid_19 vaccines , and to propose relevant practical recommendations . methods the review was both conducted and reported according to the prisma–scr guidance checklist ( additional file 1 : appendix s1 ) . a review protocol was not registered con _ sidering the short time frame within which the data were retrieved . all review stages were pilot_tested to calibrate reviewers . search strategy two reviewers iai and mlf independently conducted the search using the three electronic databases : litcovid ( pubmed ) , scopus , and sciencedirect , with the aim of retrieving publications related to cold_chain management of covid_19 vaccines . the search was performed using a combination of keywords , mesh terms and free texts , for example , `` covid_19 vaccine '' and “ supply_chain ” and `` refrigeration or temperature_controlled supply_chain or chiller or cold_chain ” . the retrieved citations were exported into endnote version 20 . the full pubmed search strategy is available in additional file 2 : appendix s2 . selection process two reviewers ( mlf and iai ) independently juxtaposed the publications retrieved against the inclusion and exclusion criteria . the inclusion criteria were ( i ) publica _ tions in english and published between april 2020 and january 2022 ; ( ii ) publications which focused on cold_chain operations throughout the vaccine supply_chain ; and ( iii ) publications with accessible full texts . exclusion criteria were ( i ) non_english language documents , ( ii ) publications which focused solely on covid_19 vaccines and their development , and ( iii ) publications discuss _ ing the clinical aspects of the covid_19 vaccine , which were not related to vaccine stability or did not highlight cold_chain management . the reviewers were trained and a pilot with 5 papers was performed to guarantee an inter_reviewer agreement ( until a kappa score of > 0.75 was attained ) . mlf and iai independently performed the screening of titles and abstracts and any discrepan _ cies were resolved via discussion or a third reviewer con _ sulted ( kms ) . data collection and analysis data from each study was charted individually by iai using a standardised and pretested word data collection form and mlf verified the data ( additional file 3 : appen _ dix s3 ) . results were analysed thematically and summarised descriptively in a table and in_text . results search results a total of 6984 publications were retrieved from the three databases searched . after removal of duplicates , non_english texts , and screening of titles and abstracts , the number remaining were one hundred_forty_one ( 141 ) publications . full texts remaining after review was 10 . four full_text publications were retrieved from the refer _ ence lists of relevant publications , resulting in 14 publi _ cations included this review . the flow chart for selection and elimination of publications is shown in fig . 1 . find _ ings from the publications were synthesised and pre _ sented in 3 themes : ( i ) requirements for cold_chain logistics , ( ii ) packing and storage of covid_19 vaccines , and finally ( iii ) transportation and distribution . a con _ ceptual framework emerged linking regulatory require _ ments , optimal logistics operation and formulation stability as the key to effective cold_chain management ( table 1—challenges , c1–12 ) . a descriptive summary was organised by aspects of : ( i ) cold_chain requirements ( process flow , regulatory requirement

) :16 requirements for cold_chain logistics in this section , the regulatory and operational require _ ments for logistics are described . vaccines need to be administered by healthcare pro _ viders in clinics or pharmacies , while many other biolog _ ics for treating chronic conditions , such as diabetes and arthritis , were frequently delivered for self_injection at the patient ’ s home . when arriving at healthcare facilities , covid_19 vaccine immunogenicity and effectiveness are highly dependent on the following factors : vaccines must have been stored in the required cold_chain , the cold_chain must be adequately monitored , and vaccines must be used up within critical timeframes after being removed from the cold_chain or after a puncture in the multidose vial [ 9 , 10 ] . by having appropriately trained managers on cold_chain equipment who are tasked to manage and monitor cold_chain , accidental interruption of the storage temperature conditions and hence vaccine instability can be avoided . consequently , fewer vaccines are rendered ineffective and wasted . [ 10 , 11 ] . cold_chain can be standard ( 2 °c to 8 °c ) or deepfreeze ( as cold as − 70 °c ) . cold_chain requires building exten _ sive infrastructure and is very expensive to maintain . the complexity of the cold_chain is illustrated in documents , such as the cdc vaccine storage and handling toolkit [ 12 ] . effective management of cold_chain logistics for vac _ cines will require precise coordination across processes to ensure that the efficacy of the vaccines is preserved through temperature_monitoring and up_to_date records for traceability [ 7 ] . constraints currently exist in their pro _ duction , multimodal transport , storage , distribution and equal disbursement of vaccines to those needing them . in the european commission ( ec ) _funded chill_on pro _ ject , most of the deviations from high_quality standards of perishable goods ( vaccines included ) occurred during the shipment and transportation process [ 13 ] . where a devia _ tion was detected , it was attributed to a lack of appropriate cold_chain equipment , such as cold_chain boxes , cold_chain trucks and efficient refrigeration system [ 14 ] . in addition , the role of managers who receive vaccines and maintain the relevant cold_chain equipment deserves recognition . they are also responsible for the reconstitution syringes , safety boxes and vaccine diluents ( which does not need to be refrigerated ) delivered . in addition , the manager is tasked to addressing changing cold_storage needs and making additional space should a need arise [ 11 ] . ideally , supply_chain managers will have obtained advance approvals for acquisition of these medical coun _ termeasures—the covid_19 vaccines . in preparedness for subsequent distribution , transport corridors which function as vital routes to end_users are identified ; pri _ mary and secondary transport modes from point of entry to points of distribution are evaluated . in doing so , assessments of the respective governments ’ and non_gov _ ernmental organisations ’ capacity to respond to emer _ gencies , including inspection policies , customs , port , air , rail and road operations , storage , vaccine supply , com _ munications , electricity and fuel generation , supply and distribution will also be weighed in [ 15 ] . understanding each systemic link in the supply_chain , including their strengths and shortfalls , with potential solutions or alter _ natives are essential . in addition , the functional linkages between governments , un agencies , ngos , and private sector entities are all crucial aspects of operations . it is also crucial to understand the extent of business continu _ ity efforts at both regional and national levels at the geo _ graphical location of distribution [ 13 , 16 ] . packing and storage of covid‑19 vaccines here , we present examples of four of the most common vaccines that have special packaging requirements suit _ able for storage and transport throughout the cold_chain , from manufacturer to shipping to warehousing . primary_packaging materials include glass vials and syringes , along with stoppers and seals . packaging for distribu _ tion , includes secondary and tertiary packaging for vac _ cines . secondary packaging assist in reducing volume , cost_saving , minimising logistical burden , and reducing carbon footprint . vaccine storage units at the healthcare facilities site usually consist of purpose_built or pharma _ ceutical_grade ( large or compact ) or household_grade refrigerator or freezer . [ 17 ] . pfizer ’ s mrna vaccine pfizer ’ s mrna vaccine demands the most stringent stor _ age needs . it is required to be stored in a − 70 °c ultra_ cold freezer . packed as a 2 ml , glass preservative_free vial containing 5 doses , the pfizer mrna vaccine are packed for delivery in trays of 195 vials each . five trays of 4,875 doses will be included in each shipment of dimensions 15.7″ l × 15.7″ w × 22″ h and will require to be packed with dry_ice and weigh approximately 34 kg . the vials are subjected to quality measures so no broken vials are present . without opening the outer packaging ( with the exception of inspecting the vial once to see if any is bro _ ken ) , each shipper can be stored for up to 10 days . dry_ice are replenished if the shipper is stored in a warmer climate and/or is opened more frequently than once for inspection of vials . gps_enabled temperature_monitoring devices are placed inside to ensure end_to_end distribu _ tion occurs within the required temperature range . upon arrival of the shipper , the vaccine must be transported into an ultra_cold freezer within 5 min . simultaneously , the gps_enabled logger is disabled and the shipper sent back to the supplier within 10–20 days of arrival . the vac _ cines can be thawed in the refrigerator ( 2–8 °c ) for up to 5 page 10 of 14 fahrni et al . journal of pharmaceutical policy_and_practice 2022 , 15 ( 1 ) :16 days ( 120 h ) , after which it should be discarded . each dose needs to be diluted with normal saline before use and is stable for up to 6 h at room_temperature , after which time it should be discarded . pfizer has incorporated a qr code linked to the emergency use authorisation ( eua ) website , a lot number , and an expiration_date on the label for each vial for documentation purposes [ 9 , 18 ] . pfizer_ biontech recently submitted data to the food and drug administration ( fda ) to update the storage_requirements to a more reasonable temperature ranging anywhere between − 25 and − 15 °c [ 19 ] . moderna ’ s mrna vaccine packed as 10 vials of 10 doses in each carton , the mod _ erna ’ s mrna vaccine will be shipped and delivered at a temperature of −_20_°c . one hundred doses are loaded in a carton of dimensions 5.5″ l × 2.2″ w × 2.5″ h. one advantage these vaccines have is that there are no special requirements for reconstitution or preparation and the vaccines can be stored for up to 30 days in the refrigerator at 2–8 °c until ready for use . at room_temperature post_ thaw , the vaccine is stable for up to 12 h , after which it should be discarded . the vial will have a qr code printed on the label . when the qr code is scanned with a smart device ( i.e. , phone or tablet ) , it will link the device to the eua_specified website . the website will contain product information and provide access to the fact sheets . in addi _ tion , since the expiration_date will not be printed on the vial , there will be a function to search for the date on the website by entering the product lot number . the carton in which the vaccines were shipped will display the same qr code as the label . in addition , the carton will have a 2d barcode printed , which is encoded with the gtin ( prod _ uct id ) , lot number , and an expiration_date that is hard_ coded to 12/31/2069 . [ 9 ] moderna has initiated a trial with a vaccine that may be refrigerator_stable . [ 20 ] . johnson_&_johnson ’ s adenovirus‑vectored vaccine packed as 10 vials per carton and 48 cartons per ship _ per case of dimensions 3.66″ l × 1.5″ w × 2.13″d , the johnson_&_johnson ’ s adenovirus_vectored vaccine will be delivered at a temperature of −_20_°c . each shipper will contain 2,400 doses with five doses in each vial . the j & j vaccine require to be transported to the refrigerator upon arrival . it can be stored for up to 3 months in the refriger _ ator ( 2–8 °c ) . stability information at room_temperature is still forthcoming . [ 9 ] . astrazeneca ( az ) ’ s adenovirus‑vectored vaccine astrazeneca ( az ) ’ s adenovirus_vectored vaccine will be shipped in pallets . each pallet will contain 85 cases packed with 20,400 vials . 10 vials per carton will contain 100 doses . case dimensions are 11.6″ l × 9.3″ w × 7.4″ h. az ’ s vaccine is required to be stored in the refrigera _ tor at 2–8 °c upon arrival . it should be light_protected and can be stored for up to 6 months in the refrigerator ( 2–8 °c ) . to prevent prolonged light exposure , the vac _ cine must be kept in the original packaging until use and is not to be frozen . no reconstitution or special prepa _ ration is required . after the vial is punctured , it can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 6 h , after which the vaccine must be discarded . one advantage is that no reconstitution or special preparation is required for this formulation . [ 9 ] . transportation and distribution in the following section , we present vaccine regulatory and logistic requirements for transportation by air , ocean and ground networks in a pharmaceutical_graded , tem _ perature_controlled supply_chain to healthcare facilities and other points of administration . first and foremost , the vaccine manufacturers will have to comply with the food and drug authority and federal food , drug , and cosmetic act policies . as the vaccines were authorised for use in an event of a public health emergency , the emergency_use_authorization ( eua ) authority will then issue a letter of authorisation that entails two fact sheets prior to the vaccine being trans _ ported to other countries , namely : ( i ) healthcare providers administering vaccine ( vac _ cination providers ) ( ii ) recipients & caregivers [ 21 ] there exists multiple stakeholders in the cold_chain transportation processes , namely , the sender , freight for _ warder , air and road cargo transportation companies , as well as the receiving ground_handling agents [ 22 ] . they operate optimally within a risk management taskforce which is responsible for environmental_health and safety , public and government affairs and policies , communica _ tions , and crucially business continuity , operations and supply_chain management . each stakeholder has a very specific role to play to complete the entire process flow . there is a risk that the operation ceases , should any of the processes fail to run its course , which then jeopardises the business entity . exposed biological products such as vaccines and equally other biological goods to unfavour _ able temperatures can damage the products and eventu _ ally render them being of no use [ 23 ] . the international_air_transport_association ( iata ) and its members are responsible for transporting the vaccine consignments from the nation supplying to the destination airport . several personnel are trained on the technicalities and assist with electricity supply to the refrigerators throughout the flight . once landed , a local road transportation company will provide refrigerated page 11 of 14 fahrni et al . journal of pharmaceutical policy_and_practice 2022 , 15 ( 1 ) :16 trucks to transport vaccines to and from the warehouses and the airport [ 24 ] . the trucker and assistants are then responsible to maintain vaccines within recommended temperature ranges . local government officials provide on_field assistance for customs clearance of vaccines at the airport , and this sometime involves humanitarian organisations which are responsible for distribution to those who need them [ 25 ] . at the healthcare facilities , the capacity of cold_chain equipment will also need to be upgraded ; to cite an example , in ethiopia , only 48 % health facilities had satisfactory cold_chain infrastructure , while 63 % had good cold_chain practices [ 26 ] . in addition , inap _ propriate coordination with local organisations , lack of vaccine monitoring bodies , difficulties in monitoring and controlling vaccine temperature , and financial support for vaccine purchase were identified as the main chal _ lenges in the region of asia [ 27 ] . another area which is also under_researched is the use of vaccines in controlled temperature chain ( ctc ) or outside the cold_chain ( occ ) environments [ 23 ] . one study experimented on commercially available products , such as refrigeration container units , and retrofitted the test units to meet the vaccine storage temperature requirement . experimen _ tal and simulation studies were conducted to assess the technical merits of the solution with the ability to control temperature at − 30 °c or − 70 °c as part of the last mile supply_chain [ 28 ] . in india , an environmentally_friendly , solar photovoltaic powered thermoelectric_based micro cold_storage which can function as a covid_19 vaccine carrier for rural areas , was designed and an experimental study conducted . from the study , last_mile vaccine deliv _ ery was successfully done without any vaccine degrada _ tion [ 29 ] . discussion notably , all the included publications in our scoping review were available in litcovid , an open database of covid_19 literature , which is essentially a curated lit _ erature hub , to track up_to_date scientific information in pubmed . we identified 14 publications originating from usa ( 6 ) , india ( 2 ) , finland , spain , bangladesh , nether _ lands , switzerland and ethiopia . they were reported as reviews ( 4 ) , policy or guidance documents ( 3 ) , experi _ mental studies ( 2 ) , case_reports ( 2 ) , expert commentary ( 1 ) , phenomenological study ( 1 ) and decision_making trial and evaluation laboratory trial ( 1 ) . recommendations for best practice equitable access and public health policy there are justifiable concerns that the requirements for recipient countries to maintain deep_freeze pro _ duction , storage and transportation networks , in par _ ticular for the pfizer vaccines , will limit the capacity of distributors from transporting the vaccine to low_ and middle_income_countries . the success in distributing vaccines to remote areas lies in the mechanisms in place to prevent unavoidable exposure to many stresses such as temperature , light , and agitation that may result in loss of vaccine effectiveness . warm climate regions and poor intercity_connectivity pose obstacles to deliver _ ing the temperature_sensitive biologics to the public . in peru , for example , 30 ultracold freezers existed , but none outside of lima city . these specialised freezers will take 4–6 weeks to produce and cost between $ 10,000 and $ 25,000 . one of the proposed solutions is , therefore , to top off containers with dry_ice every 5 days to keep tem _ peratures stable although this is not a practical solution as dry_ice may be scarce in rural areas , and shipping dry_ice , which sublimates and transforms into carbon diox _ ide gas , is costly and dangerous [ 30 ] . second , since the infrastructure for 2–8 °c is already in place in many com _ munities worldwide , as opposed to ultracold logistics , low_to_middle_income countries may opt for covid_ 19 vaccine candidates requiring the minimal cold_chain requirement . innovation was key—in india , for example , companies that dealt with food chain and had cold stor _ age facilities were compelled to innovate and were sub _ jected to a government directive to do a minor redesign of storage spaces to accommodate such need [ 31 ] . third , advanced cold_chain equipment such as long lasting pas _ sive cold box , medical refrigerators , and refrigerated trucks can facilitate effective storage and transportation system . technologies to assist cold_chain logistics practising data logging does ease the process of monitor _ ing temperatures . however , for this to be done efficiently , ground_handling agents will need to open up the pack _ age or content to monitor conditions that possibly expose the vaccines to extreme temperatures . furthermore , this system allows inspection at the destination , and at that stage , it may become too late for personnel to take any corrective measure . although financial constraints exist , fortunately in today ’ s artificial intelligence era , the emer _ gence of sophisticated internet_of_things ( iots ) , analyt _ ics , mobile and cloud technologies provide the basis for a comprehensive cold_chain feedback mechanism . it allows the reporting of an ad_hoc and routine_base data collection , recording , checking , and analyses of the flow of vaccines from the manufacturing to healthcare facili _ ties . using a vaccine blockchain system and simulated machine_learning technologies , yong et al . presented a method of vaccine traceability effective in preventing vaccine record fraud and thus reducing supply risks . [ 32 ] blockchain facilitates transparency and effectiveness in tracking , tracing and monitoring vaccine delivery . using page 12 of 14 fahrni et al . journal of pharmaceutical policy_and_practice 2022 , 15 ( 1 ) :16 iots , more rigorous temperature monitoring in real time and forecasting can be achieved , although the processing of the generated data is questionable . various aspects of cold_chain generate experimental and numerical data that can train deep and machine_learning models to predict temperature control , although according to schroeder et al. , a reliable method to detect a break in the cold_chain is yet to be validated [ 33 ] . in addition , the use of digital temperature sensors such as thermocouples , resistant temperature detectors , or thermistors can provide accurate data . purpose_built units or pharmaceutical grade units can also be used instead of household or dormitory_style refrigerators or freezers . the use of digital temperature tags has proven beneficial . for example , in india , vaccine manufacturers have begun airlifting vaccines in cold boxes with digi _ tal temperature tags to four major depots in four major states . these were then transported to specified facili _ ties via airplanes or insulated vans after which they were stored in temperature_controlled facilities at the dis _ trict level . vaccines were held in ice_lined refrigerators in districts , then transported to distribution centres in cold boxes , which were then transported to vaccination sites in ice_packed vaccine carriers . simultaneously , the covid vaccine intelligence network , a cloud_based digitalised platform for vaccine distribution management system , monitored the temperature of 29,000 cold_chain points in real_time [ 31 ] . in each vaccine vial , incorporation of a vaccine_vial monitor can provide a clear , visual guide to the vaccine ’ s efficacy throughout the delivery or transport to the point of administration . in addition , the monitor is capable of warning personnel on whether or not the vaccines ’ stabil _ ity had been affected at any stage of distribution before reaching the end_users . this will prevent unnecessary wastage and facilitate vaccination outreach programmes in remote areas , where sophisticated monitoring technol _ ogy is not practical [ 34 ] . improved vaccine formulation as mrna vaccine is considered new technology , there was a lack of guidance on the stability aspects of mrna vaccines during the early phase of the vaccine develop _ ment [ 35 ] . while it is common knowledge that there are a series of analytical_methods used to determine the iden _ tity , purity , potency , safety , and stability of mrna bioac _ tive and mrna–lipid/protein complex formulations , there is still a lack of relevant information on the moni _ toring of quality_attributes and on the proposed storage conditions to ensure stability for mrna vaccines . improvements in the stringent cold_chain storage_requirements can be made by improving vaccine for _ mulation . one approach is to eliminate the cold_chain altogether by making vaccines that can withstand more natural temperatures . another method would be to sta _ bilise vaccines through improved formulation , such as excipient innovation , protein engineering and lyophili _ sation if suitable . for instance , by making biologics such as an mrna vaccine to withstand lyophilisation , its cold_chain requirement might be lessened from deepfreeze to regular cold_chain [ 12 ] . few factors for consideration are selection of excipients ( for example , stabilisers and/ or the inclusion of preservatives ) , formulation milieu ( for instance , ph and tonicifying agents ) , and manufactur _ ing processes ( for example , liquid to lyophilised dosage forms or powdered form ) which can all be made without compromising vaccine potency . the improvised formula _ tion may not require freezing conditions for its long_term_storage . improved understanding of the physicochemi _ cal processes underlying virus potency loss , combined with rational approaches to minimising their occurrence , would be highly beneficial in directing improved vaccine shelf_life , which might eventually result in the abolition of ’ cold_chain ’ requirements . a sustained interest in making vaccines safe at room_temperature has resulted in several promising technolo _ gies—using specific polymers or sugars and optimising the composition of vaccines , certain vaccines can be ren _ dered insensitive to freezing and/or stable for months at room temperatures [ 36 ] . in addition , transforming vac _ cines from liquid ( or frozen liquid or frozen suspension ) to dry powder for reconstitution at the point of admin _ istration can improve vaccine stability . powder engi _ neering technology such as shelf freeze_drying is widely used to transform small_molecule pharmaceuticals , such as vaccines , and other biologics into dry powders while preserving consistency and sterility , which can then be stored for months , if not years , at room_temperature [ 36 ] . this improved formulation of virus_based covid_19 vaccines would result in improved stability profiles ( such as shelf_life extension and conversion from freezer to refrigerator storage ) . furthermore , the number of publi _ cations addressing mechanistic and systemic approaches to formulating and stabilising live attenuated virus and viral vector_based vaccine products is limited , indicat _ ing a critical area for future study . another example is in the modification of its packaging ; for example , for the oral cholera vaccine ( euvichol® ) , packaging them in plastic tubes rather than glass vials , significantly simpli _ fied the manufacturing method , reduced the unit cost , storage , and administration and contributed significantly to the who stockpile increase [ 37 ] . this had improved logistical obstacles , improved patient access and vaccine coverage . similar innovations could also be emulated for covid vaccines . page 13 of 14 fahrni et al . journal of pharmaceutical policy_and_practice 2022 , 15 ( 1 ) :16 limitation of review the lack of primary data on vaccine wastage or impact of a breach in the cold_chain , for instance , has presented limitations in the reporting of the review . waste handling post_vaccination is another major challenge which has not been addressed in this review . disposal of primary_packaging ( vials and syringes ) , secondary packaging ( car _ tons ) , and tertiary packaging ( corrugating boards and cushioning materials ) are valid concerns . indeed , matters pertaining to the disposal of vaccine packaging material , and the disposal of personal_protective_equipment kits are of prime concern . a comprehensive set of guidelines for waste_disposal has not been established , as yet . conclusion vaccines are to be administered to all population in a timely manner . establishing a secure cold_chain manage _ ment of global vaccine chain supply is critical . as a result , innovative technologies and techniques are needed to simplify vaccine distribution , by minimising the need for a cold_chain , reducing packaging footprint , streamlining administration , and reducing waste . potential practices include using renewable energy during production , storage , transportation , and waste treatment processes . in addition , equitable vaccine access can be promoted by using better packaging designs , utilising the internet of things and big_data analytics for monitoring of logistics , as well as , man _ aging real_time databases and coordination platforms to track vaccine deliveries and outreach to the relevant pub _ lic vaccination programmes . finally , covid_19 vaccine storage , dosing , and scheduling could potentially vary over time , and there is , therefore , a need to continually educate and update healthcare providers , especially those who are involved in the vaccination programmes . abbreviations prisma–scr : preferred reporting items for systematic_reviews and meta‑ analyses extension for scoping reviews ; covid_‑19 : coronavirus disease

ribeiro , ariany marques vieira , jovana stojanovic , comfort sanuade , doro yip , simon l bacon summary background synthesising evidence on the long_term vaccine effectiveness of covid_19 vaccines ( bnt162b2 [ pfizer– biontech ] , mrna_1273 [ moderna ] , chadox1_ncov_19 [ azd1222 ; oxford–astrazeneca ] , and ad26.cov2.s [ janssen ] ) against infections , hospitalisations , and mortality is crucial to making evidence_based pandemic policy decisions . methods in this rapid living systematic evidence synthesis and meta_analysis , we searched embase and the us national_institutes_of_health ’ s isearch covid_19 portfolio , supplemented by manual searches of covid_19_specific sources , until dec 1 , 2022 , for studies that reported vaccine effectiveness immediately and at least 112 days after a primary vaccine series or at least 84 days after a booster dose . single reviewers assessed titles , abstracts , and full_text articles , and extracted data , with a second reviewer verifying included studies . the primary outcomes were vaccine effectiveness against sars_cov_2 infections , hospitalisations , and mortality , which were assessed using three_level meta_analytic models . this study is registered with the national collaborating centre for methods and tools , review 473 . findings we screened 16 696 records at the title and abstract level , appraised 832 ( 5·0 % ) full texts , and initially included 73 ( 0·4 % ) studies . of these , we excluded five ( 7 % ) studies because of critical risk of bias , leaving 68 ( 93 % ) studies that were extracted for analysis . for infections caused by any sars_cov_2 strain , vaccine effectiveness for the primary_series reduced from 83 % ( 95 % ci 80–86 ) at baseline ( 14–42 days ) to 62 % ( 53–69 ) by 112–139 days . vaccine effectiveness at baseline was 92 % ( 88–94 ) for hospitalisations and 91 % ( 85–95 ) for mortality , and reduced to 79 % ( 65–87 ) at 224–251 days for hospitalisations and 86 % ( 73–93 ) at 168–195 days for mortality . estimated vaccine effectiveness was lower for the omicron variant for infections , hospitalisations , and mortality at baseline compared with that of other variants , but subsequent reductions occurred at a similar rate across variants . for booster doses , which covered mostly omicron studies , vaccine effectiveness at baseline was 70 % ( 56–80 ) against infections and 89 % ( 82–93 ) against hospitalisations , and reduced to 43 % ( 14–62 ) against infections and 71 % ( 51–83 ) against hospitalisations at 112 days or later . not enough studies were available to report on booster vaccine effectiveness against mortality . interpretation our analyses indicate that vaccine effectiveness generally decreases over time against sars_cov_2 infections , hospitalisations , and mortality . the baseline vaccine effectiveness levels for the omicron variant were notably lower than for other variants . therefore , other preventive measures ( eg , face_mask wearing and physical distancing ) might be necessary to manage the pandemic in the long term . funding canadian institutes of health research and the public health agency of canada . copyright © 2023 published by elsevier ltd. all rights reserved . introduction mass vaccination against sars_cov_2 has been crucial to containing the impact of the covid_19 pandemic.1 however , vaccine_induced antibodies are reduced at 6 months after a primary covid_19 vaccination series ( ie , two doses of a two_dose vaccine or one dose of a one_dose vaccine ) 2 and vaccine effectiveness , a measure of how well vaccines work relative to unvaccinated individuals,3 against infections_and_hospitalisations might also be reduced 2–7 months after receiving a primary vaccination series . this reduction in vaccine effectiveness might be further accentuated by the emergence of new variants of concern . however , studies on the long_term effectiveness of covid_19 vaccines vary in study design , methodology , and quality , and have generated diverse findings , which makes it challenging for policy makers to make evidence_based decisions , such as the timing of administering covid_19 vaccine booster doses . to our knowledge , only one similar systematic_review exists to date that offers meta_analytical evidence on the duration of covid_19 vaccine effectiveness . 4 this review , published in march , 2022 , found a rapid reduction in protection against infections , but not against severe_disease . however , the review only examined the vaccine articles440 www.thelancet.com/respiratory_vol 11 may 2023effectiveness of primary vaccine series and did not report synthesised data on covid_19_related mortality nor the omicron ( b.1.1.529 ) variant . given the continued evolution of the pandemic , notably the spread of the omicron variant , updated information can be invaluable to inform policy makers . as part of ongoing canadian monitoring , this rapid living systematic evidence synthesis sought to provide information on long_term vaccine effectiveness for canadian_licensed covid_19 vaccines ( ie , bnt162b2 [ pfizer–biontech ] , mrna_1273 [ moderna ] , chadox1_ncov_19 [ azd1222 ; oxford–astrazeneca , and ad26.cov2.s [ janssen ] ) for adults . 5 we aimed to investigate ( 1 ) how the vaccine effectiveness of a primary_series of covid_19 vaccines against sars_cov_2 infections , hospitalisations , and mortality changes from shortly after completing vaccination to 112 days or more after vaccination ; ( 2 ) how the vaccine effectiveness of a primary_series plus a single booster dose against sars_cov_2 infections , hospitalisations , and mortality changes from shortly after vaccination to 84 days or more after vaccination ; and ( 3 ) what the vaccine effectiveness patterns are for infections , hospitalisations , and mortality against the omicron variant . methods search strategy and selection criteria we used rapid systematic_review methods for this living evidence synthesis . we initially searched for studies published until sept 10 , 2021 , and updated the search on nov 19 , 2021 . from feb 25 , 2022 , we updated the synthesis every 4 weeks . the results reported here are from the 13th synthesis round ( until dec 1 , 2022 ) . results from previous rounds and forthcoming updates can be accessed online at our project page . the protocol was registered with the national collaborating centre for methods and tools and is available on our project page . this report adheres to the prisma 2020 guidelines . 6 since the publication of the protocol , the review has been converted from a standalone review to a living review , following a request from the public health agency of canada . additionally , we have adapted the review to account for changes in the pandemic and its management , most notably , by including studies with booster data and variant_specific information ( ie , for delta [ b.1.617 .2 ] and omicron ) . further , we adapted the infection outcome to combine symptomatic and asymptomatic data . when multiple infection outcomes were reported only one per study was included ( ie , data on all infections was the priority , then symptomatic infections , then asymptomatic infections ) . we searched the us national_institutes_of_health ’ s ( nih ) isearch covid_19 portfolio 7 and embase via ovid until dec 1 , 2022 . the search strategy was tailored to each database ( appendix p 7 ) . additionally , we manually searched covid_19_specific sources , including the us department of veterans_affairs ’ evidence synthesis program 8,9 and by searching the reference lists of previous systematic reviews.research in context evidence before this study mass vaccination against the sars_cov_2 virus has been crucial to containing the impact of the covid_19 pandemic . immunogenicity research indicates that the effectiveness of vaccines might decline over time ; although , it is not clear how this reduction translates to clinical vaccine effectiveness . to our knowledge , one key systematic_review to date has extensively examined the duration of covid_19 vaccine effectiveness for infections_and_hospitalisations . this review found that vaccine effectiveness decreased over time in response to a primary vaccine series . however , the authors did not report any data related to booster doses , covid_19_related mortality , nor the omicron ( b.1.1.529 ) variant—key omissions given the ongoing pandemic situation . between jan 1 , 2020 , and dec 1 , 2022 , we searched embase and the us national_institutes_of_health ’ s isearch covid_19 portfolio , a comprehensive , expert_curated database covering eight publication and preprint databases , and manually searched covid_19_specific sources for our living systematic evidence synthesis and meta_analysis . we included studies in english or french that reported vaccine effectiveness for sars_cov_2 infections , hospitalisations , and mortality in response to either a primary_series or a booster dose of covid_19 vaccine at baseline and in the long_term ( ≥112 days for the primary_series or ≥84 days for the booster dose ) . the search strategy included key terms related to vaccination ( eg , vaccine types and producers ) . added value of this study using three_level meta_analytic models , we found marked decreases over time in vaccine effectiveness for sars_cov_2 infections for both the primary_series and booster , and a smaller decrease for hospitalisations and mortality . the findings for the omicron variant were similar , but had notably lower levels of vaccine effectiveness at baseline . these findings extend the previous data by showing a lower initial vaccine effectiveness response to the omicron variant with further reductions over time . implications of all the available evidence vaccination continues to be an effective measure over time to reduce covid_19 hospitalisations and mortality , but less so for infections . other measures ( eg , face masks and physical distancing ) might be necessary to control infections in the long term . our findings provide insights for clinicians , public health_care policy makers , and researchers about the long_term vaccine effectiveness of covid_19 vaccines , which can inform clinical and policy recommendations , such as the timing of future booster doses . for the covid_end project see https : //osf.io/dp9kq/ for the protocol see https : //www.nccmt.ca/covid_19/ covid_19_evidence_reviews/473 see online for appendix for

studies were eligible if they reported vaccine effectiveness data on adults ( aged_≥18 years ) or on a predominately adult general population . vaccine effectiveness data needed to explicitly compare participants who were fully_vaccinated with unvaccinated participants . to assess the vaccine effectiveness of the primary_series , fully_vaccinated participants needed to have received two doses of bnt162b2 , mrna_1273 , or chadox1/azd1222 , or one dose of ad26.cov2.s . for booster vaccine effectiveness , fully_vaccinated participants needed to have received a full primary_series and an additional dose of a canadian_licensed covid_19 vaccine . studies of the vaccine effectiveness of primary_series needed vaccine effectiveness data both at baseline ( 0–42 days after primary_series ) and follow_up ( ≥112 days after primary_series ) . booster_dose studies also needed baseline ( 0–28 days after a booster dose ) and follow_up ( ≥84 days_post booster ) vaccine effectiveness data . baselines covered the periods when vaccine effectiveness was optimal , hence the difference between primary and booster doses . all data needed to be directly extractable from the paper ( eg , studies with vaccine effectiveness that was reported non_numerically as figures were excluded ) . lastly , we included studies that reported original findings in english or french . the screening was done by a small team of coders ( 4–6 reviewers per review round ) who were included after a training–testing phase . two stages of screening ( title and abstract then full text ) were done using rayyan ( rayyan systems , cambridge , ma , usa ) , with one reviewer assigned to each record per stage . included studies were verified by a second reviewer , with cases of uncertainty resolved in consultation with a third reviewer . as this study is based on the extant literature , we did not require ethics approval . data extraction we extracted vaccine effectiveness data for sars_cov_2 infections , hospitalisations , and mortality . data were extracted for each study by a single reviewer and verified by a second reviewer . disagreements were resolved by discussion . when vaccine effectiveness results were available both for an entire sample and for subgroups ( eg , according to age ) , we only extracted data for the larger grouping ( ie , the full sample ) ; otherwise , we treated subgroups as separate samples . when multiple versions of confounder_adjusted vaccine effectiveness were reported , we extracted the model considered to have the lowest risk of bias . data were extracted into a study_specific spreadsheet . we operationalised infection data as including either symptomatic or asymptomatic infections , prioritising the extraction of data combining symptomatic and asymptomatic infections over symptomatic_specific or asymptomatic_specific data , and data on symptomatic over asymptomatic infections . we also extracted descriptive characteristics of the studies ( eg , publication year , author , title , country , format , and study design ) and the sample characteristics , the vaccine schedule used , timing of the outcome assessments converted to days since vaccination , and information on potential stratification factors . adequate vaccine effectiveness response who have created a definition for adequate covid_19 vaccine effectiveness , 3 in which the vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infections should be at least 70 % with a lower 95 % ci of at least 50 % , and the vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisations or mortality should be at least 90 % with a lower 95 % ci of at least 70 % . in this systematic_review , we assessed results in terms of statistically significant reductions in vaccine effectiveness from baseline and meeting these who criteria . quality assessment to assess risk of bias , we used a version of the risk of bias in non_randomized studies of interventions tool adapted to covid_19 , 10,11 which assesses seven domains of bias . the tool classified risk of bias for each study as low , moderate , serious , or critical . a single reviewer ( sb ) did the risk of bias assessment , verified by a second reviewer , and validated assessments against ratings from the team that developed the tool . 10 studies that were rated as having a critical risk of bias were excluded from analyses . data analysis the primary outcomes were the effectiveness of covid_19 vaccines against sars_cov_2 infections , hospitalisations , and mortality at various time periods since receipt of primary and booster vaccinations . analyses reported here include all vaccines . additional analyses on vaccine class and individual vaccines are reported in the appendix ( p 44 ) . we recorded no secondary outcomes . we converted all extracted vaccine effectiveness estimates into log risk ratios for analyses and transformed results into percentage vaccine effectiveness for presentation . 12 when extracted vaccine effectiveness values were not readily usable for computation , values were adjusted ( eg , correcting for errors or adjusting values that would imply a risk ratio of 0 ; appendix p 13 ) . we pooled vaccine effectiveness estimates using three_ level meta_analytic models via the rma.mv function of the metafor ( version 3.0.2 ) 13 package in r ( version 4.1.2 ) . three_level meta_analyses allow for the explicit modelling of nested structures in data ( eg , when studies provide multiple estimates each , such as for different subgroups , or timepoints ) , and produce more valid and reliable estimates than traditional ( univariate ) fixed and random effects models under such circumstances . 14–16 given our interest in vaccine effectiveness waning over time , we deemed the use of three_level models ideal for this purpose ( because each study provided vaccine effectiveness data for multiple timepoints ) . articles442 www.thelancet.com/respiratory_vol 11 may 2023country vaccines

may 2023 443we specified models according to published guidelines for three_level models,17 using a restricted maximum_ likelihood procedure to estimate variance components . extracted vaccine effectiveness estimates were nested within studies , allowing for the estimation of random intercept components . our procedure allowed us to account for within_study heterogeneity ( ie , differences in vaccine effectiveness estimates between subgroups or timepoints within studies , designated as level 2 ) , and between_study heterogeneity ( differences in vaccine effectiveness estimates produced between studies , designated as level 3 ) . to examine waning over time , we computed model_predicted vaccine effectiveness for each timepoint , and did formal moderation tests on the difference in vaccine effectiveness value at each follow_up period compared with the baseline vaccine effectiveness values . importantly , for any given set of analyses , all timepoints were modelled simultaneously in the model ( and time was specified as a moderator variable ) . following recommendations to improve the reliability of meta_analytic inferences , 12 we only report estimates for a given timepoint when at least four studies provided data to pool meta_analytically at that timepoint . however , for comprehensiveness , the results for timepoints examined by fewer than four studies are reported in

adequate protection at baseline , reaching 83 % ( 95 % ci 80–86 ; table 2 ) . however , all follow_up periods after 112 days after vaccination showed a statistical reduction in vaccine effectiveness , none of which reached adequate protection levels ( table 2 ; figure 1 ) . we found adequate levels of baseline vaccine effectiveness for hospitalisations ( 92 % [ 88–94 ] ) from pooled data for 25 ( 52 % ) studies and for mortality ( 91 % [ 85–95 ] ) from pooled data for ten ( 21 % ) studies ( table 2 , figure 1 ) . we found small but statistically significant decreases in vaccine effectiveness over time : vaccine effectiveness reduced to 79 % [ 65–87 ] for hospitalisations by 224–51 days and 86 % [ 73–93 ] for mortality by 168–95 days ( table 2 ) , both below who adequate levels . we pooled 14 ( 29 % ) studies for vaccine effectiveness against infections and eight ( 17 % ) studies for vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisations in response to the omicron variant , but we had too few studies to pool on mortality ( κ =1 ) . estimates of baseline vaccine effectiveness against omicron were not considered adequate for neither infections ( 61 % [ 51–68 ] ) nor hospitalisations ( 71 % [ 58–80 ] ; table 2 ) .the patterns of vaccine effectiveness change were similar for those against the omicron variant compared with the general data on any variant—ie , we found large reductions in vaccine effectiveness for infections but small reductions for hospitalisations ( table 2 ) . analyses broken down by vaccine type ( ie , mrna vaccines [ bnt162b2 or mrna_1273 ] and adenovirus vaccines [ chadox1/azd1222 or ad26.cov2.s ] ) , showed similar patterns as already described ; although , the baseline data for adenovirus vaccines did not meet adequate levels for hospitalisations and mortality ( table 3 ) . results for individual vaccine brands can be found in the appendix ( p 35 ) . the pooled infection data from 13 ( 19 % ) booster_dose studies show that the baseline vaccine effectiveness did not meet adequate levels ( 70 % [ 95 % ci 56–80 ] ) and significantly decreased over time ( table 4 , figure 2 ) . we pooled seven ( 62 % ) studies for hospitalisation data , with a marginally inadequate baseline response ( 89 % [ 82–93 ] ) , followed by further reductions over time ( table 4 , figure 2 ) . we had too few studies to report on booster vaccine effectiveness against mortality ( κ=3 ) . findings for the vaccine effectiveness of covid_19 booster doses against the omicron variant were largely identical to data for any variant ( table 4 ) ; however , this finding was because most of our data for booster vaccine effectiveness were limited to mrna vaccines against omicron . our analyses found very high levels of heterogeneity , as indicated by the i² and σ estimates , and the 95 % prediction intervals ( tables 2–4 ) . such heterogeneity can undermine our confidence in generalising from the estimates , even those with relatively narrow cis . for instance , our point estimate for the vaccine effectiveness of primary_series against infections ( for any vaccine and any variant ) was high at baseline ( 83 % at 14–42 days ) with a narrow 95 % ci ( 80–86 ) . this finding indicates high confidence that on average studies converge on this point estimate . however , the 95 % prediction_interval ranged was 38–95 , indicating that predicting the results of any given new study would be difficult ( eg , predicting vaccine effectiveness in a new context , such as in a country not yet represented in the data ) . overall , risk of bias was serious for most studies , which was based on the lack of adjustments for important covid_19 prognostic factors . three ( 4 % ) studies had a low overall risk of bias , 13 ( 19 % ) studies had moderate risk , and 52 ( 76 % ) studies had serious risk . because of our small sample_size , analyses of publication_bias were limited to the vaccine effectiveness of primary_series for infections_and_hospitalisations ( appendix p 45 ) . although preprint and published studies both showed similar reductions in vaccine effectiveness over time ( for both outcome variables ) , we found a significant effect of publication type for infections such figure 1 : vaccine effectiveness of primary_series ( a ) vaccine effectiveness of primary_series against sars_cov_2 infections , by variant ( κ=48 ) . ( b ) vaccine effectiveness of primary_series against covid_19_related hospitalisations ( κ=25 ) and deaths ( κ =10 ) . the main data points with error bars represent meta_analytical estimates of vaccine effectiveness with corresponding 95 % cis . the lighter points scattered around each meta_analytical estimate represent estimates of vaccine effectiveness as extracted from individual studies . the horizontal solid grey lines represent the 90 % point estimate and dotted lines represent 70 % ci protection levels , as stipulated by who.a 0–13 14–42 112–139 140–167 168–195 196–223 224–251 252–279 280–307 days since completion of primary_series–5075 50 0 –2525100vaccine eﬀectiveness ( % ) variant : any variant omicron ( b.1.1.529 ) variant b –5075 50 0 –2525100vaccine eﬀectiveness ( % ) outcome : hospitalisationsdeaths articles446 www.thelancet.com/respiratory_vol 11 may 2023that vaccine effectiveness at baseline began at a significantly lower level for preprint studies ( 72 % vs 84 % at 14_42 days , reflecting a log odds_ratio [ or ] of 0·57 [ 95 % ci 0·05–1·09 ] ; p=0·031 ) . we found no statistical differences between published and preprint studies in estimates of vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisations ( appendix p_47 ) . funnel plots also showed some skewness , indicating potential publication_bias in this literature ( appendix p 48 ) . we did two sets of moderation analyses to examine the robustness of our models . the first set of analyses examined the degree to which vaccine effectiveness estimates against infections ( for which we had the most data ) differed across studies of different design types . we found little evidence that our results would differ if limited to either case_control or cohort_based studies ( and the effect of trials on our results is mostly negligible due to their rarity ;

although , vaccine effectiveness remained high over time ( > 75 % ) . when looking at omicron_only data , we found similar waning patterns , except that baseline levels of vaccine effectiveness did not reach adequate levels for infections or hospitalisations . what might be driving these omicron patterns is unclear—eg , whether a degradation in immunogenicity , changes in public health measures , variations in case numbers and general transmission , or a combination of all these . although boosters might be promising at re_establishing some protection , our results found that the vaccine effectiveness of boosters at baseline ( 7–28 days after receiving the booster ) were still , albeit by a small margin , below the who ’ s recommended levels and in the long term , these numbers reduced further . our booster_dose estimates predominately represent mrna vaccines against omicron , which reflects the situation in many countries . collectively , these data suggest that vaccines are providing reasonably stable protection against hospitalisations and mortality over the long term , but that protection against infections is more modest.when considering different classes of vaccines for the primary_series , patterns of the change in vaccine effectiveness over time were consistent , but vaccine effectiveness for adenovirus ( vs mrna ) vaccines against infections was lower overall . by contrast , both vaccine classes were similar in terms of hospitalisations and mortality . however , we included fewer studies on adenovirus vaccines and few studies that directly compared mrna with adenovirus vaccines . 92 thus , asserting that any difference exists between the two classes is difficult . given the marginally adequate baseline vaccine effectiveness against the omicron variant and declining vaccine effectiveness over time , other covid_19 mitigation measures ( eg , the use of face masks , physical distancing , and quarantining ) might continue to be needed to reduce covid_19 spread and reduce covid_19_related hospitalisations and deaths . 93 growing evidence supports the utility of these measures in the management of covid_19 ; 94–96 however , most of this evidence has not taken vaccination status into account . therefore , future research must study the effectiveness of these measures on vaccinated individuals . generally , our vaccine effectiveness findings are consistent with data on immunogenicity showing that the strong immunological response initially elicited by vaccination appears to reduce over time . 97,98 although baseline , days follow_up , days i² σ 0–13 14–42 112–139 140–167 168–195 196–223 224–251 252–279 280–307 ( continued from previous page ) any adenovirus vaccine any variant documented infections·· 69 % ( 95 % ci 60 to 75 ;

inactivated virus vaccines . we used a hierarchy when including infection data , meaning that we reviewed a mixture of symptomatic and asymptomatic data within the reported infection results ; although , within any specific study all reported data over time were for the same outcome . previous research has suggested that vaccine effectiveness of covid_19 vaccines for symptomatic infections might be higher than for asymptomatic infections ; 101 although , little work has been done to examine how reductions in vaccine effectiveness operate differentially between the two outcomes . therefore , our absolute point estimates of vaccine effectiveness might be difficult to compare with those of studies that included only symptomatic or asymptomatic infections ; however , reductions in vaccine effectiveness are not likely to only affect one type of infection and not the other . there is also ongoing debate about the effect of hybrid immunity , with factors such as the particular variant concerned , number of vaccines received , and the timing of vaccination all potentially playing a role . 102 we did not explore this issue directly ; although , most included studies either excluded or statistically adjusted for previous recent infection , meaning that the results generally do not reflect hybrid immunity . data are scarce on the longer_term effects of hybrid immunity . however , data from one study by carazo and colleagues 37 suggested that , when compared with unvaccinated and uninfected individuals , there was little difference over time in the vaccine effectiveness of omicron_based reinfection between one dose and two doses of vaccines in individuals who were previously_infected ( ie , hybrid immunity ) . by contrast , we found that a benefit might exist in those with three doses ( although we had only one follow_up data point in this group ) . given the greater infection prevalence of the omicron variant compared with that of previous variants , future reviews should be able to explore the issue of hybrid immunity in greater depth as more data become available . we also note that the literature itself has limitations that can not be overcome through a systematic_review alone . for instance , our supplemental analyses showed that published studies , and studies with smaller samples sizes , might produce higher baseline estimates of vaccine effectiveness than those of unpublished and larger studies . future studies , beyond trials , might benefit from regularly registering their intended procedures and using other open_science practices to improve monitoring of bias . another limitation of the literature is that we were only able to identify three studies that we qualified as having low risk of bias . two were randomised controlled trials done early in the covid_19 pandemic ( with data extending up to march , 2021 ) that found promising results of vaccine effectiveness against infection . 89 , 52 the third was a more recent test_negative study from canada that found good vaccine effectiveness against delta infections but very poor vaccine effectiveness against omicron infections across timepoints . 34 clearly , high_quality studies on vaccine effectiveness waning are needed , particularly against hospitalisations and mortality . last , we would like to emphasise that our review found a large degree of heterogeneity in the literature . this finding is not a limitation of our review , as documenting such heterogeneity is a valuable contribution and might reflect complex interactions between vaccination and contextual factors as they operate in the world . however , such heterogeneity does introduce challenges in predicting whether vaccination will be truly effective under a given regimen , or for a given population . this heterogeneity indicates that future studies and reviews should examine factors that predict when , where , and for whom the vaccines show differential effectiveness to address possible disparities in protection . in so doing , examining how vaccines interact with other protective measures ( eg , face_mask wearing and isolation policies ) might be particularly informative . our evidence synthesis also has additional strengths . first , we used broad search terms and a high_quality rapid review methodology , including the training of reviewers and validation of included studies and extracted data . second , we used advanced three_level meta_analytic models to examine whether vaccine effectiveness at follow_up differed from that at baseline , taking into account both within_study and between_study variability , a technique which affords us more robust and reliable conclusions than would be available with traditional fixed and random effects models . third , this living systematic evidence synthesis provides important updates compared with previous systematic_reviews , 4,103 notably longer follow_ up periods and data on the omicron variant and mortality . our findings provide insights for clinicians , public health_care policy makers , and researchers about the long_term vaccine effectiveness of covid_19 vaccines , which can inform clinical and policy recommendations . our analyses indicate that vaccine effectiveness reduces over time for both primary_series and booster doses for preventing sars_cov_2 infections , hospitalisations , and mortality , a finding which is most pronounced for infections . furthermore , we found similar reductions with the omicron variant , except that baseline levels of vaccine effectiveness were noticeably lower and did not meet the who criteria for an adequate vaccine response . given that omicron has become the dominant variant , maintaining covid_19 prevention behaviours might be needed ( eg , face_mask wearing and physical distancing ) in addition to vaccination to reduce the transmission of the virus and limit increases in infections . however , additional studies are needed to investigate the effectiveness of using multiple transmission prevention strategies simultaneously ( eg , combining vaccination and face_mask wearing ) . contributors slb , nw , and kj_d had full

this represents a major limitation for the rapid distribution of the vaccines [ 1,2 ] . however , no information is currently available about the consequences of movement to the integrity of the reconstituted vaccines . we have now analysed the integrity of the pﬁzerebiontech and moderna vaccines under different movement conditions , and we provide novel information crucial to improving the distribution of the vaccines to the target population . materials and methods the hospital del mar ( barcelona , spain ) acted as a reference hospital and the pharmacy department as vaccine distributor . several vials and syringes of p ﬁzerebiontech and moderna covid_ 19 vaccines were returned to the pharmacy department by thevaccination teams after exceeding the expiration time or for po_ tential microbiological contamination , such as vials falling to the ground . for this analysis we selected only the vials and syringes with loss of guarantee of lack of microbiological contamination . syringes of reconstituted p ﬁzerebiontech or moderna covid_19 vaccines ( 0.5 e2 ml ) were prepared in a laminar ﬂow chamber to be subjected to a stability analysis to evaluate the impact of movement conditions on mrna integrity . for this purpose , samples were exposed for 180 min at room_temperature ( 21 ±1/c14c , 55±10 % humidity ) under different condi_ tions . a ﬁrst group ( n¼12 from p ﬁzerebiontech and n¼17 from moderna ) remained without movement during 180 min to mimic the manufacturer 's vaccine conditions for use after reconstitution . a second group ( n¼10 from p ﬁzerebiontech and n¼16 from moderna ) was exposed to continuous movement during 180 min in fig . 1 . analysis of the integrity of mrna in reconstituted p ﬁzerebiontech coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid_19 ) vaccines .

were similar in these three experimental groups with very low fu values ( figs . 1a and 2 a ) corresponding to < 5 % of the original mrna degradation for both p ﬁzerebiontech and moderna samples ( figs . 1b and 2 b ) . any possible product of the original mrna degradation should be identi ﬁed in these lower_molecular_weight fractions [ 4 ] . by contrast , the integrity of the mrna in p ﬁzerebiontech and moderna samples exposed to vortex shaking was signi_ﬁcantly impaired . indeed , the rna fractions area under the original mrna peak was 1.34 ±0.31 fu ( p < 0.001 ) for the p ﬁzerebiontech samples ( fig . 1 a ) : 9.87 ±2.36 % of original mrna degradation ( p < 0.01 ) ( fig . 1 b ) . rna fractions area under the original mrna peak of the moderna samples after vortex was 5.03 ±1.16 fu ( p < 0.001 ) ( fig . 2 a ) , corresponding to only 2.95 ±0.45 % of mrna degradation ( not signi_ﬁcant ) ( fig . 2 b ) due to the higher rna fraction of the peak of non_degraded mrna in the moderna ( 147.26 ±17.80 fu ) than in the p ﬁzerebiontech ( 10.92 ±1.00 fu ) samples . discussion a continued moderate movement at room_temperature during 180 min of the reconstituted p ﬁzerebiontech and moderna vaccines does not impair the quality of the mrna since this quality was similar without movement and did not differ from the original quality of the fresh samples . as expected , the mrna in these reconstituted vaccines may be degraded under conditions reported to impair mrna integrity [ 3 ] , although the degradation after this massive shaking was only moderate , mainly with the moderna vaccine . therefore , exposure of the p ﬁzerebiontech and moderna covid_19 reconstituted vaccines to continuous movement mimicking ground transportation during 180 min at room temper_ ature does not impair mrna quality . such a period of 180 min could guarantee ground transportation over 180 e300 km in road condi_ tions of europe and north_america . this distance would ensure the distribution of the vaccine after reconstitution to the institutions that do not have the appropriate facilities to do it . the permanence of the mrna 's integrity under these experimental conditions suggests that the p ﬁzerebiontech and moderna reconstituted vaccines , subse_ quently fractionated in syringes in pharmacy departments , could be more easily distributed than initially expected . some limitations of this study must be addressed . the total_number of moderna and p ﬁzerebiontech samples available was small , since few samples were returned to the pharmacy depart_ ment due to potential loss of microbiological traceability . this scarcity leads to a discrepant number of samples for the various arms to prioritize the groups with a lower range of changes induced by the independent variable ( fresh , 180 min steady , and swing ) to optimize the detection of any possible modi ﬁcation due to this variable . furthermore , no information is currently available about the possible direct consequences of rna stability variation on alteration of vaccine ef_ﬁcacy . however , prevention of the degra_ dation of the active component of the medication , the mrna in these vaccines , represents a mandatory requirement.in conclusion , the stability of p ﬁzerebiontech and moderna reconstituted vaccines after continuous movement at room_temperature may improve the ef ﬁciency in the administration of the vaccines , which may lead to shorter and more homogeneous vaccination in cities and rural areas . the possibility of preserving the mrna after medium_distance ground transportation of reconstituted and fractionated syringes of both vaccines may optimize the distribution . author contributions all the authors contributed to the acquisition , analysis , and

for instance , the strict handling instruc_tions which were specified as part of the conditions of authorisation resulted in the need to recruit more healthcare professionals ( or trained healthcare students ) to help with the dilution , drawing up and administration of the vaccine . this has also caused a degree of uncertainty about the potential adverse consequences of accidental mishandling of the vaccine . pfizer ’ s guidelines currently state that the vaccine vials should only be inverted strengths and limitations of this study ►this translational study answers key questions raised in covid_19 vaccination centres regarding the stability of the pfizer_ biont ech covid_19 vac__cine on handling , to inform decision_ making process should accidental mishandling or non_ conformity occur . ►the close collaboration between healthcare profes_ sionals in vaccination centres and scientists at the university of brighton allowed for timely access to residual vaccine , accurate data collection and test_ing of handling conditions highly relevant to clinical practice . ►the validity of the results was confirmed through re _ peated testing on at least three separate occasions . ►since vaccine vials were prioritised solely for vac _ cination use during the peak of the pandemic , tests were performed on small samples aliquoted into plastic tubes ( up to 0.3 ml , equivalent to one vac__cine dose ) taken from residual vaccine in used but appropriately handled bottles , rather than full six_ dose glass vials . ►the detected instability upon mishandling indicates a reduction in the vaccine ’ s efficacy ; however , clin_ical activity was not directly measured in this study.by copyright . on january 10 , 2022 by exeter team . protected http : //openscience.bmj.com/ bmj open_science : first published as 10.1136/bmjos_2021_100203 on 13 september 2021 . downloaded from 2 kudsiova l , et al . bmj open_science 2021 ;

by gentle inversion ( the current recommended practice ) , flicking or shaking at moderate speed by moving up and down 10 times ( similar to shaking applied when reconstituting injections ) , shaking vigorously ( similar to shaking an oral suspen_sion ) , or subject to vibration by vortexing on a vortex mixer ( fisher scientific , uk ) set at a maximum speed for 10 s ; ( 2 ) samples were knocked over on a bench or dropped from various heights ( 10 , 30 or 130 cm ) onto a bench or laminate flooring ; and ( 3 ) samples were drawn and injected through a 23 g needle up to five times , at different speeds ( up to 300 µl/s ) . controls were used in ever y experiment and were left untreated . dynamic light scatteringapproximately ~45 µl from each of the above handled samples were transferred to disposable low volume ( 45 µl ) polystyrene clear cuvettes ( purchased from malvern panalytical , w orcestershire , uk ) without further dilu_ tion , and the apparent hydrodynamic size of the vaccine formulation was measured by dynamic_light_scattering at 25°c using a zetasizer nano zs ( malvern panalytical ) as described previously . 5 6 three repeat measurements ( of 13–17 runs each ) were performed for each sample . results were statistically analysed by analysis of variance ( anova ) followed by a dunnett post_ test . gel electrophoresisagarose gel_electrophoresis was per formed to visualise mrna . migration of the mrna band can reveal the type of instability that the various handling conditions might inflict on the mrna within the lipid formulation . ten microlitres from each of the above samples was trans_ferred into separate dnase/rnase_ free eppendor f tubes without further dilution , and 2 µl of gel loading buffer ( containing 0.25 % w/v bromophenol blue and 40 % w/v sucrose , purchased from merck chemicals ) was added to each sample . a_10 µl volume of the final reconstituted vaccine was estimated to contain ~1 µg of encapsulated by copyright . on january 10 , 2022 by exeter team . protected http : //openscience.bmj.com/ bmj open_science : first published as 10.1136/bmjos_2021_100203 on 13 september 2021 . downloaded from 3 kudsiova l , et al . bmj open_science 2021 ;

anova , dunnett post_ test ) in vigorously shaken and vortexed samples . the poly_dispersity index also increased significantly ( p < 0.01 ) in samples that were moderately shaken , vigorously shaken and vortexed . it should be noted that despite only a slight increase in the average particle size , for example , a 6.1 nm increase in the case of the moder _ ately shaken sample compared to the control , the coin_ciding increase in polydispersity index ( from 0.202 to 0.255 ) indicated the presence of a small number of much larger particles , the presence of which increased the average population size . this was evident from the intensity size distribution plots ( shown in figure 1c , d ) , which showed a reduction in the intensity of the main size peak and either the appearance of another larger size distribution peak or a widening in the distribution of the main peak towards the larger particle size range , as opposed to the lower size range , suggesting that the polydispersity index increase was due to the presence of larger and not smaller particles . in the case of the moderately shaken sample ( orange line in figure 1d ) , the larger_ sized population peaked at around 1000 nm , suggesting the presence of a small number of very large particles . in the case of the vigorously shaken and vortexed samples , larger second peaks or broadening and shifting of the original size peak suggested the pres_ence of an even higher proportion of larger particles , indicating a higher degree of aggregation . gel_electrophoresis ( figure 1b ) shows the migration of free ( unencapsulated ) mrna down the gel and the posi_tion of the band reflects its molecular weight . in compar _ ison to a reference rna ladder , the size of the vaccine ’ s mrna appears to be between 3000 and 5000 bases long , which matches the expected size of the modified spike mrna protein in the bnt162b2 vaccine , reported to be 4284 bases long . 8 the samples tested ( which were the same as those used for size measurement ) showed a corresponding increase in the mrna band intensity with increasing levels of shaking and vortexing , suggesting that more free mrna has been released from the lipid formulation and was available to travel down the gel . the increased gel band intensity highly correlated with the increase in particle size ( r 2 value was measured to be 0.9954 ) , suggesting that the observed aggregation was related to the mrna release from the lipid nanoparticle formulation . it should be noted , however , that no degra_dation or breakdown of the size of the mrna was observed due to the absence of any smaller molecular weight bands or smears underneath the main mrna band in the tested samples . this is thought to be attributed to modifications made to the mrna , to improve its stability to enzymatic degradation . 8 in order to get an idea of the approximate amount of mrna separation , vaccine samples were treated with 0.1 % v/v t riton x_100 to release the encapsulated mrna . band intensity analysis using imagej ( which provides an approximate semi_ quantitative estimate of band bright _ ness ) is shown in the table within figure 1b , suggesting that the amount of mrna release due to triton x_100 was around 8.2_ fold higher compared with control ( which equated to ~12.2 % of mrna release from the control relative to that released using triton x_100 ) . this also equated to ~2.9_ fold and 4.1_ fold increases in mrna release in the vigorously shaken and vortexed samples , respectively , when compared with the control . this was also estimated to be ~35 % and~50 % of the overall mrna dose , respectively . effect of dropping from various heightsvaccine samples were knocked over on a bench or dropped from various heights to mimic accidental drop_ping during transportation , dilution or administration . size measurement results ( figure 2a ) showed no signif_ icant difference in the actual size or the polydispersity index when compared with the control . however , a slight increase in size was observed in all samples , which was highest in the sample dropped from a 130 cm height ( an average increase of 3.1 nm ) mirrored by a slight increase in polydispersity index , suggesting minor aggregation . the size intensity distribution of the samples was also comparable to that of the control ( data not shown ) . the release of mrna from the lipid formulation was also similar to that of the control , as shown from gel elec_trophoresis results in figure 2b . some fluorescence was detected just underneath the well , which could be due to partial mrna release from the complex that was not fully released to travel down the gel , but remained loosely associated with the lipid nanoparticles . this was mostly evident in samples dropped from a 30 cm height . it should be noted that 60 µl sample volumes were used in the experiments used for figures 1 and 2 ; however , larger samples of 300 µl were also tested in selected samples and showed ver y similar results ( online supple_ mental figure s1 in online data repository ) . effect of repeated drawing and injection through a 23 g needle at different speedseach pfizer/biontech multidose vaccine contains between five and six doses , which means that during administration , some of the vaccine volume may be drawn up and expelled through a needle multiple times ( e.g . to adjust the volume in the syringe or expel bubbles ) . furthermore , the speed at which vaccine is drawn and expelled through a needle may also affect the integrity of the lipid nanoparticles . to assess whether encapsulated mrna vaccine is damaged during this process , 300 µl volume ( equivalent to one dose ) of vaccine was drawn and released through a 23 g needle ( the recommended by copyright . on january 10 , 2022 by exeter team . protected http : //openscience.bmj.com/ bmj open_science : first published as 10.1136/bmjos_2021_100203 on 13 september 2021 . downloaded from 5 kudsiova l , et al . bmj open_science 2021 ;

however , it was most pronounced with increasing the number of injections ( ie , five injections ) , in which case up to 2.7_ fold increase in mrna release was detected compared with the control ( this equated to ~31.2 % release compared with triton x_100 treatment ) . discussion this study highlights details that are , to our knowledge , not yet available in the literature , regarding the phys_ical stability of the pfizer_ biont ech covid_19 mrna bnt162b2 vaccine . these results are particularly perti_nent in view of the special precautions which have to be observed in handling this first in class mrna vaccine . physical stability due to the prioritised vaccine ’ s clinical use during the peak of the pandemic , it was deemed unethical to test ( and therefore waste ) full multidose bottles of vaccine , which is why samples from remaining vaccines after the doses were removed were tested in smaller volumes ( up to 300 µl ) in plastic tubes , which were comparable to single vaccine doses in plastic syringes . interestingly , the results showed that the vaccine ’ s stability can be compro_mised when mishandled , mainly by shaking the vaccine or exposing it to vibrations , and to a lesser extent , on figure 2 ( a ) hydr odynamic diameter ( left axis ) and polydispersity index ( right axis ) of covid_19 pfizer/biontech vaccine nanoparticles upon knocking over or dropping from various heights . numbers above bars are hydrodynamic diameter values ( nm ) . numbers below the scatter points are polydispersity indices . results were not significantly different from the control ( analysis of variance with dunnett post_ test ) . each data point was an average of thr ee measurements±sd .

however , it should be noted that small volume samples in plastic tubes rather than full multi_dose glass vials were tested , and biological efficacy has not been directly assessed in this study . the compromise in physical stability seen , particularly with shaking or exposing the vaccine to vibrations , endorses the need for close supervision of vaccine preparation , handling and administration in order to maintain stan_dards . as the experience of vaccinators increases , adher _ ence to pharmacy_ approved standard operating procedures continues to be an important control in reducing the risk of vaccine degradation . the desire to minimise wastage balanced against the risk of administering ineffective vaccine can create conflict in clinical decision making , and our data provide some indi_cation and reassurance of vaccine stability following very minor breaches in clinical use . author affiliations 1centre for stress and age_ rela ted disease , and centre for regenerative_medicine and devices , school of applied sciences , university of brighton , brighton , uk 2centre for stress and age_ rela ted disease and biomaterials and drug delivery research and enterprise group , school of applied sciences , university of brighton , brighton , uk 3medicines optimisation research and enterprise group , school of applied sciences , university of brighton , brighton , uk 4centre for stress and age_ rela ted disease , school of applied sciences , university of brighton , brighton , uk 5university hospitals sussex nhs foundation trust , brighton , uk 6independent general practitioner , brighton , ukby copyright . on january 10 , 2022 by exeter team . protected http : //openscience.bmj.com/ bmj open_science : first published as 10.1136/bmjos_2021_100203 on 13 september 2021 . downloaded from 8 kudsiova l , et al . bmj open_science 2021 ;

however , distribution systems at other temperatures can and do operate effectively in these countries . the target populations for most vaccines in lmics are children served by the expanded pro_ gramme on immunization ( epi ) . this 2–8°c distribution is also the common standard for vaccine cold chains in high_income coun_ tries and has become the default : any vaccine that does not ﬁt this mould is considered problematic , sometimes irrationally so , thus the initial negative portrayal in the media1of pﬁzer ’ s logistics operation despite a vaccine efﬁcacy of 95 % . the who stipulates that a ‘ vaccine or any component pre_ sented for prequaliﬁcation should not require storage at less than −20°c ’ .3furthermore , if a vaccine must be stored ‘ below +2°c during its shelf_life period , it should have a minimum period of storage above +2°c of 6 months ’ . ultra_low_temperature ( −80°c ) and cryogenic ( < −150°c ) cold chains do not ﬁt into these tradi_ tional recommendations for acceptance of new vaccines . never_ theless , ervebo upended this stipulation , setting a new precedent and also becoming the fastest vaccine yet to move through the approval and prequaliﬁcation process . ervebo is currently the sole licensed ( by the fda , european medicines agency , ghana , burundi , zambia and the democratic republic of the congo [ drc ] ) , who_prequaliﬁed human vac__cine that is distributed between −80°c and −60°c . ervebo was © the author ( s ) 2021 . published by oxford university press on behalf of royal society of tropical medicine and hygiene . this is an open_access article distributed under the terms of the creative_commons attribution license ( http : //creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ ) , which permits unrestricted reuse , distribution , and reproduction in any medium , provided the original work is properly cited . 211downloaded from https : //academic.oup.com/inthealth/article/13/3/211/6168514 by guest on 02 july 2024 e. r. james initially successfully distributed under compassionate use pro_ tocols to aid in containing the ebola outbreaks in west_africa in 2014–20164and more recently in the drc,5demonstrating that a vaccine with ultra_low temperature requirements can be deployed in lmic settings when the need is especially critical . the ervebo cold_chain bears little resemblance to a standard 2– 8°c cold_chain and its creation stimulated signiﬁcant innovation and the introduction of new equipment : for the ﬁrst leg , vac__cine vials were shipped to the main distribution hubs in insulated boxes with dry_ice ; from there to satellite stores at −60°c in ark_ tek shipping units using pre_conditioned phase_change panels to maintain temperature for up to 6 d ; and ﬁnally the vaccine was thawed , loaded into syringes and 12 syringes sent same day in cryo_q cold boxes to the immunization clinics.4 cold_chain extremes the holy_grail for vaccine developers and logisticians is a vac__cine that can be stored and transported at ambient temper_ atures . no licensed vaccine yet meets this standard , although vivotif , the orally administered vaccine against typhoid fever , formulated as enteric_coated capsules , is probably closest . sev_ eral candidate vaccines in early_stage development employ ‘ new ’ methods of thermostabilization such as spray_drying and foam drying6that may yet yield licensed products stable at ambi_ ent temperatures . at the other end of the scale , the chimeric antigen receptor t_cell ( car_t ) products kymriah and yescarta and the malaria vaccine sanaria®pfspz vaccine , now entering phase 3 trials , contain cryopreserved live eukaryotic cells that are stabilized by cryopreservation and are stored and transported at < −150°c using liquid nitrogen vapour phase ( lnvp ) as the refrigerant . limits of the chains there are advantages and disadvantages to storage and distri_ bution with each of the four categories of temperature_deﬁned cold chains ( 2–8°c , −20°c , −80°c and < −150°c ) . the main dis_ advantage of the 2–8°c cold_chain is its reliance on refrigera_ tors that can only maintain the temperature for short periods when electricity supply is interrupted—a not infrequent scenario in lmics . propane or solar_powered refrigerators can provide in_ dependence from the electricity grid or from generators . never_ theless , even with a reliable electricity supply , as in high_income countries , maintaining vaccine within the narrow window of 2– 8°c is not easy and temperature excursions are common . per_ haps counterintuitively , freezing may be the most frequent cause of vaccine loss during transportation and storage,7with vac__cines that contain alum as adjuvant being particularly sensitive . both freezing and high_temperature excursions reduce vaccine potency , so to protect vaccines , vial monitoring methods such as labels with thermosensitive components that change colour based on the extent and duration of out_of_speciﬁcation tem_ peratures are used to report thermal histories . car_t products are shipped with real_time monitors recording temperature , hu_ midity , tilt , shock and global positioning system location data foreach shipment ; some of these parameters are monitored for the pﬁzer and moderna vaccine shipments . increasingly , many 3pl and courier companies are including electronic monitoring de_ vices , accessible via mobile device apps , for distribution of high_ value products . a second reason why typical 2–8°c and −20°c cold chains can be problematic is their design . the standard epi cold_chain uti_ lizes a sequence of storage facilities extending from the manu_ facturer to the immunization clinic that rely on refrigerators and freezers . for example , the vaccine cold_chain in tanzania , estab_ lished by the medical stores department and now run by the epi,8 consists of the main hub in dar_es_salaam , nine zonal depots , up to 24 district depots in each zone and ﬁnally a total of 8,497 ( in 2020 ) health facilities ( hospitals , health centres , clinics and dis_ pensaries ) . such multistop distribution networks ( figure 1 ) p r o _ vide multiple opportunities for temperature excursions , handling errors and equipment failure . ( the tanzanian cold_chain is actu_ ally better than many and has been one of the most studied ) . simpliﬁed distribution networks with three or even two stops— a central depot supplying immunization clinics directly—improve control and reduce the chance for temperature and equipment failure . this hub_and_spoke model of distribution ( figure 1 ) i su s e d in the usa for distributing childhood vaccines for the centers_for_disease_control directly from two central hubs , as well as sea_ sonal inﬂuenza vaccines and now the moderna covid_19 vac__cine in partnership with the us government ’ s warp speed pro_ gram . similar simpliﬁed networks for the epi have been trialled successfully in recent years in senegal ( the moving warehouse study of project optimize ) 9and in tunisia and vietnam . lnvp_ based < −150°c cold chains utilize the hub_and_spoke model . vaccine containers all vaccines , except those distributed at cryogenic temperatures , are manufactured in glass vials closed using a synthetic stopper held in place by a crimped aluminum cap . the main drawback to this vial design is that it limits storage temperatures to > −80°c . however , product stability improves as the temperature of storage decreases , down to the glass transition temperature ( ap_ proximately −135°c for aqueous_based products ) . for vaccines stored at 2–8°c , a one_log loss in potency over 12–18 months is quite common and accepted in the industry . in marked contrast , vaccines stored at cryogenic temperatures < −150°c experience no loss in potency over many years of storage . with glass vials , the seal between the vial and its stopper opens at temperatures < −80°c due to the differential contractility of the components and loss in elasticity of the stopper . to maintain container closure integrity for products stored at cryogenic temperatures , different containers are employed . car_t products , where volumes are larger , use bags or plastic vials accessed by sealed tubes ( e.g . cook regentec , indianapolis , in , usa ) . high_throughput ﬁlling , cryogenic storage and distribution of vaccines in smaller volumes can be accomplished with closed_ﬁll vials ( aseptic technologies , gembloux , belgium ) or with plastic vials containing a seal_ protected septum ( sio 2materials science , auburn , al , vials ) . by using such containers , the beneﬁts of the cryogenic cold_chain option could be extended to other vaccines . 212downloaded from https : //academic.oup.com/inthealth/article/13/3/211/6168514 by guest on 02 july 2024 international health figure 1 . comparison between the traditional vaccine distribution system , similar to that of the epi , and the hub_and_spoke system , similar to that used in distributing childhood vaccines for the centers_for_disease_control . advantages of lnvp cold chains using lnvp are also more efﬁcient and easier to op_ erate than those using ultra_low_temperature freezers and dry_ice , which is especially difﬁcult to obtain in many lmics . liq_ uid nitrogen is available almost everywhere in the world , and lnvp cryoshippers , after arriving in the clinic , double as tempo_ rary storage repositories for 7–14 d , or longer with liquid nitro_ gen recharges , and need no electricity . there are around 11 vet_ erinary vaccines , including the cattle vaccine against east_coast fever in east_africa , that are transported using liquid nitrogen as refrigerant and the lnvp cold_chain supports a huge international livestock breeding industry . pfspz vaccine against malaria has been successfully distributed to > 13 clinical_trials sites , including to 9 sites in 6 countries of sub_saharan africa , using the lnvp_ based cold_chain . for reasons of controllability and efﬁciency , cer_ tain types of refrigerator trucks equipped with piping injection systems use liquid nitrogen for transporting vaccines and other products not only at < −150°c , but also at −20°c and −80°c . not just the vaccine ancillary supplies accompanying all vaccines include syringes , needles , disinfecting wipes and safety boxes for sharps . addition_ ally , several frozen vaccines , those that come in multidose vials ( e.g . pﬁzer ’ s covid_19 vaccine ) and vaccines that are lyophilized also require a diluent . these components are shipped at ambient temperatures , but their cumulative bulk and weight can be sig_ niﬁcant . for 1 million_doses of the pﬁzer–biontech vaccine , > 205 thermal shippers cumulatively weighing ∼7.5 metric tons includ_ ing dry_ice and occupying 19 m3are required . and the ancillary supplies include > 1.2 million syringes with needles and 200 000 vials ( containing a total of 400 l ) of saline diluent . the estimated weight and volume of these ancillary supplies is ∼16 metric tons occupying > 250 m3 . cumulatively , this amounts to a trans_ portation capacity requirement equivalent to three fully loaded 18_wheeler articulated trucks with 16 m trailers , and this must be repeated again for the second dose of a two_dose regimen vaccine.legacy disruption the speed with which the new covid_19 vaccines have been developed has been spectacular . complementing this has been the ramp up in distribution logistics . at the main vaccine distribution hubs in the usa , europe and elsewhere for the pﬁzer and moderna vaccines and others , logistics companies , largely with funding from governments , have invested heavily in the infrastructure to rapidly handle tens of millions of doses . this infrastructure includes the ultra_low_temperature freezer farms ( warehouses ) that have featured prominently in the media , and experience is continuing to improve the last_mile distribution to the immunization sites . one legacy of sudden acute respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus 2 will be multiple im_ provements to vaccine distribution systems at all cold_chain temperatures , but particularly a tried and tested ultra_low_ temperature cold_chain capable of handling vaccines at scale against the next pandemic and , in the meantime , available to encourage development of variants of existing vaccines to take advantage of the −80°c to −60°c cold_chain distribution infrastructure . acknowledgements : the author acknowledges partial support from small business research innovation awards from the us national_institute_of_allergy_and_infectious_diseases (

however , these actions have been variably implemented and have proved insufficient in impeding the spread of coronavi _ rus disease 2019 ( covid_19 ) , the disease caused by sars_cov_2 . vaccines are needed to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with covid_19 , and multiple platforms have been involved in the rapid development of vaccine candidates.1_9 the mrna vaccine platform has advantages as a pandemic_response strategy , given its flexi _ bility and efficiency in immunogen design and manufacturing . earlier work had suggested that the spike_protein of the coronavirus responsible for the 2002 sars outbreak was a suitable target for protective immunity.10 numerous vaccine can _ didates in various stages of development are now being evaluated.11_13 shortly after the sars_cov_2 genetic sequence was determined in january 2020 , mrna_1273 , a lipid_nanoparticle ( lnp ) – encapsulated mrna vaccine expressing the pre _ fusion_stabilized spike glycoprotein , was developed by moderna and the vaccine research center at the national_institute_of_allergy_and_infectious_diseases ( niaid ) , within the national_institutes_of_health ( nih ) .14 the mrna_1273 vaccine dem _ onstrated protection in animal_challenge experi _ ments15 and encouraging safety and immunoge _ nicity in early_stage human testing.1,4 the efficacy and safety of another mrna vaccine , bnt162b2 , was recently demonstrated.16 the coronavirus efficacy ( cove ) phase 3 trial was launched in late july 2020 to assess the safety and efficacy of the mrna_1273 vaccine in preventing sars_cov_2_infection . an independent data and safety monitoring board determined that the vaccine met the prespecified efficacy criteria at the first interim_analysis . we report the primary analysis results of this ongoing pivotal phase 3 trial . methods trial oversight this phase 3 randomized , stratified , observer_ blinded , placebo_controlled trial enrolled adults in medically stable condition at 99 u.s. sites . participants received the first trial injection be _ tween july 27 and october 23 , 2020 . the trial is being conducted in accordance with the inter _ national council for harmonisation of techni _ cal requirements for pharmaceuticals for hu _ man use , good clinical practice guidelines , and applicable government regulations . the cen _ tral institutional_review_board approved the protocol and the consent forms . all partici__ pants provided written informed_consent be _ fore enrollment . safety is reviewed by a protocol safety review team weekly and by an indepen _ dent data and safety monitoring board on a continual basis . the trial investigational new drug sponsor , moderna , was responsible for the overall trial design ( with input from the biomedical advanced research and develop _ ment authority , the niaid , the covid_19 pre _ vention network , and the trial cochairs ) , site selection and monitoring , and data analysis . investigators are responsible for data collection . a medical writer funded by moderna assisted in drafting the manuscript for submission . the authors vouch for the accuracy and complete _ ness of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol . the trial is ongoing , and the investigators remain unaware of participant_ level data . designated team members within moderna have unblinded access to the data , to facilitate interface with the regulatory agencies and the data and safety monitoring board ;

however , the trial was not designed to evaluate the efficacy of a single dose , and additional evaluation is war _ ranted . the magnitude of mrna_1273 vaccine effi _ cacy at preventing symptomatic sars_cov_2 in _ fection is higher than the efficacy observed for vaccines for respiratory viruses , such as the in _ activated influenza vaccine against symptomatic , virologically confirmed disease in adults , for which studies have shown a pooled efficacy of 59 % .19 this high apparent efficacy of mrna_ 1273 is based on short_term data , and waning of efficacy over time has been demonstrated with other vaccines.20 also , the efficacy of the vaccine was tested in a setting of national recommenda _ tions for masking and social distancing , which may have translated into lower levels of infec _ tious inoculum . the efficacy of mrna_1273 is in line with that of the recently reported bnt162b2 mrna vaccine.16 the cove trial is ongoing , and longitudinal follow_up will allow an assessment of efficacy changes over time and under evolving epidemiologic conditions . overall , the safety of the mrna_1273 vaccine regimen and platform is reassuring ; no unex _ pected patterns of concern were identified . the reactogenicity associated with immunization with mrna_1273 in this trial is similar to that in the phase 1 data reported previously.1,4 over_ all , the local reactions to vaccination were mild ; however , moderate_to_severe systemic side ef _ fects , such as fatigue , myalgia , arthralgia , and headache , were noted in about 50 % of partici__ pants in the mrna_1273 group after the second dose . these side_effects were transient , starting about 15 hours after vaccination and resolving in most participants by day 2 , without sequelae . the degree of reactogenicity after one dose of mrna_1273 was less than that observed for the recently approved recombinant adjuvanted zoster vaccine and after the second mrna_1273 dose was similar to that of the zoster vaccine.21,22 delayed injection_site reactions , with an onset figure 3 ( facing page ) . vaccine efficacy of mrna_1273 to prevent covid_19 . shown is the cumulative_incidence of covid_19 events in the primary analysis based on adjudicated assess _ ment starting 14 days after the second vaccination in the per_protocol population ( panel a ) and after ran _ domization in the modified intention_to_treat popula _ tion ( panel b ) ( see the supplementary appendix ) . the dotted line in panel a indicates day 42 ( 14 days after vaccination 2 ) , when the per_protocol follow_up began , and arrows in both panels indicate days 1 and 29 , when injections were administered . tick marks indicate cen _ sored data . vaccine efficacy was defined as 1 minus the hazard_ratio ( mrna vs. placebo ) , and the 95 % confi _ dence interval was estimated with the use of a stratified cox proportional hazards model , with efron ’ s method of tie handling and with treatment group as a covariate , with adjustment for stratification factor . incidence was defined as the number of events divided by number of participants at risk and was adjusted by person_years . symptomatic covid_19 case accrual for placebo and vac _ cine in the modified intention_to_treat population is dis _ played ( does not include asymptomatic cases of sars__cov_2 detected at the day 29 by nasopharyngeal swab ) . the new england journal of medicine downloaded_from_nejm.org on july 2 , 2024 . for personal use only . no other uses without permission . copyright © 2021 massachusetts medical society . all rights reserved . n engl j med 384 ;

however , no such risk was evident in the cove trial , although the ability to detect rare events is limited , given the trial sample_size . the anecdotal finding of a slight excess of bell ’ s palsy in this trial and in the bnt162b2 vaccine trial arouses concern that it may be more than a chance event , and the possibility bears close monitoring.16 the mrna_1273 vaccine did not show evi _ dence in the short term of enhanced respiratory_disease after infection , a concern that emerged from animal models used in evaluating some sars and middle_east respiratory syndrome ( mers ) vaccine constructs.23_25 a hallmark of enhanced respiratory_disease is a th2_skewed immune response and eosinophilic pulmonary infiltration on histopathological examination . of note , preclinical testing of mrna_1273 and other sars_cov_2 vaccines in advanced clinical evaluation has shown a th1_skewed vaccine re _ sponse and no pathologic lung infiltrates.15,26_28 whether mrna_1273 vaccination results in en _ hanced disease on exposure to the virus in the long term is unknown . key limitations of the data are the short dura _ tion of safety and efficacy follow_up . the trial is ongoing , and a follow_up duration of 2 years is planned , with possible changes to the trial de _ sign to allow participant retention and ongoing data collection . another limitation is the lack of an identified correlate of protection , a critical tool for future bridging studies . as of the data cutoff , 11 cases of covid_19 had occurred in the mrna_1273 group , a finding that limits our ability to detect a correlate of protection . as cases accrue and immunity wanes , it may be _figure 4 . vaccine efficacy of mrna_1273 to prevent covid_19 in subgroups . the efficacy of the rna_1273 vaccine in preventing covid_19 in various subgroups in the per_protocol population was based on adjudicated assessments starting 14 days after the second injection . vaccine efficacy , defined as 1 minus the hazard_ratio ( mrna_1273 vs. placebo ) , and 95 % confidence_intervals were estimated with the use of a stratified cox proportional hazards model , with efron ’ s method of tie handling and with the treatment group as a covariate , adjusting for stratification factor if applicable . race and ethnic group categories shown are white ( non_ hispanic ) and communities of color ( all others , excluding those whose race and ethnicity were both reported as un _ known , were not reported , or were both missing at screening ) . data for communities of color were pooled owing to limited numbers of participants in each racial or ethnic group , to ensure that the subpopulations would be large enough for meaningful analyses.50 25 75 100all patients age ≥18 to < 65 yr ≥65 yr age , risk for severe covid_19 18 to < 65 yr , not at risk 18 to < 65 yr , at risk ≥65 yr sex male female at risk for severe covid_19 yes no race and ethnic group white communities of colorplacebo ( n=14,073 ) mrna_1273 ( n=14,134 ) vaccine/uni0020efficacy/uni0020 ( 95 % /uni0020ci ) subgroup 97.5 ( 82.2–99.7 ) 95.1 ( 89.6–97.7 ) 93.2 ( 87.1–96.4 ) 90.9 ( 74.7–96.7 ) 95.4 ( 87.4–98.3 ) 86.4 ( 61.4–95.2 ) 93.1 ( 85.2–96.8 ) 95.9 ( 90.0–98.3 ) 94.4 ( 76.9–98.7 ) 94.1 ( 89.3–96.8 ) 095.6 ( 90.6–97.9 ) 86.4 ( 61.4–95.2 ) 185/14,073 156/10,521 29/3552 121/8403 35/2118 29/3552 87/7462 98/6611 43/3167 142/10,906 144/8916 41/5132 11/14,134 7/10,551 4/3583 5/8396 2/2155 4/3583 4/7366 7/6768 4/3206 7/10,928 10/9023 1/5088no . of events/total no . the new england journal of medicine downloaded_from_nejm.org on july 2 , 2024 . for personal use only . no other uses without permission . copyright © 2021 massachusetts medical society . all rights reserved . n engl j med 384 ;

vaccination with both the pfizer and moderna versions have been reported and reached public attention . public alarm washeightened following the death of the first identified patient from anintracranial hemorrhage , which was reported on the internet , then in usa today 1and then in the new york times.2described below , we have collected a series of cases of very low platelet counts occurringwithin 2 weeks of vaccination in order to enhance our understanding of the possible relationship , if any , between sars_cov_2 vaccination and development of itp with implications for surveillance andmanagement . twenty case_reports of patients with thrombocytopenia following vaccination , 17 without pre_existing thrombocytopenia and 14 withreported bleeding symptoms prior to hospitalization were identified upon review of data available from the centers_for_disease_control and prevention ( cdc ) , the food and drug administration ( fda ) , agencies of the u.s. department of health and human services ( hhs ) vaccine adverse_events reporting system ( vaers ) , published reports , 3,4and via direct communication with patients and treating providers . these cases were investigated as suspicious for new onset , post_vaccination secondary itp ; we could not exclude exacerbation of clinically undetected itp . search terms relating to “ decreased plateletcount ” , “ immune thrombocytopenia ” , “ hemorrhage ” , “ petechiae ” , and “ contusion ” were utilized to identify cases reported in vaers . the reports describing 19 of 20 patients included age ( range 22–73 years old ; median 41 years ) and gender ( 11 females and 8 males ) . nine received the pfizer vaccine and 11 received the moderna vaccine . all 20 patients were hospitalized and most patients presented with petechiae , bruising or mucosal bleeding ( gingival , vagi_nal , epistaxis ) with onset of symptoms between 1 –23 days ( median 5 days ) post vaccination . platelet counts at presentation were avail_ able for all 20 cases with the majority being at or below 10 ×10 9/l ( range 1 –36×109/l ; median 2 ×109/l ) . one patient had known itp in remission ; another had mild – moderate thrombocytopenia in 2019 with note of positive anti_plate_let antibodies , a third had previous mild thrombocytopenia ( 145 × 10 9/l ) while a fourth had inherited thrombocytopenia with baseline platelet counts of 40 –60×109/l . three other patients had known autoimmune conditions including hypothyroidism , crohns disease , orpositive tests for anti_thyroglobulin antibodies . treatment for suspected itp was described in 15 of the cases , including corticoste_ roids n = 14 , intravenous immune globulin ( ivig ) n = 12 , platelet trans_fusions n = 8 , rituximab n = 2 , romiplostim = 1 , vincristine = 1 , and aminocaproic acid ( amicar ) n = 1 ; combination_therapy was used inreceived : 6 february 2021 revised : 15 february 2021 accepted : 16 february 2021 doi :

in the platelet count was described in patients treatedwith platelet transfusion alone ( n = 1 ) , corticosteroids alone ( n = 1 ) , corticosteroids + platelet transfusion ( n = 3 ) , corticosteroids + ivig ( n = 3 ) , corticosteroids + ivig + platelet transfusion ( n = 5 ) , corticoste_roids +ivig + rituximab + vincristine + romiplostim ( n = 1 ) . the index patient passed away after a cerebral_hemorrhage , as mentioned , not_ withstanding having received emergent treatment with ivig , steroids , rituximab and platelet transfusions . another patient had no improve_ ment in platelet counts after 3 days , but treatment details are not specified . five additional patients with ” thrombocytopenia ” or ” immune thrombocytopenia ” post vaccination were identified in vaers ( last accessed 2/5/21 ) , but either available information is insufficient for inclusion or the clinical scenarios suggest alternative processes con_tributing to thrombocytopenia . one 59 year_old man was identified with ” thrombocytopenia ” at an unspecified time after receiving the pfizer vaccine without additional details regarding platelet count , clini_cal course , or treatment . a 44 year_old woman was hospitalized for nausea , vomiting and chest_pain on the day that she received the pfizer vaccine . her laboratory values included a platelet count of85×10 9/l and a peak troponin level of 4 ng/ml ( normal < = 0.04 ng/ ml ) . the patient was diagnosed with myocarditis but did not require treatment for thrombocytopenia . her platelets were 61 ×109/l on discharge , but subsequent platelet counts were not reported . thethird is a patient without age or gender reported who was found to have thrombocytopenia , neutropenia and a pulmonary_embolism at an unspecified time following the pfizer vaccine . this patient was hospi_talized and passed away ; no additional details were available . a fourth patient , a 37_year_old man , had ” thrombocytopenia requiring hospital_ ization , meds and platelet infusion ” 4 days following the moderna vaccine with no details regarding presenting symptoms , platelet count , treatment or outcome . the last patient is an 80 year_old man with multiple medical problems including recent transcatheter aortic valvereplacement , hypothyroidism , and diverticulosis who presented6 days after the pfizer vaccine with bloody diarrhea , hemoglobin 8.7 g/dl and platelets 60 ×10 9/l . he received several units of packed red blood cells and two units of platelets with improvement to101×10 9/l and was discharged 5 days later . there were a handful of reports with minimal additional details alluding to a male who passed away in december from brain hemorrhage following the pfizer vac_cine –these could be describing the index patient . we did not attempt to obtain information on patients with pre_existing active itp who received a sars_cov_2 vaccine for this report . we identified additional reports of post_vaccination bruising or bleeding unrelated to the injection_site , but no mention of platelet counts , or thrombocytopenia , was provided . note , vaers was lastaccessed on january 29 , 2021 for this search . fourteen patientsreported ” petechiae ” / ” bruising ” of whom three were evaluated in the office and one presented to the emergency room . there have been 51 reports of ” bleeding ” / ” hemorrhage ” ( vaginal n = 11 , conjunctival n = 13 , cerebral n = 6 , gingival n = 2 , gastrointestinal n = 5 , epistaxis n = 12 , and cutaneous n = 2 ) . there were 31 patients who did notseek additional evaluation , seven were seen via office visits , while 13 presented to the emergency room or were hospitalized . twopatients passed away in the hospital . no additional details are available . are these case of primary itp coincident with or secondary itp as a result of vaccination ? in either case , the clinical presentations and the favorable response to “ itp_directed ” therapies in most of the treated patients , such as corticosteroids and ivig suggest anantibody_mediated platelet clearance mechanism that is operative in itp . is the relationship between vaccination and thrombocytopenia coincident or causal ? it is not surprising that 17 possible de novocases would be detected among the well over 20 million people who have received at least one dose of these two vaccines in the united_states as of february 2 , 2021 . this would be less than one case in amillion vaccinated persons , consistent with the absence of cases seen in the more than 70 000 subjects enrolled in the combined pfizer and moderna vaccine trials . 5,6if we assume that these reports identify 17 cases of secondary itp that developed following vaccination , this extrapolates to 17 ×6 ( because only cases that occurred during the first 2 months [ december 2020 –january 2021 ] following vaccine rollout are captured ) ×15 to cover the fraction of the population that has been vaccinated [ 20 million of the 300+ million total us population ] ) = approximately 1500 cases of post_vaccine secondaryitp/year . there are approximately 50 000 adults who are diagnosedwith itp in the us each year . if we explored the temporal relationship of the 17 cases occurring within 1_2 weeks of vaccination , then we could extrapolate by multiplying by 26 or 52 weeks to look at the rateof itp per year if the cases are totally ‘ coincidental ’ . this would be approximately 39,000 to 78,000 cases of itp per year which is not far from the estimated total baseline incidence per year . thus , the inci_dence of an immune_mediated thrombocytopenia post sars_cov_2 vaccination appears either less than or roughly comparable to what would be seen if the cases were coincidental following vaccination , perhaps enhanced somewhat by heightened surveillance of symptom_atic patients . these estimates are very rough so this information should be considered very preliminary . it also assumes that all cases of clinically significant itp are reported . the incidence of secondary itp following other types of vaccines provides an inconsistent picture . it is estimated that approximately 1:40 000 children develop secondary itp after receiving measles_mumps_rubella ( mmr ) vaccine . 7well_documented cases of acquired immune thrombocytopenia have been reported after varicella and other vaccinations as well , including one described in this issue of theamerican journal of hematology following shingrix recombinant zoster vaccine . 8_10on the other hand , the only case –controlled study of adult recipients of all vaccines published 10 years ago was interpretedas indicating no discernable increase in itp within 1 year post vaccina_tion . 11in the absence of pre_vaccination platelet counts and given the variable time post vaccination to discovery of thrombocytopenia , it is impossible to precisely estimate the incidence of secondary itp postsars_cov_2 vaccination at this time . however , it is notable that all but one of the cases identified thus far occurred after the initial dosecommentary 535 10968652 , 2021 , 5 , downloaded from https : //onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajh.26132 by university of illinois

governed by the applicable creative_commons license of sars_cov_2 vaccine . one would assume that if the vaccination was unrelated to development of itp , case occurrences would dividemore evenly between the two doses . it is also likely that the actual incidence of thrombocytopenia , including mild asymptomatic cases , may be higher and go unreported . even in view of the uncertain relationship between sars_cov_2 vaccination and secondary itp , it is worth considering possible mech_ anisms by which this might occur . thrombocytopenia has beenreported after treatment with some anti_sense oligonucleotides , 12,13 but it would seem that a far higher , sustained level of rna reachingdendritic cells in lymph nodes and elsewhere would be required togenerate an immune response than is likely seen based on a singleintramuscular injection . this is also inconsistent with the very rapid onset of thrombocytopenia in the index and additional cases . another possibility is that some individuals may have pre_formed antibodies , including those directed against poly_ethylene_glycol or to other components of the outer lipid layer of the nanoparticles . this presumes that antibodies directed against a novel antigen formed byattachment of vaccine particles on a small number of platelets trigger a reaction involving “ all ” platelets , which seems unlikely . recent arti_ cles identified antibodies detected post covid_19 infection that acti_vated platelets 14and an itp_like syndrome following natural infection15,16 ; both findings require confirmation and the relationship to the post vaccination itp cases reported here is uncertain . third , some patients may have had mild “ compensated ” thrombo_ cytopenia of diverse causes , for example , pre_existing itp or heredi_ tary thrombocytopenia . for example , one of the patients reported in this issue of the american journal of hematology had a documented borderline platelet count ( 145 ×109/l ) 2 months prior to receipt of the vaccine raising the question of pre_existing subclinical itp.3the other patient reported in this issue of the american journal of hema_ tology had chronic , hereditary thrombocytopenia , with a last known exacerbation 12 years prior to the present episode.4an additional patient identified in vaers had platelets of 55 –115×109/l in 2019 . severe thrombocytopenia in these patients or others may have beeninduced by enhancement of macrophage_mediated clearance or impaired platelet production as part of a systemic inflammatory response to vaccination . 8,17this is compatible with patients in whom severe thrombocytopenia was first noted 1 –3 days post_vaccination . transient drops in platelet counts post vaccinations for influenza and other viruses is a not uncommon observation in patients with itp andother causes of thrombocytopenia . lastly , post_vaccination itp remains possible , especially in those with onset 1_2 weeks after exposure . one patient in our series had anormal platelet count documented in the week prior to receipt of the vaccine and only developed symptomatology 13 days_post vaccina__tion compatible with vaccine related secondary itp . the reported cases also provide insight into diagnosis and treat_ ment . most of the patients responded to treatment with corticoste_ roids and ivig but showed little benefit from platelet transfusion , a pattern consistent with that of itp . there was no response in the twopatients treated with rituximab but they were only evaluable for up to 2 weeks ; in addition , rituximab would impair the response tovaccination , if given within days to 2 weeks of the vaccination and for at least 4_6 months subsequently . the first of two patients ( with suffi_cient information available ) continued to have a platelet count of 1 –2 ×10 9/l and died of intracranial bleeding 16 days_post vaccination and 13 days_post presentation of itp despite receiving platelet trans_fusions , steroids , ivig , and rituximab . the second patient presented 1 day after vaccination and still had a count of 1 ×10 9/l 7 days later despite receiving the same combination of the four itp treatments ; however , she responded following addition of vincristine and romiplostim . the suggestion might be ( from this very limited informa_ tion ) to give ivig and high dose steroids as initial treatment . if thisdoes not work and the platelet count remains very low , it would seemappropriate to institute other treatments within the first week includ_ ing a thrombopoietic agent perhaps starting above the lowest dose often recommended to initate therapy and potentially vinca alkaloidsdepending upon response . excluding rituximab from initial treatment seems appropriate in most cases given that response can take up to 8 weeks 18and response to vaccination can be impaired . once a plate_ let response is seen , patients could be managed as if they were typical cases of primary itp . whether such cases will prove to be self_limiting or persist and lead to chronic itp remains uncertain . in summary , we can not exclude the possibility that the pfizer and moderna vaccines have the potential to trigger de novo itp ( including clinically undiagnosed cases ) , albeit very rarely . distinguishingvaccine_induced itp from coincidental itp presenting soon after vac_cination is impossible at this time . additional surveillance is needed to determine the true incidence of thrombocytopenia post vaccination . if the incidence of thrombocytopenia post vaccination is higher thanthat based on available case_reports , we anticipate that many more cases will be reported in the coming weeks as a higher proportion of the population is vaccinated . it may be worthwhile to see whetherexacerbations of other conditions considered to have an autoimmune pathophysiology occur as well to gain a better understanding of host response to vaccination . notwithstanding these concerns , the incidence of symptomatic thrombocytopenia post vaccination is well below the risk of death and morbidity from sars_cov_2_infection as also described on the platelet disorder support associat ion ( pdsa ) website in the state_ ment from the medical advisory board . we echo recommendations from the pdsa and the american society of hematology that strongly encourage reporting this and other potential complications through vaers and in any other way deemed appropriate . finally , we recommend immediately checking a platelet count in anyone who reports abnormal bleeding or bruising following vaccinationand consulting a hematologist . management of vaccination in patients with pre_existing itp is complex and is not explored here . the opinion of the medicaladvisory board of pdsa is that in most , but not necessarily all , patients the benefit of vaccinat ion exceeds the risk of exacerbat_ ing itp . at this time , for patients with itp it appears reasonable to obtain a baseline count before vaccination and then obtainadditional platelet count ( s ) f ollowing vaccination based on patient clinical and treatment history . in patients who present with536 commentary 10968652 , 2021 ,

and moderna mrna vaccines rashed noor1 accepted : 18 february 2021 # the author ( s ) , under exclusive licence to springer nature switzerland ag part of springer nature 2021 abstract purpose of review along with the continued in silico_based studies for drug designing and repurposing followed by the corresponding cell culture studies , the ongoing clinical_trials with some completed regarding finding the drug efficacy and the vaccine development against the severe_acute_respiratory coronavirus 2 ( sars_cov_2 ) have been the most functional and indispensable issue during the current covid_19 pandemic within 2020 and onward . the present review attempted to figure out the update on this effective vaccine and discussed the other promising vaccines . recent findings a range of investigations on the sars_cov_2 genomics , on its similarities with sars_cov_1 , and with the middle_east respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus ( mers_cov ) have been accomplished and the host immune dodging mecha_ nisms by the sars_cov_2 have been unraveled which in turn led the scientists around the world to work rigorously on the vaccine development . working with various vaccine platforms so far revealed the efficacy of the mrna_1273 vaccine as the most effective one as resulted through the clinical_trials which resulted in 95 % positive output . summary although currently commercialized mrna_1273 vaccine appears to be effective , still several points are to be pon_ dered regarding the sustainability of vaccine efficacy against the rising variants of sars_cov_2 . keywords covid_19 pandemic .sars_cov_2 .mrna vaccines introduction respiratory viral infections and the associated pandemic have quite a long history of more than 130 years . the first dreadful pandemic , the russian influenza ( 1889 –1892 ) caused by the influenza a virus subtype h2n2 , accounted for more than a million of deaths worldwide , and within the 30 years ahead , in 1918 –1920 , the spanish_flu pandemic took more than 50 mil_ lion lives [ 1 ] . after 100 years of spanish flu , the ongoing covid_19 pandemic ( originating from bats in wuhan , china , at the end of december 2019 lasting till date ) caused by the severe_acute_respiratory coronavirus 2 ( sars_cov_2 ) has appeared to be the horrific viral infection threat to the global public health , already causing 1,744,235 deaths out of 78,604,532 confirmed cases worldwide with a prodigious in_ crease in the number of infected individuals within a year [ 1 , 2 ] . indeed , till the prevalence of coronaviruses ( sars_cov in 2002 –2003 , causing 774 deaths in 24 countries , and the middle_east respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus or mers_ cov endemic in 2012 , followed by the current sars_cov_ 2 instigated covid_19 pandemic ) , in 1957 –1959 , the asian influenza caused around 0.7 million deaths , and the causative virus subtype h2n2 lasted for 11 years ending up to hong_kong influenza in 1968 causing 1 million deaths [ 1 ] . regarding the first step for the coronavirus pathogenicity , this is already very well known that sars_cov_2 spike ( s ) protein s1 subunit in trimer ( which associates at the top of s2 subunit to form the immune dominant , multifunctional , trans_ membrane moiety facilitating the viral attachment fusion and entry into the host_cell ) employs the same receptor , i.e. , the human

microbiology reports ( 2021 ) 8:178–185 same binding_site ( receptor_binding domain or rbd ) as sars_cov applied on the host_cell [ 3–5 ] . moreover , approx_ imately 79 % genetic similarities have been noticed between the sars_cov and sars_cov_2 with a significant differ_ ence in the presence of the furin cleavage site ( possibly con_ ferring the covid_19 severity upon viral pathogenesis ) with the masked and glycan shielded s protein ( which can also dodge the host protective immunity ) of sars_cov_2 , primed by the host transmembrane serine 2 ( tmprss2 ) and the host endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsins b and l ( catb/l ) [ 3 , 4,6 ] . however , the genetic resemblance mostly between the current sars_cov_2 and the previous version of this corona_ virus , sars_cov ( and with a little extent , around 50 % on mers_cov which used dipeptidyl peptidase or dpp4 as the host receptor ) , may be useful in the development of effective vaccine against sars_cov_2 using any of the known plat_ forms of vaccine preparation , i.e. , ( 1 ) inactivated or live atten_ uated viruses ( representative trials : nct04412538 and nct04324606 , both in phase i ) , ( 2 ) the virus coated or pro_ tein subunit vaccines ( representative trial nct04405908 in phase ii ) , ( 3 ) virus_like particles ( vlp ) , ( 4 ) the replicating and nonreplicating viral vectors ( adenovirus vaccines : trial nct04341389 in phase ii ) , ( 5 ) nanoparticles , ( 6 ) the dna vaccines ( representative trial nct04368988 in phase i ) or ( 7 ) rna vaccines ( representative trials : nct04405076 and nct04368728 in phase_iii and phase i , respectively ) , ( 8 ) application of oral delivery of plasmid constructs of the s protein , ( 9 ) adjuvant recombinant protein , and ( 10 ) the engineered bacterial vaccines with the principal aim to trigger the production of s protein neutralizing_antibodies [ 3,6,7 ] . therefore , according to the ongoing covid_19 vaccine de_ velopment clinical_trials , ver y few , especially the mrna vac__cines , are under phase_iii while other studies may need 3 years more [ 6 ] . the current review attemp t e dt oi m p a r ta nu p d a t eo n the potential covid_19 vaccine c andidates with the success of the mrna vaccines as the biologic ally licensed vaccines in the light of completed and ongoing clinical_trials and to focus on t h ep o s s i b l ep o t e n t i a l so fo t h e r vaccines as well . the associated risks upon vaccine administration have also been discussed . potential candidate vaccine candidates prior to the discussion about the vaccines , it is to be recalled that there are three possible approaches for the treatment and pre_ vention against covid_19 : ( 1 ) the immunomodulatory agents and the repurposed antiviral drugs ( i.e. , drugs that are already approved to treat other diseases such as the ebola virus disease , aids , and malaria and to observ e whether they are effective against infecting sars_cov_2 into the patients , like remdesivir , lopinavir , dexametha sone , and ritonavir ) ; ( 2 ) intro_ ducing the covid_19 patients with the antibodies ( convales_ cent plasma therapy or the passive antibody therapy ) eitherfrom the convalescent donors ( patients who have recovered from the disease ) or manufactured through the recombinant dna technology ; and ( 3 ) finally , by developing vaccines against the viruses using various platforms including the protein subunit vaccines , rna vaccines , nonreplicating viral vaccines , attenuated viral vaccines , the virus_like particles , replicating viral vaccines , dna vaccines , and the live attenuated vaccines ( lavs ) which are currently under extensive research [ 3,4,8 , 9 ] . among the protein subunit vaccine candidates , the nvx_ cov2373 ( a nanoparticle_based immunogenic vaccine ) , the molecular clamp stabilized s p rotein vaccine conjugated with as03 adjuvant system ( a squalene_based immunogenic adju_ vant instigating unique immunol ogical profile within the vac__cine on the basis of the immunolo gical duration and strength ) , the microneedle array ( mna ) _b ased recombinant immunogen_ ic vaccine , and the multi_antigenic ( triple antigen ) virus_like particle ( vlp ) vaccines are significant for the enrolment to the clinical_trials [ 3 ] . the viral vectored vaccines include the recombinant , replication_defective adenovirus type_5 vector ( ad5 ) _ncov which can express the recombinant s protein , the lv_smenp_dc vaccine ( whic h can activate the host cyto_ toxic t cells against sars_cov_2 ) , and the chadox1 vaccine ( discussed in the succeeding tex t ) . the live attenuated vaccine ( lav ) known as the delns1_sars_cov_2_rbd is also sig_ nificant which can express the receptor_binding domain ( rbd ) domain of sars_cov_2 spike_protein [ 3 ] . indeed , the different categories of covid_19 vaccines have been elaborately discussed in several reports [ 3,6,7,10–12 ] . in this review , the promising candidates which may be commercially applied for the quick mitigation of the disease are deliberated . for example , the viral vectored vaccine s may instigate the elevation of cytotoxic t cells ( ctl ) which in turn eliminate the infecting sars_cov_2 particles , and hence , such vaccines are significant for prophylactic use [ 3 ] . the recombinant nonreplicating adenovi_ rus type_5 ( ad5 ) _vectored vaccine has been reported to undergo the first randomized controlled trial ( currently in phase ii ) in wuhan , china [ 6,7 ] . the outcome was that the administration of 5 × 1010viral particles appeared to induce the required host immunity together with safety [ 7 ] . the humoral and cellular im_ munity has been noticed to be triggered in the participants by the chimpanzee adenovirus vector vaccine , chadox1_ncov_19 ( azd1222 ) , expressing the sars_cov_2 spike_protein ( fig . 1 ) , which underwent a phase i/ii , single_blind , randomized controlled trial nct04324606 in the uk , and was found to be safe and immunogenic with mild reactogenicity [ 6,10 ] . the instigation of ( 1 ) cellular immunity by enumerat ing the antigen_specific t cells and ( 2 ) the humoral responses noticed through the elicitation of igg were assessed by the standard serological techniques as de_ scribed by several groups [ 6,7,10 ] . another promising vaccine developed in russia ( phase_iii clinical_trial ) , the gam_covid_ vac_lyo vaccine , has been authorized for emergency use [ 6 ] . however , the dna_ and rna_based approaches possess the greatest potential f or escalating the development of effective179 curr clin micro rpt ( 2021 ) 8:178–185 vaccines in the current dreadful situation caused by the sars__cov_2 [ 11,12 ] . a glimpse of these most prospective vaccines is given in the succeeding text . mrna vaccines this is to be noted in the current pandemic situation that the us food and drug administration ( usfda ) approved the use of the pfizer_biontech ( bnt162b2 vaccine ) and moderna vac__cine ( mrna_1273 vaccine ) , both of which are the mrna vac__cines ( whereby the sars_cov_2 spike glycoprotein ( s ) anti_ gen is encoded by the mrna and then devised in the lipid nanoparticles or the lnps ) with more than 90 % effectiveness in candidates 16 years_of_age or older with 2 days within 21 days [ 13–15 ] . descriptively , the mrna_1273 vaccine ( where_ by the mrna encoding the s_2p antigen , containing the sars_cov_2 glycoprotein attached to a transmembrane an_ chor , and an intact s1 –s2 cleavage site , and is enclosed by a_4 subunit lipid nanoparticle ) which has undergone the first_in_ human dose_dependent ( 25 or 30 , 100 , and 250 μg ) , open_label phase ii clinical tria l nct04283461 ( with th e fast_track approv_ al from the usfda as stated above ) successfully detected the elevated neutralizing_antibody titers and the required t cell responses [ 3,6,11,13 ] . a unique characteristic of this vaccine is that this one is free from any preservative [ 12 ] . this is also notable that in the current phase_iii trial , around 44,000 partic_ ipants are being subjected for th e evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the mrna_1273 ( moderna tx , inc. ) vaccine , and the outcome is_95 % satisfactory so far [ 13 ] .how does mrna_1273 vaccine work ? the chemistry of the mrna_1273 ( moderna tx , inc. ) vac__cine is based on the contentment of ( 1 ) the nucleoside_ modified messenger_rna ( modrna ) , i.e. , the mrna ( as stated earlier ) as the active_ingredient that encodes the viral spike glycoprotein ( s ) of sars_cov_2 ( i.e. , rna serves as the template to generate the specific protein that triggers the host immune response against the virus ) ; ( 2 ) lipid nanoparti_ cles ( lnps ) with complexed polyethylene glycol ( peg ) , phosphocholine , and cholesterol ( this is to be noted here that biontech_pfizer and moderna encapsulate their mrna vac__cines within lnps which aids in the delivery of the rna and protects the rna from degradation ) ; ( 3 ) salts including potas_ sium chloride and sodium chloride , and monobasic potassium phosphate and the dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate which serve as the buffer ; and ( 4 ) sucrose , which acts as the cryopro_ tectant assuring that the lipid does not get too much sticky at the extremely cold temperature during storage [ 13 ] . the de_ velopment procedure of the mrna_1273 vaccine has been very well described by corbett et al . [ 14 ] . briefly , a dna fragment consisting of the immunogen open_reading_frame ( orf ) flanked by 5 ′untranslated region ( 5 ′utr ) and the 3 ′ utr is used as a template on which the t7 rna polymerase mediates transcription to generate the mrna encoding sars__cov_2 s ( 2p ) protein ( fig . 2 ) , followed by the enzymatic addition of the cap structure and the subsequent purification of the mrna . for encapsulation of the preclinical mrna into the lnps , the modified ethanol_drop nanoprecipitation pro_ cess is applied whereby pegs are mixed with the mrna fig . 1 scheme of developing the chadox1 recombinant adenovirus vaccine ( adapted from the description reported by kaur and gupta ) [ 3 ] 180 curr clin micro rpt ( 2021 ) 8:178–185 ( maintaining ph at 5.0 in the acetate buffer ) , neutralized , and finally , sucrose is added as a cryoprotectant as stated above , and the final_solution is filter sterilized [ 15,16 ] . prior to use , vials filled with the formulated lnp are stored in –70 °c , and before the in vivo application , the product is assessed for a range of variables as described recently [ 14 ] . the mers_cov s_2p and the sars_cov s_2p proteins are expressed by the transfection of plasmids into expi293 cells following the protein purification [ 14,15 ] . as described by corbett et al. , the mammalian expression vector derived from plexm is used whereby a mammalian codon_optimized plasmid encoding foldon inserted minifibritin with a c_terminal thrombin cleavage site is inserted following the expression of the construct by transient transfection of expi293 [ 14 ] . in addition to the hek293t/17 cells ( transiently transfected with the mrna that encodes the sars_cov_2 s or 2p protein ) and the ace2_expressing 293t cell cultivation , the vero e6 cells , in the plaque reduc_ tion neutralization test ( prnt ) , are used in plaque assays to detect the lung and nasal turbinate viral titers [ 14 ] .effectiveness of the pfizer_biontech and moderna mrna vaccines indeed , still , there are many unknowns regarding the sars__cov_2 which are resisting to encounter the ongoing disastrous pandemic even the preventive measures suggested by the world_health_organization ( who ) are being followed more or less all over the world . apparently , the situation appears as an irresistible state , and the su ppression of the covid_19 trans_ mission seems to be possible only when the herd_immunity ( i.e. , the resistance against the viral spread within a population and a sufficient population may trigger the protective immunity against sars_cov_2 thereby reducing the probability of trans_ mission between both the infecte d and susceptible individuals ) will develop [ 17,18 ] . actually , until and unless any suitable vaccine is prepared , there will not be any improvement of the current pandemic situation . so fa r , nearly thirty 30 pharmaceu_ tical companies and research ins titutes/academi c organizations around the world have been engaged in developing the accurate vaccine against covid_19 ; among them , pfizer_biontech and moderna appeared as the most successful in constructing vaccines using nanotechnology with the mrna platform , and fig . 2 a model showing the scheme of the mechanisms of action of the mrna_1273 vaccine ( adapted from the description reported by corbett et al . ) [ 11 ] . details are described in the text . briefly , following transfection and endocytosis , the mrna is translated within the host tomake sars_cov_2 s protein , which is released and also undergoes the mhc class i processing for the antigenic presentation on the host_cell surface . the exogenous protein undergoes endocytosis followed by processing by mhc class ii181 curr clin micro rpt ( 2021 ) 8:178–185 those under_trial vaccines ( as s tated above ) have already shown required immunogenicity and safety according to the clinical_trials [ 17 ] . the clinical_trials conducted by moderna reached the successful production of mrna_1273 vaccine within a very short time ( around 2 months ) which can be compared with the previous sars_cov_1 and me rs_cov clinical_trials re_ quiring around 2 years in both cases [ 17 ] . biontech/pfizer , another leading pharmaceutical com_ pany , developed the sars_cov_2 vaccine ( namely , bnt162b1 ) as stated previously which is actually a lipid_ nanoparticle_formulated ( fig . 2 ) , nucleoside_modified mrna vaccine encoding the receptor_binding domain ( rbd ) of the s protein of the virus . the vaccine is also currently under the dose_dependent ( 10 , 30 , or 100 μg ) clinical_trial ( clinicaltrials.gov identifier nct04368728 ) , and the outcome seems to be satisfactory as the rbd_ binding igg concentrations and the sars_cov_2 neutral_ izing antibody titers in sera were noticed to be elevated [ 13 , 18 ] . however , despite such fast progress by pfizer_ biontech and moderna , some adverse_effects of the vac_ cination in the trial stage have been noticed as the onset of fatigue , headache , muscle and joint pains , chills , fever , and , in some cases of the participants , the lymphadenopathy [ 13 ] . however , the high reported efficacy of the mrna_ 1273 vaccine is supported by the trial assay sensitivity w h i c hi nt u r ni na s s o c i a t i o nt o the industrial manufacturing ( safe mrna –lnp commercial mrna vaccine delivery platform as shown in fig . 2 ) of the established vaccine with required logistics and thereby facilitating a quick response to the current pandemic [ 14 ] . dna vaccine the dna vaccine , which induces both humoral and cell_ mediated immunity , is made on the principle that the genetic material of the sars_cov_2 is translocated ( the antigen_ presenting cells or apcs receive the genetic material ) to the host ’ s cell nucleus so that the mammalian promoter present in the plasmid vector is activated , triggering the transcription and translation of the transfected gene ( s ) within the host [ 12 ] . the resulting vaccine antigenic protein can then be presented to the apcs ( mainly the dcs ) through the mhc signaling : ( 1 ) the cd8+t cell immunity is induced by the myocytes ( mhc i signaling ) which in turn stimulates the excretion of interferon ( ifn ) _ γand the tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) _ α , and thus , the viral replication inside the host is hindered ( fig . 3 ) a n d ( 2 ) t h e cd4+helper t cells are activated by macrophages ( mhc ii signaling ) , and the dcs ( mhc ii signaling ) activate the cd8+ t cells by triggering the production of interleukin ( il ) _10 , il_ 12 , and the tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) _ α , and the cd4+ helper t cells are activated by these dcs ( fig . 3 ) w h e nt h e y produce il_4 [ 12,16,19 ] . this is to be mentioned that bamhi xhoi fig . 3 a model showing the induction of cellular and humoral immunity with the action of the dna vaccine ino_4800 ( adapted from the description reported by silveira et al . ) [ 12 ] . details are given in the text182 curr clin micro rpt ( 2021 ) 8:178–185 myocytes have been evidently the predominant transfected cell type triggering the potential cell_mediated immunity [ 20 ] . the antigen transfer from myocytes to the professional apcs is thus significant for the induction of the cytotoxic t cells through the administration of dna vaccines [ 20 ] . the vaccine protein serves as the target for the recognition by the b cell receptor , and the activated b cells may produce principally igg [ 12 ] . ino_4800 , which is now under the phase i clinical_trial ( nct04336410 ) , is a prophylactic dna vac__cine ( fig . 3 ) which is prepared on the basis of the codon_ optimized s protein sequence ( synthesized and digested using bamhi and xhoi ) of the virus to which an ige leader se_ quence is affixed and the digested dna is incorporated into the expression plasmid pgx0001 which in turn elicits the production of s protein reactive ( both s1 and s2 ) and the rbd_binding igg and the t cell responses [ 3,21 ] . comparative efficacy between the dna and rna vaccines and the commencement of rnai therapy and crispr_cas13_based antiviral strategy considering the instability of mrna and its immunostimulatory nature ( as an agonist of the toll_like receptor , tlr3 ) , dna vaccines may apparently be prefer_ able ; however , using pseudouridine instead of uridine may generate the stable form of mrna which is really effective in the simultaneous translation of the sars_cov_2 s pro_ tein together with decreased immunogenicity upon admin_ istration within the lnps into the host [ 13,22 ] . in addition , compared to the plasmid dna vaccines , whose entry into the host nucleus is obvious or necessary to produce mrnas , the administration of mrna vaccines easily per_ mits the mrna directly to be placed in the cytoplasm there_ by increasing the translation frequency [ 22 ] . however , based upon the chemistry and the mode of action of these two types of vaccines , the optimal and intentional delivery with precise formulations of either the dna vaccine or the mrna vaccine may bring about the similar benefits to the patients . interestingly , in order to mitigate the covid_19 pandemic , besides the ongoing efforts including the vacci_ nation strategies , convalescent plasma therapy , intravenous_immunoglobulin ( ivig ) infusi on therapy ; application of ace_2 inhibitors and the angiotensin 1 receptor ( at1r ) , hindering the hace2_sars_cov_2_rbd interaction by the usage of monoclonal antibodies ; sars_cov rna_de_ pendent rna polymerase ( rdrp ) targeting drugs , repositioned antivirals and the immunomodulatory agents ; the rna interference ( rnai ) therapy has also got attention especially if the inadvertent mrna or the dna vaccination outcome arises [ 23 ] . as elaborately discussed by sarwar et al. , due to the rnai_provoked silencing , ( 1 ) the sars_cov_2 nonstructural protein 15 ( nsp15 ) imparting the anti_ apoptosis trait , ( 2 ) the orf_3a and orf_4a ( responsible for the viral release within the infected individual ) , and ( 3 ) the orf_9b ( the ifn agonist ) may become the possible targets of the rnai therapy , and hence , the viral life cycle within the host can be blocked [ 23 ] . besides , three noncoding micrornas ( mir_1246 ) , which can act as the rnai_tar_ gets , have been noticed to curb the expression of ace_2 [ 23 ] . another antiviral strategy can be the employment of the crispr_cas13_based strategy across the human respi_ ratory tract whereby the prophylactic antiviral crispr ( pac_man ) can hinder the viral replication and release by degrading the viral rna [ 23,24 ] . crispr rnas ( crrnas ) can target the sars_cov_2 conserved genomic regions , and a bioinformatic analysis by abbott et al . showed that a group of only six crrnas were more than 90 % effective as anti_sars _cov_2 agents even though the synthesized fragments were used [ 24 ] . however , it is speculated that the rnai therapy or the crispr_based therapy would be useful if new mutations arise in the viral spike protein_encoding genomes ( already 15 amino_acid variations have been observed in the rbd of the mutant sars_cov_2 ) which may render the mrna vaccines or the dna vaccines inactive against the new strains of sars_cov_2 [ 25,26 ] . extensive clinical_trials using these two new approaches would be required to prove such an assumption though . conclusion several research teams have been engrossed although 2020 in dissecting innumerable antiviral drugs for their usefulness and doing the best for developing diverse forms of vaccines through a number of clinical_trials with notable success imparting long_term immunity against sars_co_v . besides the nearly successful mrna_1273 vaccine which is expected to be launched commercially for the mitigation of the covid_ 19 pandemic by 2021 , still there are requirements for the de_ velopment of other successful and licensed vaccines with sat_ isfactory clinical_trials regarding vaccine efficacy , safety , and justified logistics . a sound and flawless platform of clinical_trials imparting the nonbiased data on the vaccine efficacy together with a comparative valuation of the accredited vac__cines would open up the quick and the finest way to develop new vaccines against sars_cov_2 . however , one point is to ponder that viruses can mutate , and if a large_scale mutation occurs within the spike_protein of the viral inoculum within the vaccine , it would not trigger the cellular or humoral im_ mune response in the host . hence , regular analysis of the genome sequences is another necessary part not only in course of vaccine development phases but also to maintain vaccine sustainability . moreover , due to the evidence of the rising183 curr clin micro rpt ( 2021 ) 8:178–185 variants of sars_cov_2 , replacing the current vaccine ’ ss protein with the renovated molecule with the required changes in the specific amino_acid ( with a concomitant observation of the host protective immunity against the new version of the vaccine ) or by adding the new molecule to the existing formu_ lation ( i.e. , forming the multivalent vaccine ) would be a choice to effectively combat the upcoming sars_cov_2 in_ fection . following the current clinical_trials , if the current vac__cine does not seem to be effective against the new variants , the formulation and implementation of the seasonal vaccine may be required . author contribution rn : conceptualization ; literature survey ; formal analysis ; investigation ; resources ;

frontrunners in late_stage clinical_trials to ﬁght the covid_19 pandemic , challenges surrounding their formulation and stability became readily apparent . in this commentary , we ﬁrst describe company proposals , based on available public information , for the ( frozen ) storage of mrna vaccine drug products across the vaccine supply_chain . we then review the literature on the pharma_ceutical stability of mrna vaccine candidates , including attempts to improve their stability , analytical techniques to monitor their stability , and regulatory guidelines covering product characterization and storage stability . we conclude that systematic approaches to identify the key physicochemical degra_dation mechanism ( s ) of formulated mrna vaccine candidates are currently lacking . rational design of optimally stabilized mrna vaccine formulations during storage , transport , and administration at refrigerated or ambient temperatures should thus have top priority in the pharmaceutical developmentcommunity . in addition to evidence of human immunogenicity against multiple viral pathogens , including compelling ef_ﬁcacy results against covid_19 , another key strength of the mrna vaccine approach is that it is readily adaptable to rapidly address future outbreaks of new emerging infectious_diseases . consequently , we should not wait for the next pandemic to address and solve the challengesassociated with the stability and storage of formulated mrna vaccines . ©2020 published by elsevier inc. on behalf of the american pharmacists association . this is an

mostly focused on treatment or protection of small groups of recipients , were in progress in january 2020 at the time of the outbreak of the covid_19 pandemic . this situation dramatically changed in the ﬁrst months of 2020 , when mrna vaccines ‘ overnight ’ became covid_19 vaccine candidates and a global pandemic had to be tackled as fast as possible . currently , three non_replicating mrna vaccine candidates against covid_19 are being tested in human clinical_trials , i.e. , sponsored by mod_ erna , p ﬁzer_biontech , and curevac.1many more mrna vaccine candidates are being evaluated in preclinical studies.2theﬁrst re_ sults from large_scale , phase 3 clinical_trials for the moderna andpﬁzer_biontech vaccines have been reported as very promising with high ef_ﬁcacy rates ( ~95 % ) . moreover , no clinical holds due to unacceptable adverse_effects have been encountered so far . as of the writing of this commentary , one mrna_based covid_ 19 vaccine ( from p ﬁzer_biontech ) has received conditional approval by the british mhra ( medicines_and_healthcare_products_regulatory_agency ) and more regulatory bodies are expected to follow soon.3considering the potential of the mrna vaccine approach to control or even stop the pandemic , a rolling review approach has been adopted by regulatory authorities such as fda ( us food and drug administration ) and ema ( european medicines agency ) to ensure both a rigorous and rapid review and approval process.4when approved , an enormous number of mrna vaccine doses will need to be manufactured , shipped across the globe , stored at end_user sites , and then administered in large_scale vaccination campaigns . before the covid_19 pandemic , the stor_ age temperature of mrna vaccine candidates in development had not been given much attention . typically , small batches were kept frozen at /c080/c14c , and then thawed and administered as needed . along with the growing clinical promise of mrna_based covid_19 *

however , there arose a growing perception that storage , transport and delivery under these conditions would create quite a challenge when hundreds of millions ( eventually billions ) of doses were to be administered all around the world.5,6 in this commentary , we describe the current proposals ( based on publicly available company information ) for the storage of mrna covid_19 vaccines across different stages of the supply_chain including in_use_stability conditions . this is followed by an overview of the literature of what is known about the stability of mrna vaccines , especially the ﬁnal drug product . we then discuss attempts made to improve their stability during storage , analytical_methods to monitor their stability , and international regulatory guidelines for stability testing . finally , we summarize our current knowledge base and identify outstanding challenges and oppor_ tunities with regard to improving the stability pro ﬁle ( and assess_ ments ) of formulated mrna vaccines . description of the mrna covid_19 vaccines being tested in the clinic historical perspective the ( short ) history of the development of the concept of using mrna vaccines for prophylactic or therapeutic indications has beenexpertly summarized . 7e9in these reviews , the special character of mrna macromolecules consisting of approximately 1000 e5000 nucleotides is discussed , and various strategies to modify ‘ natural ’ mrna molecules to make them more resistant to enzymatic and non_enzymatic degradation are explained along with different approaches to decrease potential innate immune reactions . more_ over , pogocki and sch €oneich provide comprehensive insights into the chemical degradation reactions that mrna molecules can un_ dergo , including hydrolysis of n_glycosidic bonds ( depurination ) , hydrolysis of phospho_diester bonds , deamination of cytosine de_ rivatives and oxidation of nucleobases or sugar moieties.10reaction kinetics not only depend on the solution environment ( e.g. , ph , buffers , presence of oxygen ) but also on secondary structure for_ mation of the mrna molecule in solution as well as in the presence of cationic lipids ( see below ) .11,12it is important to recognize that the complete , intact mrna molecule is essential to its potency as a vaccine . even a minor degradation reaction , anywhere along a mrna strand , can severely slow or stop proper translation perfor_ mance of that strand and thus result in the incomplete expression of the target antigen . in contrast , therapeutic proteins and protein antigens may undergo multiple chemical degradation reactions ( e.g. , asn deamidation , met oxidation ) which , if they occur outside the active_site or an important epitope , do not necessarily affect potency . particular attention must be paid to the critical issue of deliv_ ering mrna inside cells and the essential contribution of formu_ lation using various delivery vehicles.13e15for example , lipids ( as in lipid nanoparticles , lnp ) and proteins ( e.g. , protamine , a naturally_ occurring basic/cationic polymer ) are used to enhance intracellular mrna delivery . these critical components of a formulated mrnavaccine modulate mrna distribution in the body , help mrna molecules enter cells , and affect protein antigen expression and immunogenicity as well as the safety pro ﬁle.14,16moreover , they likely impact mrna stability during storage . for example , in a theoretical study , wayment_steele et al . predict a hundred_fold increase in cleavage rate of mrna when it is incorporated in a cationic lipid formulation.12based on these considerations , the nature , quality and supplier of these excipients , along with the design of the formulation manufacturing processes , may affect the pharmaceutical stability of formulated mrna vaccine candidates in terms of chemical stability of the mrna/excipients as well as the colloidal stability of their complexes . a reliable supply_chain of the raw materials is therefore of great importance to assure consistent quality of the vaccine product , which can be challenging in times of a pandemic as was recently experienced by pﬁzer_biontech.17 storage conditions for covid_19 mrna vaccines : current situation available information on the stability pro ﬁles of the mrna covid_19 vaccine candidates in development is regularly updated . the current shelf_life and temperature storage conditions pub_ lished by three vaccine manufacturers ( i.e. , moderna , p ﬁzer_ biontech and curevac ) are listed in table 1 . at this time ( december 5 , 2020 ) , such information has been provided by the vaccine manufacturers only , with no con ﬁrmation from regulatory authorities . it is now clear , however , that the required storage conditions during manufacturing , shipping and at the end_user site are considered important characteristics of the mrna vaccine drug product , as they might offer a competitive ( dis ) advantage . stability data of mrna vaccines in the literature : a rare commodity there is a wealth of information on stabilizing mrna molecules themselves , as expertly reviewed.8,9,18in contrast , when searching the literature for stability and storage of formulated mrna drug product stability ( i.e. , lnp_mrna and protein_mrna complexes ) , little information can be retrieved as of the time of this writing . in a review by muradlihara et al. , on nucleic_acid based macromole_ cules ( nam ) , including but not restricted to mrna vaccines , the authors draw a similar conclusion : ‘ there is a need for a compre_ hensive overview of all the challenges and mitigation strategies for naked nam stability and formulation in nonviral systems . ‘ 19that need is even more urgent now , considering the emerging impor_ tance of mrna vaccines in ﬁghting the global covid_19 pandemic . in terms of mrna drug product stability studies , a few reports with lyophilized mrna formulations have appeared . for example , a study on the effect of freeze_drying on the integrity of naked mrna showed that a trehalose solution performed better than distilled_water.20in a later publication , a mrna_protamine vaccine candi_ date against rabies was freeze_dried and tested in mice . the dried formulation was stored at temperatures ranging from /c080 toþ70/c14c . under the chosen read_out conditions ( 1 vaccine dose table 1

45/c14cg a v e adequate neutralizing_antibody levels and protected mice from a rabies infection . even after stressed storage at þ70/c14c for 3 months , protection of the mice was observed . unfortunately , the study does not give details about the formulation or about physicochemical quality_attributes before and after lyophilization and storage.21in a series of patents from curevac , claims are made to maintenance of the activity of mrna formulations ( with and without protamine ) upon freeze_drying and storage by using lyoprotectants such as sugars.22e24for example , ketterer et al . used trehalose as a lyo_ protectant to stabilize mrna_protamine complex formulations during freeze_drying and storage at /c080 , 5 , 25 and 40/c14c.24stability analysis included appearance , rna integrity , rna content , ph value , and osmolality , and the text states : ‘ the results show that all quality_attributes analyzed during the experimental period ( up to 36 months ) meet the stability speci ﬁcations of a stable and safe rna medicament . ’ however , no justi ﬁcation for such stability speci ﬁcations were given . other patent publications describe spray_drying of mrna25or the generation of lyospheres , i.e. , freeze_ dried droplets with mrna.26in 2020 , zhao et al . published their ﬁndings on the performance of freeze_dried lnp_mrna ( encoding for luciferase ) with different lyoprotectants compared to fresh lnps.27they examined both in vitro and in vivo mrna expression ( single_dose , i.v . injection ) in mice . these reports , scattered throughout the ( patent ) literature , lack a mechanistic basis . clearly , the speed at which mrna vaccine candidates have recently been developed has prioritized optimization of in vivo delivery , in vivo expression , and animal immunogenicity and safety results over storage stability , which now places critical limitations on future , large_scale mrna vaccine deployment . regulatory guidelines in june of 2020 , the fda published a ‘ guidance for the devel_ opment and licensure of vaccines to prevent covid_19 ‘ ( thus , not only mrna vaccines ) , which contains paragraphs on ‘ chemistry , manufacturing and controls ’ ( cmc ) .28the following quotes are taken from this guidance document : ‘ data on the quali ﬁcation/ validation for all quality indicating assays should be submitted for a bla ’ ( biologics license application ) … . . and ‘ for vaccine licensure , the stability and expiry date of the vaccine in its ﬁnal container , when maintained at the recommended storage temperature , should be demonstrated using ﬁnal containers from at least three ﬁnal lots made from different vaccine bulks . ’ naik and pesen , from the fda of ﬁce of vaccines research , provide more detailed insights into the current thinking within the fda regarding cmc issues of mrna vaccines.29speci ﬁc ich ( international council for harmo_ nisation of technical requirements for pharmaceuticals for humanuse ) or fda guidances for mrna_based vaccines have yet to be developed , and no examples of speci_ﬁc release and/or stability acceptance criteria for quality_attributes are in the public domain . the regulatory pathway in the eu for mrna vaccines against infectious_diseases is described by hinz et al.30the ema considers mrna vaccines for infectious_diseases as a class of medicines known as biological medicinal products . these products fall under the re_ sponsibility of the committee for human medicinal products ( chmp ) and follow the centralized procedure to obtain marketing approval through ema . schmid summarizes the quality data needed for an eu investigational medicinal product dossier ( impd ) , which is part of the clinical_trial application ( cta ) .31the latter is similar to the usa investigational new drug ( ind ) application . the impd contains information on the mrna molecule itself as well as degradation products ( i.e. , product impurities ) and process impurities such as residual dna , proteins and solvents from the manufacturing process . the next section of the impd deals with the control of the drug substance with information on analytical procedures and their acceptance criteria ( i.e. , speci ﬁcations ) . finally , data on critical mrna product stability parameters is requested where stability_indicating parameters for the mrna component are : mrna integrity , contentand potency as well as pharmaceutical properties including ph , appearance , and the microbiological status of the drug product . details on speci ﬁcations and stability testing for a biological bulk drug substance and ﬁnal drug product can be found in the ich q6b and ich q5c guidelines , respectively . at the end of their chapter , hinz et al . provide an exemplary list with analytical tests for a liquid mrna_based drug substance and a freeze_dried drug product without giving corresponding acceptance criteria . 30in the next section , we brie ﬂy discuss key analytical techniques for mrna ( vaccine drug product ) testing and characterization . the analytical toolbox the qualitative composition of two mrna covid_19 vaccine candidates formulated as mrna_lnps is shown in table 2 . the analysis of the identity , purity , potency , safety and stability of the mrna bioactive and the mrna_lipid/protein complex formulations is obtained through a series of analytical_methods . poveda et al . reviewed key techniques currently available to monitor the critical quality_attributes of mrna vaccine candidates ( table 3 ) .32we expanded the list by including additional assays to characterize attributes related to formulated ( i.e. , lipid_ and/or protein_ containing ) mrna drug products including general quality attri_ butes for parenterally administered vaccines.19,33unfortunately , a critical review on analytical techniques to characterize mrna_ ( cationic ) lipid complexes , as has been published previously for plasmid dna_lipid complexes,34is clearly missing . table 2 qualitative composition of mrna covid_19 vaccine candidates formulated as mrna_lipid nanoparticles ( lnps ) a . category p ﬁzer_biontech vaccine candidate moderna vaccine

study protocol.43d.j.a . crommelin et al . / journal of pharmaceutical sciences 110 ( 2021 ) 997_1001 999 in summary , mrna based product candidates for several ther_ apeutic and prophylactic indications have been tested in the clinic and numerous publications have reported on the nature of the mrna drug product involved . nonetheless , key cmc information on the critical quality_attributes and corresponding justi ﬁcation of acceptance criteria , especially as related to determining the sta_ bility pro ﬁle of formulated mrna drug products ( i.e. , shelf_life and storage temperature ) , has yet to reach the public domain . concluding considerations the mrna vaccine candidates from p ﬁzer_biontech and mod_ erna are promising frontrunners for protection against the covid_ 19 pandemic . although detailed ef_ﬁcacy and safety information from the clinical_trials as well as required storage conditions are shared with the public through publications in peer_reviewed journals and company press releases , no background information on the quality_attributes that control and limit stability is available . for example , what are the assay capabilities and acceptance criteria for the relevant quality_attributes for the proposed storage condi_ tions for mrna vaccines ( table 1 ) ? in this context , the extended controlled temperature chain ( ectc ) initiative of the world_health_organization ( who ) is worth mentioning.35in this case , it would potentially allow a mrna vaccine to be kept at temperatures outside of the frozen cold_chain ( e.g. , 2 e8/c14c for a limited period of time ) under monitored and controlled conditions . while the present mrna vaccine formulations in late_stage covid_19 clinical_trials may already be ﬁnalized in terms of composition , there is presumably room for subsequent , “ second generation ” formulations with stability improvements . for example , alternative excipient choices to develop improved , refrigerated stable mrna vaccine formulations , e.g. , as either liquid or lyophilized products , could be pursued . from the above discus_ sion , one can see that stability assessments of mrna vaccine can_ didates are in their infancy with only scattered reports currently in the literature . a systematic , mechanism_based approach looking into chemical and physical degradation pathways is lacking . taking a more rational approach to the design of new formulations to ensure stability of mrna vaccine ﬁnal drug products shouldtherefore have top priority in the pharmaceutical community . such formulation development studies including the selection of excip_ ients ( e.g. , stabilizers and/or the inclusion of preservatives ) , formulation milieu ( e.g. , ph and tonicifying agents ) , and manufacturing processes ( e.g. , liquid or lyophilized dosage forms ) should be part of an integrated effort to move away from freezing conditions for long_term_storage . to this end , the inherent stability of the active mrna molecule should be optimized without compromising its potency . the lnp ( consisting of mrna and lipids ; cf.table 2 ) composition and structure are critical to in vivo delivery , protein antigen generation , and subsequent immunogenicity and vaccine safety . therefore , in vivo testing should be part of this development program for second generation mrna vaccine for_ mulations , as optimization of shelf_life and storage temperatures should not interfere with presently established in vivo performance . finally , as mrna vaccines take a prominent place in global strategies to successfully ﬁght the covid_19 pandemic , we believe it is short_sighted and unwise to wait for another pandemic before solving the storage stability issues of this versatile , rapidly_ deployable vaccine platform technology . instead , a better under_ standing of the causes and mechanisms of the instability of mrna vaccine formulations , combined with rational selection of appro_ priate stabilization technologies , will undoubtedly lead to im_ provements in mrna vaccine stability . such second generation mrna vaccine formulations with optimized stability , i.e. , enabling shipping and storage at refrigerated or ambient temperatures across the entire vaccine supply_chain , should be developed now to facilitate more rapid worldwide distribution of mrna vaccines in the future . references 1 . hrabovszki g. treatments and vaccines for covid_19 . https : //www.ema . europa.eu/en/human_regulatory/overview/public_health_threats/coronavirus_

commentwww.thelancet.com/microbe vol 2 july 2021 e279covid_19 vaccine efficacy and effectiveness—the elephant ( not ) in the room approximately 96 covid_19 vaccines are at various stages of clinical development.1 at present , we have the interim results of four studies published in scientific_journals ( on the pfizer–biontech bnt162b2 mrna vaccine , 2 the moderna–us national_institutes_of_health [ nih ] mrna_1273 vaccine,3 the astrazeneca– oxford chadox1_ncov_19 vaccine,4 and the gamaleya gamcovidvac [ sputnik v ] vaccine ) 5 and three studies through the us food and drug administration ( fda ) briefing documents ( on the pfizer–biontech , 6 moderna–nih,7 and johnson_&_johnson [ j & j ] ad26 . cov2.s vaccines ) .8 furthermore , excerpts of these results have been widely communicated and debated through press releases and media , sometimes in misleading ways . 9 although attention has focused on vaccine efficacy and comparing the reduction of the number of symptomatic cases , fully understanding the efficacy and effectiveness of vaccines is less straightforward than it might seem . depending on how the effect_size is expressed , a quite different picture might emerge ( figure ; appendix ) . vaccine efficacy is generally reported as a relative_risk reduction ( rrr ) . it uses the relative_risk ( rr ) —ie , the ratio of attack rates with and without a vaccine—which is expressed as 1–rr . ranking by reported efficacy gives relative_risk reductions of 95 % for the pfizer–biontech , 94 % for the moderna–nih , 91 % for the gamaleya , 67 % for the j & j , and 67 % for the astrazeneca–oxford vaccines . however , rrr should be seen against the background risk of being infected and becoming ill with covid_19 , which varies between populations and over time . although the rrr considers only participants who could benefit from the vaccine , the absolute risk reduction ( arr ) , which is the difference between attack rates with and without a vaccine , considers the whole population . arrs tend to be ignored because they give a much less impressive effect_size than rrrs : 1·3 % for the astrazeneca–oxford , 1·2 % for the moderna–nih , 1·2 % for the j & j , 0·93 % for the gamaleya , and 0·84 % for the pfizer–biontech vaccines . arr is also used to derive an estimate of vaccine effectiveness , which is the number needed to vaccinate ( nnv ) to prevent one more case of covid_19 as 1/arr . nnvs bring a different perspective : 81 for the moderna–nih , 78 for the astrazeneca–oxford , 108 for the gamaleya , 84 for the j & j , and 119 for the pfizer–biontech vaccines . the explanation lies in the combination of vaccine efficacy and different background risks of covid_19 across studies : 0·9 % for the pfizer–biontech , 1 % for the gamaleya , 1·4 % for the moderna–nih , 1·8 % for the j & j , and 1·9 % for the astrazeneca–oxford vaccines . arr ( and nnv ) are sensitive to background risk— the higher the risk , the higher the effectiveness—as exemplified by the analyses of the j & j ’ s vaccine on centrally confirmed cases compared with all cases : 8 both the numerator and denominator change , rrr does not change ( 66–67 % ) , but the one_third increase in attack rates in the unvaccinated group ( from 1 ·8 % to 2· 4 % ) translates in a one_fourth decrease in nnv ( from 84 to 64 ) . see online for appendix figure : rrr and nnv with 95 % ci ranked by attack rate in the unvaccinated ( placebo ) group for five covid_19 vaccinesthe lower the nnv and the higher the rrr , the better the vaccine efficacy . details are in the appendix ( p 3 ) .

first appeared at thelancet.com/microbe on june 11 , 2021 commente280 www.thelancet.com/microbe vol 2 july 2021there are many lessons to learn from the way studies are conducted and results are presented . with the use of only rrrs , and omitting arrs , reporting bias is introduced , which affects the interpretation of vaccine efficacy . 10 when communicating about vaccine efficacy , especially for public health decisions such as choosing the type of vaccines to purchase and deploy , having a full picture of what the data actually show is important , and ensuring comparisons are based on the combined evidence that puts vaccine trial results in context and not just looking at one summary measure , is also important . such decisions should be properly informed by detailed understanding of study results , requiring access to full datasets and independent scrutiny and analyses . unfortunately , comparing vaccines on the basis of currently available trial ( interim ) data is made even more difficult by disparate study protocols , including primary endpoints ( such as what is considered a covid_19 case , and when is this assessed ) , types of placebo , study populations , background risks of covid_19 during the study , duration of exposure , and different definitions of populations for analyses both within and between studies , as well as definitions of endpoints and statistical_methods for efficacy . importantly , we are left with the unanswered question as to whether a vaccine with a given efficacy in the study population will have the same efficacy in another population with different levels of background risk of covid_19 . this is not a trivial question because transmission intensity varies between countries , affected by factors such as public health interventions and virus variants . the only reported indication of vaccine effectiveness is the israeli mass vaccination campaign using the pfizer–biontech product . although the design and methodology are radically different from the randomised trial , 2 dagan and colleagues11 report an rrr of 94 % , which is essentially the same as the rrr of the phase 3 trial ( 95 % ) but with an arr of 0·46 % , which translates into an nnv of 217 ( when the arr was 0·84 % and the nnv was 119 in the phase 3 trial ) . this means in a real_life setting , 1·8 times more subjects might need to be vaccinated to prevent one more case of covid_19 than predicted in the corresponding clinical_trial . uncoordinated phase 3 trials do not satisfy public health requirements ; platform trials designed to address public health relevant questions with a common protocol will allow decisions to be made , informed by common_criteria and uniform assessment . these considerations on efficacy and effectiveness are based on studies measuring prevention of mild to moderate covid_19 infection ; they were not designed to conclude on prevention of hospitalisation , severe_disease , or death , or on prevention of infection and transmission potential . assessing the suitability of vaccines must consider all indicators , and involve safety , deployability , availability , and costs . we declare no

covid_19 pandemic . as we transition to endemicity , inequitable access to vaccines , and particularly in low_ and middle_income_countries ( lmics ) , still poses risks of unprecedented disruptions and the emergence of viral mutations , which potentially lead to notorious vaccine_resistant variants . the missteps learned from the previous responses to the human immunodeﬁciency virus ( hiv ) and inﬂuenza outbreaks founded the hypothetical plan to ensure that vaccine accessibility to lmics is not impeded . the sars_cov_2 vaccines ’ social promise was to lessen the underlying racial , ethnic , and geographic inequities that covid_19 has both made apparent and intensiﬁed . vaccine nationalism was evident throughout the covid_19 crisis . many high_income countries directly negotiated large advance orders for the vaccines , leaving resource_limited countries scrambling for access . this occurred despite international initiatives to structure the development and equitable distribution of vaccines , channeled through a vaccine pillar : covid_19 vaccines global access ( covax ) . the serious supply shortages and national procurement methods of some countries that bypassed the vaccine pillar hindered the optimal function of covax in delivering timely and adequate doses to participating countries . covax strategized its approach by promoting fundraising , coordinating vaccine donations from countries with surplus doses , expediting reviews of vaccine candidates , and facilitating the expansion of the manufacturing capacity . while increasing capacity for production , technology transfer led to lesser siloes , enhanced manufacturing standardization , and less secrecy over production data . ultracold storage_requirements for leading vaccines were a considerable hurdle to the global immunization efforts , and particularly in lmics with limited equipment and resources to support sophisticated cold_chain systems . manufacturers strived to ease cold_chain restrictions on the basis of stability data submitted to national regulatory bodies . the development of single_dose vaccines offered promising solutions to simplify the administrative and logistic complexities that existed within the covid_19 vaccination programs . as such , the requirements for both ultracold storage conditions were eased , and concerns over booster doses were addressed . to expand coverage , the dosing intervals of the oxford/astrazeneca vaccines were extended according to data from phase_iii clinical_trials on effectiveness . in addition , with the recent outbreak of monkeypox , the lessons from past experiences of curbing infectious_diseases , including covid_19 , must be learned and acted upon . the review summarizes the global efforts with respect to vaccine development , production , allocation , and deployment to achieve equitable access . keywords : sars_cov_2 ; covid_19 vaccines ; health service accessibility ; global_health ; health equity ;

( who ) declared the pandemic , the world has witnessed an unimaginable scale of calamity and daily new conﬁrmed covid_19 deaths per million people ( 2122 deaths on 1 june 2022 ) [ 1 ] . the severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars_cov_2 ) was the stimulus for the covid_19 crisis . its genome encodes the surface_exposed structure of spike ( s ) glycoproteins . their important roles in viral attachment , fusion , and entry into the host_cell predisposed the s glycoproteins to be a direct target for host immune responses and the neutralization of antibodies , and , subsequently , they became the focus of most vaccines and therapeutic approaches [ 2 ] . similar to other rna viruses , sars_cov_2 undergoes rapid evolution through the accumulation of mutations within its viral genome , which has led to the emergence of vari_ ants of concern ( voc ) from india ( b.1.617.2 ) , south africa ( b.1.351 ) , the united_kingdom ( b.1.1.7 ) , and brazil ( p .1 ) . the occurrence of voc calls for a more stringent and consolidated approach to control the spread , as they are associated with higher transmissibility and the risk of mortality [ 3 ] . despite the emergence of new variants , the rollout of vaccines initiated by pﬁzer on 8 december 2020 offered a promising path to the attainment of herd_immunity . this was viewed as key to bring to a halt the pandemic [ 1 ] . upon testing in phase_iii clinical_trials , and now with pharmacovigilance and the post marketing surveillance of vaccines , the us food and drug administration ( fda ) and the who actively monitor the incidences of adverse_events following immunization ( aefi ) [ 1,4 ] . other vaccines , including moderna , oxford/astrazeneca , janssen , sinovac , sputnik v , sinopharm , cansino , epivaccorona , covaxin , rbd_dimer , abdala , and sober_ ana02 , have been approved for emergency use in numerous countries [ 4 ] . in the united_states , the fda issued initial emergency_use_authorization ( eua ) for pﬁzer/biontech on 11 december 2020 , and for moderna covid_19 vaccines on 18 december 2020 . of note , both vaccines were developed at a relatively accelerated rate using the novel mrna technology , and they assisted the early vaccination efforts , which led to reduced hospital_ ization and mortality rates . these vaccines were subsequently granted full approval by the fda in august 2021 ( pﬁzer/biontech ) and january 2022 ( moderna ) [ 5 ] . the eua for the pﬁzer/biontech vaccine was amended to include adolescents from 12 to 15 years_of_age ( issued on 10 may 2021 ) , and children from 5 to 11 years_of_age ( issued on 29 october 2021 ) , which allowed extended coverage to the pediatric population ( figure 1 ) . approval by national regulators furnished some degree of conﬁdence for individual countries in the vaccines ’ safety , quality , and efﬁcacy , thereby rendering them suitable for administration [ 4 ] . vaccines 2022 , 10 , x for

lessen the underlying racial , ethnic , and geographic inequities that covid_19 has both made apparent and intensiﬁed . evidently , vaccine nationalism was at_large throughout the covid_19 crisis [ 7 ] . the pre_existing vulnerable economies of the lmics meant that their citizens were already under a larger threat of unprecedented health , work , and livelihood disruption [ 4 ] . thus , during the pandemic , there was and still is a dire need for global equitable access to safe and effective vaccines to sustain public health systems and ultimately overcome economic downturn , particularly for lmics . in the past , throughout the hiv and inﬂuenza outbreaks , the world witnessed disad_ vantaged nations , and particularly africa , struggle with access to life_saving therapies . in those trying times , as antiretroviral drugs for hiv treatment began to penetrate the global market in the mid_1990s , the initial costs and prices of the drugs skyrocketed , which made the drugs hardly affordable [ 7 ] . while aids_related mortalities in rich and developed countries sharply declined , the death of over 12 million africans between 1997 and 2007 was attributable to the inaccessibility to the ground_breaking drugs [ 7 ] . the inﬂux of drugs to the continent were seen only in the early 21st century , following large funding commitments by the united_states president ’ s emergency plan for aids relief ( pepfar ) and the global_fund to fight aids , tuberculosis and malaria [ 8,9 ] . international calls to redeﬁne a global access framework for epidemic vaccines date back to the year 2004 , when highly pathogenic avian inﬂuenza a ( h5n1 ) ( hpai_h5n1 ) re_emerged . amidst the worldwide fear of a potential pandemic , frantic plans for h5n1 vaccine research and development commenced [ 10 ] . however , the plans received negative responses from developing_countries due to overwhelming concerns that , because of high patent prices , those vaccines would not be readily accessible to their populations . in 2007 , indonesia was one of the countries that was hit hard by avian inﬂuenza . however , a request by the who for h5n1 virus samples was declined and , as such , the surveillance and vaccine development efforts were hindered . in the absence of a global access framework for equitable vaccine distribution , fears mounted that the countries in dire need , or in which prevalence and incidences of outbreaks were high , were not actually receiving the required treatment [ 11 ] . the who subsequently attempted to initiate negotiations for the sharing and stockpiling of h5n1 vaccine doses , but to no avail [ 12 ] . when another inﬂuenza outbreak of a different strain ( h1n1 ) shocked the world in 2009 , vaccines were considered of paramount importance against a highly infectious strain that spread infections easily and quickly around the globe [ 13 ] . access inequity was apparent as more developed countries swept up sizeable vaccine orders in advance , procuring nearly all of the manufactured doses [ 14 ] . despite their initial promises to donate parts of the vaccines to lmics under the who and united nations_sponsored plans , their nationalistic behavior overrode , and thus the premediated planning and strategizing were futile , and the distribution mechanism proved ﬂawed . in fact , the more afﬂuent countries proceeded to secure supplies for their own populations , leaving lmic countries with limited supplies and the untimely delivery of vaccines [ 15 ] . the h1n1 vaccine distribution inevitably occurred on the basis of the purchasing_power of the high_income countries and was not based on the geographical justiﬁcation for the epidemiology or risk of transmission . 3 . global allocation 3.1 . the issue of vaccine nationalism in mid_2010 , the ebola epidemic in west_africa unearthed the lack of international capacity to be collectively prepared and responsive , and to recover from outbreaks of infectious_diseases . the unpreparedness in managing an epidemic crisis prompted recom_ mendations by the united_nations secretary_general ’ s global_health crises task force for the establishment of an independent monitoring and evaluation body to safeguard vaccines 2022 ,10 , 1306 4 of 14 the global interest in and preparedness for health calamities . this led to the launch of the global preparedness monitoring board ( gpmb ) in 2018 . within a year , the gpmb produced its inaugural report titled “ a world at risk ” , which cautioned against the risk of rapidly spreading respiratory pathogens owing to the knowledge of the intermittent yet unpredictable and abrupt emergence of new inﬂuenza strains [ 16 ] . in the report , recommen_ dations were made for countries to harmonize the “ means to share limited countermeasures across countries ” [ 16 ] . merely three months later , world leaders were once again faced with a health emergency . this time , the catastrophes struck with far greater magnitude . covid_19 destabilized global healthcare frontiers , toppled ﬁnances , and redeﬁned the very essence of social norms . the gpmb ’ s preconceived notion that countries could be deviating from the con_ sensus and international concerted efforts to achieve equitable access to scarce medical countermeasures became a reality when national leaders opted for “ vaccine nationalism ” in the wake of the covid_19 pandemic [ 17 ] . many high_income countries with substantial resources directly negotiated huge advance orders for the vaccine in return for considerable investments in research and production infrastructure . for instance , the united_kingdom was the ﬁrst country in the world to attain access to astrazeneca ’ s vaccines , which were codeveloped with the university of oxford . the ﬁrst 30 million_doses that were manufac_ tured were allotted in exchange for an investment worth usd 79 million [ 18 ] . additionally , astrazeneca reported that the united_states was promised a delivery of at least 300 million_doses as early as october 2020 , and this was after the country pledged usd 1.2 billion worth of investment in its company [ 19 ] . one has to recognize that , to bring covid_19 crises to a complete halt , or at least to states of endemicity , the medical countermeasures ought to reach every nook and cranny . because of its high rate and strength of infectivity , the entire population living across the globe requires full immunization . this should remain the aim , regardless of a nation ’ s ﬁnancial strength and resources to secure the valuable supplies . the inequitable deployment of vaccines in lmics poses the risk of the divergent quality of healthcare , economic_shock_induced global inequities , large_scale migration , and insecurity [ 20 ] . a further deterioration in global_health and economic calamity could occur should high_income nations continue to opt for a nationalistic stance . with the latest outbreak of monkeypox , lessons from past experiences of managing infectious_diseases , and particularly covid_19 , must be learned and acted upon [ 21,22 ] . 3.2 . overcoming vaccine nationalism through cov ax a “ call to action for the access to covid_19 tools ( act ) accelerator ( act_a ) ” was issued on 24 april 2020 by the president of the european commission , the director_general of the who , heads of states , and other development partners . this was followed by a pledge for international solidarity by various countries , civil_society , industries , and development partners in two consecutive events [ 23 ] . the act_a is a global coordinating mechanism that is targeted at boosting the development and equitable distribution of three important countermeasures : therapeutics , diagnostics , and vaccines , through actions from multiple international stakeholders . structured initiatives for vaccines are channeled through the vaccine pillar , named covid_19 vaccines global access ( covax ) , which was co_led by the coalition for epi_ demic preparedness innovations and the global alliance for vaccines and immunizations ( gavi ) . covax aims to support the timely research and development of effective vac__cines to be used in all countries . instead of relying on an uncoordinated method in which countries scramble to secure vaccine doses directly from the manufacturers for their own population use , a proportional distribution scheme through covax is theoretically better organized and reasonable . this requires cooperation and commitment at the international level to prevent the hoarding of vaccines [ 24 ] . to secure two billion vaccine doses for fair distribution by the end of 2021 , and partic_ ularly in lmics , the initiative strived to strengthen the manufacturing infrastructure and procurement capabilities [ 23 ] . the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations ( cepi ) vaccines 2022 ,10 , 1306 5 of 14 is the leading foundation in acquiring strategic vaccine development partnerships with nations around the world , building the capacity needed for vaccine research and devel_ opment , and reinforcing local expertise [ 25 ] . meanwhile , the global alliance for vaccines and immunization ( gavi ) is an international public–private partnership that focuses on the procurement and distribution of covax through its suborganizations—the covax facility and gavi covax advance market commitment ( amc ) [ 26 ] . cepi and gavi work alongside the who and its vaccine review body of the strategic advisory group of experts on immunization ( sage ) committee , which developed the values framework for the allo_ cation and prioritization of covid_19 vaccination [ 27 ] . the values framework advocates that vaccine distribution shall consider the epidemic risks and necessities of all nations , with special attention given to lmics . the pandemic presents with a global recession , which is the ﬁrst since world_war ii . thus , the who sage committee recommends that high_income countries abstain from undercutting vaccine supplies to nations with less political or economic power , and instead participate in achieving global access through covax [ 27,28 ] . 3.3 . is inequitable allocation nonexistent with cov ax ? more than 700 million_doses of varying vaccine brands were administered in over 194 countries within four months of the global rollout in december 2020 [ 29 ] . fourteen countries had yet to start vaccinations due to the procurement challenges posed beyond the covax facility . they were not ready , nor were they planning to begin within the next couple of weeks or months . however , the who stated that 87 % of these doses had reached high_income and upper_middle_income countries , while the lower_income countries only received a dismal proportion of 0.2 % [ 30 ] . an apparent inequity in the global vaccine distribution was indicated , as 1 in every 4 people in wealthy countries had the vaccine , as opposed to merely 1 in an excess of 500 individuals in less fortunate countries . it was even more alarming when , simultaneously , physicians , who were a minority and a scarce subpopulation in sub_saharan africa , died from covid_19 due to not receiving the rightful protection and immunization [ 31 ] . the who attributed the supply shortage to covax , citing allocation disparity as the main reason for the inequity . by the end of march 2021 , covax was originally expected to deliver up to 100 million_doses , but the actual number had shrunk to only 38 million [ 30 ] . moreover , the national procurement strategies of some countries that bypassed covax to directly deal with the vaccine developers based on commercial and political grounds posed another threat to global equity [ 32 ] . the practice of direct purchasing that was initiated by high_income countries was emulated by the rest of the world . as of february 2021 , 62 nations had taken matters into their own hands , initiated procurement agreements , and signed off on deals directly with manufacturing companies [ 33 ] . nevertheless , covax was of relevance to countries that were not ﬁnancially able to self_procure sufﬁcient doses , and in particular , the low_income countries . agreements reached by covax with ﬁve manufacturers to secure 2 billion doses were in line with the organizational goal of inoculating at least 20 % of its members ’ populations by the end of 2021 [ 32,34 ] . many other strategies enforced by covax evolved around efforts to speed up production and supply . the alliance sought vaccine donations from high_income countries with surplus doses , and it expedited the review of vaccine candidates and the expansion of the global manufacturing capacity [ 30 ] . the success of covax highly depended on the availability of ﬁnancial resources to procure vaccines . as of may 2021 , the ﬁnancial donations amounted to usd 6.3 billion and originated mainly from government agencies and partners . to further bridge the gap of usd 2.6 billion , the who foundation launched a mass fundraising campaign called “ go give one ” , calling for small contributions from everyone around the world [ 35,36 ] . many wondered whether or not covax ’ s target of equity in the early stages of global immunization was too farfetched . in response to this , covax provided its assurance that , with monetary and external support , it could effectively accelerate access to vaccines for lower_income countries through provision at vaccines 2022 ,10 , 1306 6 of 14 reduced prices , and the assistance provided by initiating vaccination programs at a much sooner rather than later date [ 32 ] . by january 2022 , the global inequities in the distribution of covid_19 vaccines were better alleviated through internationally pooled procurement within the covax facility . poorer countries received greater beneﬁts than higher_income nations from the numbers of covax_secured vaccine doses [ 37 ] . the largest disparities between the shares of total allocated and distributed vaccine doses were still notably apparent in countries with lower income levels . however , this was due to a lack of cold_chain readiness rather than inequality in distribution [ 32 ] . to assist covax_eligible countries to prepare for meeting the minimum conditions of the vaccine distribution system , the who and the united_nations children ’ s fund ( unicef ) established a guidance note on the logistics and supply management of covid_19 vaccines [ 38 ] . 4 . vaccine development and manufacture 4.1 . the development of single_dose covid vaccines the availability of single_dose vaccines offers a promising solution to streamlining the administrative challenges that are faced during inoculation efforts . unlike the mrna vaccines of pﬁzer/biontech and moderna , which require two doses and storage at subzero temperatures , the one_shot vaccine developed by johnson_&_johnson ( j & j ) , named the janssen covid_19 vaccine , can be stored for a maximum duration of three months in a standard refrigerator from 2c to 8c [ 39 ] . in the same month ( february 2021 ) that j & j received the greenlight from the fda , another single_dose vaccine produced by china , named cansino , was approved in its country of origin . the recombinant j & j and cansino vaccines utilize a distinct manufac_ turing technique with adenovirus vectors type 26 and 5 , respectively [ 40 ] . the technology provides an advantage for logistics in that distribution can occur at the normal refrigeration temperature , which is more cost saving and convenient than the requirements for the pre_ ceding vaccines , which needed to be transported frozen [ 41 ] . a one_shot vaccine regimen could potentially enhance the outreach to more remote areas , where the challenge usually lies in delivering the supplies without any degradation in the potency or safety . in addition , the setup for appointments can be conducted once , instead of the usual follow_up arrange_ ment for booster doses , which ideally takes place with the preceding vaccination [ 42 ] . moreover , an exploratory subgroup analysis of the janssen vaccine for a phase_iii trial in the united_states found that the one_shot vaccine was 72 % ( 95 % conﬁdence interval ( ci ) , 58.2–81.7 % ) effective at preventing a moderate to severe/critical covid_19 infection for at least 28 days following immunization [ 43 ] . different endpoints were utilized for the phase_iii trials of the cansino vaccine , in which it was suggested that the vaccine was 68.83 % and 65.28 % effective in preventing symptomatic covid_19 infection 14 days and 28 days , respectively , after administration [ 44 ] . therefore , the development of single_dose vaccines , which are proven safe and effective , may assist in achieving global equitable access to the valuable countermeasures . 4.2 . technology transfer as a means to boost the manufacturing capacity in early 2021 , countries of the european union encountered severe supply shortages , which induced public frustration . mass media and mass communications were used to exert pressure on political leaders [ 45 ] . many lmics are still facing far greater challenges in securing vaccine supplies . with the development and authorization of increasing numbers of vaccines for emergency use , government bodies and production companies need innova_ tive solutions to prepare for imminent mass production and to meet the unprecedented global demand for vaccines . failing this , and given the current and forecasted global recession for millions living across the globe , and particularly for those living in poorer countries , receiving their ﬁrst jabs by 2024 might not be attainable [ 46 ] . the solution of relaxing patent protection is likely to invite much controversy in the proﬁt_driven pharmaceutical industry . however , patent waivers in a time of epidemic crisis vaccines 2022 ,10 , 1306 7 of 14 can speed up global vaccine access [ 47 ] . an alternative method to accelerate this is through technology transfer , in which the developer of the original pharmaceutical product forms partnerships with companies in middle_income_countries . this facilitates the production of vaccines locally in distant regions . the serum institute of india , the world ’ s largest vaccine manufacturer , had such agreements with the developers of covid_19 vaccines , namely , astrazeneca and novavax . astrazeneca also made multiple collaborations for technology transfer with mabxience buenos_aires in argentina , fiocruz in brazil , and siam bioscience in thailand [ 32 ] . the nature of these partnerships is generally uncommon and is , in fact , unfavorable to the respective parent companies ; however , a deal made between two of the world ’ s largest pharmaceutical manufacturers , merck and johnson_&_johnson , to combine technologies for increased production was highly commendable [ 48 ] . from another perspective , technology transfer will not only be beneﬁcial during the pandemic , but it could also potentially lead to fewer siloes , thereby enhancing the manufacturing quality through standardization , and deriving less proﬁt_driven secrecy over production data in the future [ 49 ] . 5 . vaccine deployment 5.1 . vaccine cold_chain challenge maintaining the vaccine supply_chain at constant temperatures is one of the biggest challenges posed to the deployment of temperature_sensitive products , including covid_ 19 vaccines . a number of ﬁrst_generation vaccines incorporated ultracold_chain technology and , hence , they possessed short_term stability outside the recommended storage con_ ditions [ 50 ] . this inﬂicted substantial hurdles to the global immunization efforts , and particularly in low_income countries , which lack established equipment to support sophis_ ticated cold_chain systems . around one_ﬁfth of the world ’ s most impoverished nations were not equipped with sufﬁcient cold_chain capacities . in some other countries , despite having the infrastructure , the equipment was either broken or outdated and , as such , these nations struggled to sustain optimal temperatures for vaccines [ 51 ] . the gavi board recently pledged to explore its cold_chain equipment optimization platform ( cceop ) to potentially improve the cold_chain capacities in lmics . one of the ways proposed is through the procurement of additional refrigerators , including solar_powered refrigerators , that are suitable for vaccines [ 52 ] . meanwhile , the manufacturers , by way of improving formulations , also strived to ease their ultracold_chain requirements and extend shelf_lives to facilitate simpler adminis_ tration and storage conditions . the pﬁzer/biontech vaccine initially required adminis_ tration within 5 days of removal from its ultralow freezing temperature ( from  80c to  60c ) [ 32 ] . on 25 february 2021 , the drug company ’ s application was approved by the fda , and an announcement was made that the newer vaccine batches would no longer be subjected to rigid cold_chain restrictions . based on pﬁzer inc. ’ s submitted stability data to the national regulatory body , conventional temperatures that are normally found in pharmaceutical freezers would be permitted for the transportation and storage of undiluted frozen vials for a maximum period of 2 weeks [ 53 ] . this duration was in addition to the 5 days that was applicable to the storage of the thawed vials in the refrigerator [ 54 ] . the updated conditions required for transportation and storage greatly reduced the burden of purchasing ultracold_chain storage infrastructure at vaccination sites . similarly , moderna , with the fda ’ s approval , announced in early april 2021 that updates had been made to their regulations to allow their vaccine shots to be administered into the arms more efﬁciently and rapidly . the ﬁrst revision to their regulations allowed the extension of the vials ’ shelf_life after the ﬁrst puncture from 6 h to 12 h [ 55 ] . the preceding shorter duration of stability evidently caused healthcare workers to hurry to administer before the 6 h shelf_life ended . on many occasions , young healthy individuals ended up receiving jabs despite not being listed among the national prioritization groups , as the leftover doses would have otherwise gone to waste [ 56 ] . additionally , moderna ’ s change in shipment sizes , to allow ﬁve additional doses per vial , was intended to facilitate vaccines 2022 ,10 , 1306 8 of 14 mass vaccination through increased dose delivery [ 57 ] . table 1 summarizes the latest attributes and requirements for the storage and handling of the main covid_19 vaccines as of 1 july

. dosing_interval prolongation to expand coverage the decision on the dosing intervals of covid_19 vaccines was theoretically made based on the clinical_trial data submitted to the who and respective regulatory bodies [ 64 ] . the leading vaccines typically have deﬁned durations of intervals between two doses for administration . overwhelming concerns about the limited supply and the issue of vaccine logistics generated a need for the continuous revision of the dosing intervals . in view of vaccines 2022 ,10 , 1306 9 of 14 the rapidly changing waves of infection , and with an intention to optimize the numbers to receive a ﬁrst_dose , several countries , including the united_kingdom , canada , india , and malaysia , implemented an extension to the schedule for the administration of the second dose [ 64–66 ] . this led to the question of whether or not the expanded vaccination coverage in the current environment of highly active transmissions might be offset by a hypothetical augmented risk for viral mutations and voc [ 64 ] . nonetheless , the preliminary data indicated that single_dose covid_19 vaccines were capable of delivering high efﬁcacy levels , thus supporting the motion for second_dose delays . this was substantiated by the joint committee on vaccination and immunization ’ s data analysis , which indicated that a single shot of either vaccine would be able to provide signiﬁcant protection from within 2 to 3 weeks of inoculation for clinical diseases , and particularly for the severe presentation of covid_19 diseases [ 67 ] . despite being considered essential to ensuring durable protection , the expected increase in vaccine efﬁcacy that was to result from the booster dose was likely to be rather “ modest ” . in addition , effectiveness data from the united_kingdom and canada , along with the mathematical modeling from respective clinical_trial publications , demonstrated that a single dose of the pﬁzer/biontech or oxford/astrazeneca vaccines might offer protection for a prolonged period of 8 weeks from vaccination [ 68–70 ] . the extended interval between two doses of the oxford/astrazeneca vaccine was associated with an even higher effec_ tiveness of the vaccine . recent data from phase_iii clinical_trials that assessed the optional timing of the second dose found that the vaccine efﬁcacy in the ﬁrst 12 weeks did not wane . participants who had their second jabs beyond 12 weeks of the ﬁrst_dose had 82.4 % efﬁcacy , as opposed to 54.9 % in those who had an interdose interval of less than 6 weeks apart [ 64 ] . these ﬁndings lent support for inoculation approaches that delay the booster dose beyond the initial recommended interval of 4 weeks for the oxford/astrazeneca vaccine . this method received a subsequent endorsement by the who sage committee [ 71 ] . despite the limited ability to extrapolate the ﬁndings to other covid_19 vaccines , these early ﬁndings substantiate the need for further research on dosing_interval optimization , and present chances for accelerated population coverage and vaccine equity . 5.3 . mix_and_match vaccination with an exception for the janssen vaccine , the majority of the covid_19 vaccines require a two_dose prime_boost immunization strategy as the primary_course dosing , administered between 3 and 12 weeks apart ( table 1 ) . traditionally , most covid_19 vaccines follow a homologous prime_boost schedule : both the priming and booster doses utilize the same vaccine type . reports of the rare yet potentially life_threatening occurrence of thromboembolic events following adenovirus vector_based vaccine administration ( the oxford/astrazeneca and janssen vaccines ) resulted in modiﬁcations of key vaccination policies in multiple european countries , leading to the introduction of heterologous prime_ boost strategies [ 72 ] . individuals who received an adenovirus vector vaccine as a primer are now recommended for a booster with an alternative vaccine type , such as the mrna vaccines . a phase i/ii trial in the united_states evaluating the prime_boost permutations of the moderna , janssen , and pﬁzer/biontech vaccines found that both heterologous regimens elicited higher antibody titers ( from 6.2 to 76 times ) , compared with a 4.2–20_time increment following a homologous schedule [ 73 ] . similar systemic reactogenicity proﬁles were also noted . in addition , large nationwide cohort studies observed a comparable vaccine efﬁcacy against covid_19 disease after a heterologous astrazeneca/mrna_based vaccine prime_boost ( 79–88 % ) , as opposed to after a homologous mrna vaccination ( 80–90 % ) [ 74 ] . the international interest in the use of a heterologous prime_boost covid_19 vaccine regimen with similar immunogenicity and reactogenicity proﬁles is growing , and particu_ larly to help solve the problem of ﬂuctuating vaccine stockpiles and , hence , the delayed administration of booster doses . due to the aforementioned justiﬁcations , the centers_for_disease_control and prevention ( cdc ) advisory_committee_on_immunization_practices vaccines 2022 ,10 , 1306 10 of 14 ( acip ) supported the mix_and_match heterologous immunization strategy for covid_19 through its guidance release in october 2021 [ 75 ] . 6 . vaccine acceptance and safety 6.1 . the issue of vaccine hesitancy ensuring widespread covid_19 vaccine acceptance is just as important as the strive towards equitable vaccine access . vaccine hesitancy is a signiﬁcant hurdle to achieving sufﬁcient covid_19 immunization coverage , as it is inﬂuenced by the trust in vaccines and the institutions that administer them . a systematic_review and meta_analysis of 172 studies across 50 countries reported a pooled acceptance proportion of 61 % ( ci : 59–64 % ) . higher acceptance was found in the southeast_asian countries , in males , among health_ care professionals , and for vaccines with 95 % effectiveness [ 76 ] . lazarus et al . ( 2021 ) suggested that asian countries leaned towards a relatively high acceptance rate , which is attributable to unwavering support for its community , the social_support system , and the trust placed in their central governments [ 77 ] . another study observed a higher willingness forcovid_19 uptake in lmic samples across asia , africa , south asia , and latin america ( 80.3 % , 95 % ci : 74.9–85.6 % ) , compared with high_income nations , such as the united_states ( 64.6 % , ci : 61.8–67.3 ) and russia ( 30.4 % , ci : 29.1–31.7 % ) [ 78 ] . such wide differences in the willingness to receive covid_19 vaccination are alarming and need to be addressed to prevent variations in international immunization coverage . 6.2 . rarity of severe adverse_events following covid_19 vaccination concerns about the safety and possible side_effects have frequently been cited as barriers to covid_19 vaccine uptake [ 78 ] . of note , the primary severe adverse_events reported among adults have been extremely rare : anaphylaxis ( from 2.5 to 4.8 cases per million_doses ) and myocarditis ( from 6 to 27 cases per million ) for mrna_typed vaccines . reports have also been received on guillain–barr ésyndrome ( 7.8 cases per million ) for the janssen vaccine , and thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome ( tts ) for both the oxford/astrazeneca vaccine ( 2 cases per million ) and janssen vaccine ( 3 cases per million ) [ 79 ] . surveillance systems have reported no obvious signals of adverse maternal , pregnancy , or infant outcomes following mrna vaccination [ 80 ] . in contrast , when unvac_ cinated , an elevated risk for severe covid_19 infections has been observed in pregnancy , with the babies more likely to be admitted to the neonatal_intensive_care_unit [ 81 ] . therefore , the delivery of accurate information through widespread media coverage on the beneﬁts of vaccines and the rarity of potential serious_adverse_events may alleviate the problem of vaccine hesitancy . 7 . conclusions the launch of global covid_19 vaccination campaigns has generated hope that the global population and societies around the world stand a chance of returning to a certain degree of normalcy . however , the covid_19 vaccines that are safe and effective can only be meaningful to the global community if they are accessible in a timely manner . despite the extraordinary achievement of delivering vaccine candidates to the wider market within a short time span of one year , the multiple challenges faced to achieve this , persist to this day . a collaborative response to achieve global equitable access is key . in this paper , we discuss the global vaccination challenges that continue to maneuver the direction of vaccine development , manufacture , allocation , and deployment . decisionmakers around the world need to remain vigilant and responsive to their commitment to ending the pandemic and facilitating the transition to endemicity . these unprecedented times call for commitments through global unity to render vaccines equitable . indeed , it is an ethical test that transcends borders . author contributions : conceptualization , l.n.h.m.k . and m.l.f . ; methodology , l.n.h.m.k . ; re_ sources , m.l.f . ; writing—original draft preparation , l.n.h.m.k . ; writing—review and editing , vaccines 2022 ,10 , 1306 11 of 14 l.n.h.m.k. , m.l.f . and a.i.l . ; funding acquisition , m.l.f . all authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript . funding : this research received no external funding . institutional_review_board statement : not applicable . informed_consent statement : not applicable . data availability statement : all relevant data are available in the article . acknowledgments : we wish to thank the faculty of pharmacy , uitm , for its continued support . conﬂicts of interest : the authors declare no conﬂict of interest . references 1 . ritchie , h. ; orttiz_ospina , e. ; beltekian , d. ; methieu , e. ; hasell , j. ; macdonald , b. ; dattani , s. ; roser , m. coronavirus ( covid_19 ) vaccinations : statistics and research . our world in data . 2022 . available online : https : //ourworldindata.org/covid_vaccinations ( accessed on 1 july 2022 ) . 2 . duan , l. ; zheng , q. ; zhang , h. ; niu , y. ; lou , y. ; wang , h. the sars_cov_2 spike glycoprotein biosynthesis , structure , function , and antigenicity : implications for the design of spike_based vaccine immunogens . front . immunol . 2020 ,11 , 576622 .

article comparative_effectiveness over time of the mrna_1273 ( moderna ) vaccine and the bnt162b2 ( pﬁzer_biontech ) vaccine nazmul islam1 , natalie e. sheils1 , megan s. jarvis1 & kenneth cohen1,2✉ real_world analysis of the incidence of sars_cov_2_infection post vaccination is important in determining the comparative_effectiveness of the available vaccines . in this retrospectivecohort study using deidenti ﬁed administrative claims for medicare advantage and com_ mercially insured individuals in a research database we examine over 3.5 million fully vac_cinated individuals , including 8,848 individuals with sars_cov_2_infection , with a follow_upperiod between 14 and 151 days after their second dose . our primary outcome was the rate ofcovid_19 infection occurring at 30 , 60 , and 90 days at least 14 days after the second dose ofeither the mrna_1273 vaccine or the bnt162b2 vaccine . sub_analyses included the incidenceof hospitalization , icu_admission , and death/hospice transfer . separate analysis was con_ducted for individuals above and below age 65 and those without a prior diagnosis of covid_19 . we show that immunization with mrna_1273 , compared to bnt162b2 , provides slightlymore protection against sars_cov_2_infection that reaches statistical signi ﬁcance at 90 days with a number needed to vaccinate of > 290 . there are no differences in vaccine effectiveness for protection against hospitalization , icu_admission , or death/hospice transfer ( aor 1.23,95 % ci ( 0.67 , 2.25 ) ) .https : //doi.org/10.1038/s41467_022_30059_3 open 1optum labs ,

the need to study the relative real_world effectiveness of the available vaccines against covid_19 . the mrna_1273 ( moderna ) vaccineand the bnt162b2 ( p ﬁzer–biontech ) vaccine have both proven highly effective in preventing severe_disease , hospitalization , and death from covid_19 . however , data suggest that the humoral antibody response to the vaccines differs , with two doses of the mrna_1273 vaccine providing signi_ﬁcantly higher humoral antibody response compared with two doses of the bnt162b2 vaccine in both uninfected and previously_infected individuals across all age categories 1 . this is clinically relevant as several studies have demonstrated that higher humoral antibody responses correlate with enhanced protection against covid_192 . data also suggest that infection rates follow the same trend as the humoral antibody response . observational data incorporating cases of delta voc have suggested a higher rate of infection in individuals immunized with two doses of the bnt162b2 vaccine compared with two doses of the mrna_1273 vaccine , suggesting that the real_world performance of the vaccines may differ from one another3 . we therefore conducted a retrospective cohort_study that examined the incidence and severity of covid_19 infections as a function of the time from vaccination in over 3.5 million indi_ viduals across the united_states who were fully_vaccinated via either the mrna_1273 or the bnt162b2 vaccine , including over8800 infections ; see fig . 1 . understanding the clinical perfor_ mance of each vaccine is critically important to determine the comparative_effectiveness of the vaccines . our primary outcome is the rate of covid_19 infection occurring at 30 , 60 , and 90 days at least 14 days after the second dose of either the mrna_1273 vaccine or the bnt162b2 vaccine . results in a population of over 3.5 million fully_vaccinated individuals , 8848 experienced documented covid_19 infections . of those , 3090 ( 35 % ) received mrna_1273 and 5758 ( 65 % ) received bnt162b2 ( table 1and fig . 1 ) . median_age and prevalence of many comorbid conditions were similar across groups considered ( table 1 ) . models for the seven negative outcomes , included to assure there were no unaccounted_for differences between groups receiving bnt162b and mrna_1273 , exhibited negligible mean bias arising from systemic errors ( table s3 ) . kaplan –meier curves report that the estimated time to infection and time to severe negative outcomes de ﬁned as any hospitalization , icu_admission , death , or discharge to hospice , whichever occurs ﬁrst , are reported in fig . 2 . in the raw data , a statistically signi_ﬁcant difference ( p_value < 0.001 ) with a diverging trend over time is observed between bnt162b and

persists in the ph model_based predictions for a general patient ( fig . 2a ) . there are no statistically signi_ﬁcant differences between the predicted probabilities of the two vaccines ( fig . 2b , d ) for the composite outcome of hospitalization , icu_admission , death , or transfer to hospice . adjusted odds ratios for likelihood of infection 30 , 60 , and 90 days_post vaccination ( 14 days after the second dose ) show that the mrna_1273 vaccine is associated with lower odds of infection . for the unadjusted model with iptw as sampling weights , the nnv to observe this difference ranges from 1,047 over 30 days to 290 over 90 days ( fig . 3 ) , signaling superior mrna_1273 vaccine effects over time in reducing the likelihood of infection . this dif_ference is consistent across all the models considered . however , for severe adverse outcomes ( icu_admission , composite icu admis_ sion/death/referral to hospice , or composite hospitalization/icu_admission/death/referral to hospice ) , while events are rare , no sta_ tistically signi_ﬁcant differences between the two vaccines were observed ( fig . s4 –6 ) . as shown in fig . 4 , time_to_event analysis assuming right censoring , was performed and provided similar results to the binary outcome results for different model speci ﬁca_ tions , including for outcomes of infection ( ahr 0.69 , 95 % ci ( 0.66 , 0.72 ) ) , composite icu_admission/death/referral to hospice ( ahr 0.76 , 95 % ci ( 0.50 , 1.16 ) ) , and composite hospitalization/icu_admission/death/referral to hospice ( ahr 0.67 , 95 % ci ( 0.51 , 0.89 ) ) . risk differences between mrna_1273_and_bnt162b2 for both infection and composite outcomes increase over time ( fig . 4b ) , this observation is in alignment with the binary outcome results ( fig . 3 ) .we further considered time_to_event analyses among all those experiencing infections in our sample for icu_admission , com_ posite icu_admission/death/referral to hospice , and composite hospitalization/icu_admission/death/referral to hospice . no sta_ tistically signi_ﬁcant differences between vaccines were observed for adverse composite outcomes ( figs . s12 –14 ) . the results are similar for the strati ﬁed analyses of ( 1 ) including only patients with no prior diagnosis of covid_19 ( fig . s11 ) , ( 2 ) including only patients who are aged 65 or older ( fig . s9 ) , and ( 3 ) including only patients who are aged 64 and younger ( fig . s10 ) . since the population considered is different in each model , between_model comparisons are not valid , however , both models show directionally the same results . it is known that certain comorbidities worsen prognosis in an unvaccinated population . our models indicate that in a vaccinated population , congestive_heart_failure ( ahr 1.52 , 95 % ci ( 1.03 , 2.26 ) ) , hypertension ( ahr 2.17 , 95 % ci ( 1.30 , 3.62 ) ) , and lymphoma ( ahr 7.03 , 95 % ci ( 4.31,11.47 ) ) increase the likelihood of experiencing the composite adverse_event of hospitalization , icu_admission , or death/ transfer to hospice . this difference persisted even after adjusting for which vaccine a person received , sociodemographic variables , transfer from nursing facility , timing of vaccination , place of residence , and historical comorbidities ( fig . s7 ) . discussion multiple studies have shown that the incidence of sars_cov_2_infection in vaccinated individuals has increased over the last time to infection time to hospitalization , icu , death , or discharge to hospice fig . 2 predicted survival probabilities . panels ( a ) and ( b ) show predicted survival probabilities based on the univariate model with inverse probability of treatment weight ( iptw ) for ( a ) sars_cov_2_infection and ( b ) hospitalization/icu/death/hospice , whichever occurs ﬁrst . raw data are shown in ( c ) and ( d ) via kaplan –meier curves for time_to_events among all individuals vaccinated by june 1 , 2021 , for the event of ( c ) infection , ( d ) hospitalization/icu/ death/hospice , whichever occurs ﬁrst.article nature communications | https : //doi.org/10.1038/s41467_022_30059_3 4 nature communications | ( 2022 ) 13:2377 | https : //doi.org/10.1038/s41467_022_30059_3 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications year . this increase may be related to the higher transmissibility of the delta and omicron voc and/or the potential contribution of waning immunity post vaccination . these data underscore the need to understand the comparative_effectiveness of the available vaccines . two important questions must be answered to address the comparative_effectiveness of the bnt162b and mrna_1273 vaccines . the ﬁrst is whether each vaccine is equivalent in its ability to prevent severe_disease from covid_19 . the data availablefrom our large population of patients suggest that at 90 days out from vaccination , there is no signi_ﬁcant difference between bnt162b and mrna_1273 in terms of the risk of the composite outcome of hospitalization , icu_admission , or death/transfer to hospice ( aor [ 95 % con ﬁdence interval ] : 1.23 [ 0.67 , 2.25 ] , fig . s6 ) . we analyzed data both from a binary and time_to_event outcome point of view , each quantifying the association between patient outcomes and vaccine types with different model speci_ ﬁcations . conclusions remain similar , irrespective of modeling framework , highlighting the robustness of our methods . the second question is whether there is a higher incidence of sars__cov_2 infections with the bnt162b vaccine compared with the mrna_1273 vaccine , and here there is a statistically signi_ﬁcant difference in favor of the mrna_1273 vaccine . this difference appears very early post vaccination and increases over time . the nnv with the mrna_1273 vaccine compared with the bnt162b vaccine to prevent one case of sars_cov_2 is 1047 at thirty days_post vaccination ( aor [ 95 % ci ] : 0.67 [ 0.63 , 0.71 ] ) , but is 290 at ninety days_post vaccination ( aor [ 95 % ci ] : 0.66 [ 0.60 , 0.73 ] ) . although this incremental risk is small at the individual level , it is meaningful at the population level . our results suggest that for every 1 million individuals vaccinated with the bnt162b vaccine compared with the mrna_1273 vaccine , this would represent 3,448 additional care_seeking cases of covid_19 at 90 days.delta infection was of very low prevalence when these data were collected , and therefore unlikely affected our comparative_effectiveness results . however , as new vocs emerge , each of these may have unique characteristics that would impact their ability to evade vaccine_induced immunity . periodic updates to this analysis will allow us to track the comparative_effectiveness of mrna_1273 and bnt162b in the setting of the emergence of new vocs , including delta and omicron . this study has limitations . first , the analysis is restricted to commercially insured and medicare advantage bene ﬁciaries from a single u.s. insurer , a group that is unevenly distributed across the united_states geographically and demographically . nevertheless , this study re ﬂects a large and comprehensive sample of u.s. vaccinations . second , we are unable to measure sars_cov_2_infection that is not apparent in medical claims or via laboratory testing , which likely results in an overestimate of the vaccines ’ protective effects . this includes the fact that our “ time_to_infection ” represents date of infection from our data ( positive pcr test , or icd_10 code of u07.1 in claims ) , rather than the date on which sars_cov_2 was contracted . notably , asymptomatic or mild disease for which an individual did not seek care are not captured . how ever , serious_adverse_events , which pose the most strain on the healthcare system and for individuals , are reliably observable in our data and are less affected by diagnosis_dependent biases over time . finally , we do not include an analysis accounting for calendar time as a proxy to infer the likely variant of infection as this additional con_ founder would further complicate already_nuanced results . while not undertaken here , further study to understand the relative effectiveness against all variants of concern is needed and will be conducted when our data on infection with delta and omicron are more complete . basic counts are

aor 1.23 , 95 % ci ( 0.67 , 2.25 ) ) . methods this paper follows strobe reporting guidelines for cohort studies . this study was deemed exempt from institutional board review by the unitedhealth_group of ﬁce of human research affairs due to using deidenti ﬁed retrospective data . data sources . we used administrative deidenti ﬁed claims for medicare advantage and commercially insured individuals in a research database , including vaccination status through may 31 , 2021 . this study was reviewed and deemed exempt by the institutional_review_board of unitedhealth_group . population . starting with all medicare advantage or commercial enrollees 18 years or older vaccinated after emergency_use authorization ( eua ) for either mrna_1273 or bnt162b2 who were fully_vaccinated ( received their second dose with 14 days ofadditional observation ) on or before may 31 , 2021 . those who received a second dose earlier than eua_approved timeframe ( 21 days for bnt162b2 and 28 days for mrna_1273 ) or more than 42 days after their ﬁrst_dose were excluded fromanalyses . we then required valid zip_code information and excluded any patients who experienced a covid_related event ( icd_10 code u07.1 in inpatient or out_ patient setting or positive pcr laboratory test for sars_cov_2 ) within 13 days of their second dose and none after “ full vaccination , ” which is considered 14 days after the second dose , to eliminate those whose infections occurred before they were fully_vaccinated ( fig . 1 ) . for subsequent analyses , we subdivided this group into those who had at least 30 , 60 , and 90 days of follow_up observation . in the supplementary information , we also look in particular at the subset of 8848 fully_vaccinated indi_ viduals who became infected with covid_19 ( identi ﬁed either by a positive pcr test or icd_10 code u07.1 , including er , outpatient , and inpatient hospital visits ) . outcome measure . our main outcome was sars_cov_2_infection identi ﬁed either by a positive pcr test or covid_19 icd_10 code u07.1 in claims , including er , outpatient , and inpatient hospital visits . we de ﬁne this as a “ care_seeking ” population . we also considered icu_admission , hospital admission , and the composite of either inpatient mortality or discharge to hospice within 30 , 60 , and 90 days of initial admission for covid_19 . we considered this composite measure a more complete representation of the outcome of interest than mortality alone as it re ﬂects an out_ come closer to any_site mortality , and given known racial differences in hospice use 4 . statistical_analysis . binary outcomes such as sars_cov_2_infection , hospital admission , composite outcomes such as icu , death , or hospice transfer with andwithout hospitalization that occurred within 30_ , 60_ , and 90 days_post vaccination were considered . a series of multivariable logistic regressions 4were performed to estimate the odds of experiencing events for those vaccinated with mrna_1273compared with bnt162b2 adjusting for risk factors ( demographic , nursing facility admission source , socioeconomic_status ( ses ) index , comorbidities , time of vacci_ nation , residence by state , prior covid diagnosis , and urban/rural location ) . to mitigate any potential selection_bias , sample propensity scores , signaling conditional_probability of receiving mrna_1273_and_bnt162b2 , were estimated via multi_variable generalized_linear_model with logit link function and inverse probability of treatment weights ( iptws ) were calculated using stabilization 5,6 . both weighted univariate and multivariable logistic regressions7–12were performed to validate the ( a ) ahr ( 95 % ci ) t 10 t 30 t 50 t_70 t_90 infection icu/ death/ hospice hospitalization/ icu/ death/ hospice unadjusted and with iptw adjusted_for_imbalances unadjusted and with iptw adjusted_for_imbalances unadjusted and with iptw adjusted_for_imbalances fig . 4 expanded outcomes of vaccination . a adjusted hazard ratios ( ahrs ) along with 95 % con ﬁdence intervals , number needed to vaccinate ( nnv ) , and predicted marginal rates per 1,000 people ( in parenthesis ) of experiencing events at 10d , 30d , 50d , 70d , and 90d post vaccination ( last dose +14d ) for mrna_1273_and_bnt162b2 , respectively . time_to_event for ( top_panel ) infection , ( middle_panel ) serious adverse outcome of icu_admission/ hospitalization/death/transfer_to_hospice , and ( bottom_panel ) adverse outcome of hospitalization/icu_admission/death/transfer_to_hospi ce whichever occurs ﬁrst among all vaccinated individuals . bnumber needed to vaccinate to observe a difference in infection rates between mrna_1273_and_bnt162b2 at 10d , 30d , 50d , 70d , and 90d post vaccination ( last dose +14d ) . note that two models are considered for each outcome .

use in the united_states in december 2020 . with an increase in the supply , vaccines have been distributed to states in phasesthrough various channels , including hospitals , phar_macies , nursing homes , public health departments , and mass vaccination sites in an effort to vaccinate asmuch of the population as possible to reduce morbid_ ity and mortality . large_scale distribution and admin_ istration of vaccines over a short period , particularlyunder extraordinary cold_storage requirements , is acomplex logistical problem.this paper aims to provide information on collect_ ing time_sensitive data on covid_19 vaccine distribu_tion and wastage from the centers for disease controland prevention ( cdc ) , containing the record of everyvaccine shipment to providers in the united statesfrom january 2021 to march 2021 . the data can beanalyzed to understand how distribution decisionsare made across different states , which distribution network structure is used within a state , what types of providers are available , among others . this papersummarizes the collected data , outlines how to usethem , suggests some types of analysis that could bedone with the data , and describes how to access the 1135transportation science vol . 56 , no . 5 , september –october 2022 , pp . 1135 –1147 issn 0041_1655 ( print ) , issn 1526_5447 ( online ) http : //pubsonline.informs.org/journal/trsc data . collecting and archiving time_sensitive data on the vaccination effort in the united_states will assistresearchers and interested parties in studying the dis_ tribution challenges and enable a more ef ﬁcient response to future pandemics or natural or man_madedisasters . in addition , a high_level analysis on vaccinedistribution will be provided and followed by con_cluding remarks and directions for future research using the collected data . 2 . description of covid_19 vaccination system in the united_states in the united_states , the federal government has allo_ cated limited supplies of covid_19 vaccines to threemain types of vaccine awardees , including jurisdictions , federal programs , and federal entities . jurisdictions include states , territories , freely associated states , tribes , or local entities . federal programs include federalretail pharmacy program , health resources and serv_ices administration ’ s ( h r s a ) f e d e r a l l yq u a l i ﬁed com_ munity health center program , federal emergency_management agency ( fema ) community vaccinationcenter ( cvc ) pilot site and mobile vaccination pro_gram , and federal dialysis center program . federal entities include the bureau of prisons , department of defense , indian health service , and veterans healthadministration , each receiving its own vaccine alloca_tion ( centers_for_disease_control and prevention2021a ) . pharmacies and other retailers ( e.g. , cvs , walgreens , costco , and walmart ) may also receive vaccines from jurisdictions . the cdc publishes vac_cine allocation and shipment to jurisdictions . there_fore , the number of vaccines shipped to illinois , as an example , is available ; however , data on shipment to awardees is only available through the data that weare collecting . after allocation , a jurisdiction places vaccine orders in the vaccine tracking system ( vtrcks ) to be shipped to speci_ﬁc locations within the jurisdiction ( bajak and loehrke 2019 , centers_for_disease_control and pre_ vention 2019 ) . doses of p ﬁzer_biontech ( p ﬁzer ) are shipped from a location in michigan . moderna andlater johnson_&_johnson ( janssen ) are shipped through distribution centers managed by mckesson , inc. , a company specializing in distributing pharma_ceuticals and other medical supplies . once vaccines arrive at a location , they can be administered at the same location in most cases ; how_ ever , a secondary distribution may occur in some instances ( e.g. , in north_dakota , as described in theirplanning document , or from commercial pharmaciesto individual locations ) . shipments of p ﬁzer range in size from approximately 1,000 to 5,000 doses ( u.s. department of health and human services 2020 ) , whereas shipments of moderna and janssen are 100doses or more . the cold_chain requirements for each vaccine are outlined in publicly available documents , for example , initially in the cdc interim planningdocuments ( u.s. department of health and human services 2020 ) , then press releases from companies ( pﬁzer_biontech 2020 , janssen 2021 , moderna 2021a ) . initially , a vial of p ﬁzer contained ﬁve doses but later expanded to six ; moderna initially contained ﬁve but later expanded to 10 ( u.s. department of health and human services 2020 ) , 11 , and 15 ; janssen included ﬁve doses ( centers_for_disease_control and preven_ tion2021b ) . vaccine doses are stored until used in most cases . at any point in time , estimates of vaccine inventory may be obtained by pairing the shipment data setwith data on vaccine administrations . in a few cases , wastage occurred , for example , due to breakage , dis_ ruption of the cold_chain requirements , and/or because vaccine vials were opened but not used in their entirety . the cdc authorized the p ﬁzer vaccine for emer_ gency use on december 11 , 2020 , moderna on decem_ ber 18 , 2020 , and janssen on february 27 , 2021 ( bajak and weise 2021 ) . shipments are handled by commer_ cial operators , including fed_ex and ups . auxiliary supplies ( e.g. , syringes , gloves , vaccination cards ) for all vaccines are shipped from the mckesson distribu_ tion centers . the number of doses allocated during theﬁrst months of distribution was primarily pro_rata according to the population in the jurisdiction . our understanding is that the cdc has used estimates ofthe population from the 2019 american community survey data ( u.s. census bureau 2019 ) for the alloca_ tion to jurisdictions . alaska was one exception , wherethe logistics of allocated weekly vaccines would have been more expensive than distributing fewer , larger shipments . allocations are made weekly on mondays for all vaccine types , as shown by the cdc ’ s publicly available allocation data ( centers for disease controland prevention 2021c ) . 3 . u.s. vaccination data landscape the paper ’ s main contribution is to provide a unique and detailed data set that can be used to inform analy_ ses of the covid_19 vaccination campaign to improve decision making in the current and future pandemics . the data set presented in this paper provides detaileddaily vaccine shipment information to vaccine pro_ viders for each u.s. state and territory . this section summarizes data sets related to the covid_19response , especially those that could be linked to our data to facilitate further analyses . the overall landscape of the vaccination data are shown in table 1.t h e r ea r e many data sets in the united_states containing various elements of covid_19 testing and vaccination data , hajibabai et al . : covid_19 data on vaccine shipments 1136 transportation science , 2022 , vol . 56 , no . 5 , pp . 1135 –1147 , © 2022 the

federal entities are available to download from the cdc ( centers fordisease control and prevention 2021c ) . the data set summarizes aggregate doses allocated to a jurisdiction such as a state or local health department and speci_ﬁc large cities . the allocation is available to those entities for ordering . b . administration of vaccine data on vaccine administration can be acquired through the cdc , individual state health department websites , or summaries by thenew york times . publicly available data are aggregated , e.g. , at the county , state , or national level , and it indicates thenumber of doses administered by a particular date . some states , such as north_carolina , provide more detailed data , e.g. , weekly county_level data ( nc department of health andhuman services 2021 ) . some states , such as south carolina , include provider information in administration data ( sc department of health and environmental control 2021 ) . some information is available by age or race_ethnicity , although theavailability of the latter varies by state . c. distribution ( shipment ) of vaccine detailed data such as shipments to speci_ﬁc locations are not generally provided publicly . a rare exception is south carolina , where a state website provides some snapshots ofshipments at some points in time ( sc department of health and environmental control 2021 ) . the data set described in this paper provides distribution data , including shipments tospeciﬁc locations over time . this paper makes these data publicly available . d. wastage of vaccine doses the data set described in this paper provides wastage data of doses for all jurisdictions that report it . e. vaccine distribution and administration guidelines initial guidance to states on vaccine distribution , administration , and reporting can be found in the cdc ’ s covid_19 vaccination program interim playbook for jurisdiction operations ( u.s. department of health and human services2020 , centers_for_disease_control and prevention 2021d ) . f. individual state plans for distribution some state plans for vaccine distribution are publicly available . states were asked to submit initial plans for vaccinedistribution in october 2020 . note that some states posted theirplans publicly but removed them over time . a summary list is available ( michaud et al . 2020 ) . g. inventory of vaccine ( estimated ) the available vaccine inventory by state can be estimated by combining allocation , distribution , and wastage data ( zhangand swann 2021 ) . h. summary of state eligibility for vaccine over time the summary of state vaccination eligibility is publicly available . the data set indicates the eligibility of different populationgroups in each state over time ( boston university 2021 ) . the accuracy may not be 100 % , so researchers are encouraged to check details for a particular state of interest . i . summary of vaccine appointment systems used by states the vaccine appointment summary is publicly available . the summary is compiled by media on how to get covid_19 vaccine in each state , including whether a state has a centralized appointment system , waitlist , call center , or others ( wall_street journal 2021 ) . j . summary of policies at schools or colleges some policies can be obtained from the schools ’ or colleges ’ websites . various websites track schools ( by state and county ) or universities on their mask and vaccine requirements ( burt2021 , thomason and o ’ leary 2021 , zalaznick 2021 ) . k. google covid_19 community mobility reports the mobility reports are available on google ( google 2021 ) . the data set shows how travel patterns in the united_states , different states , or different counties changed due to thecovid_19 pandemic (

the shipment to jurisdiction data are pub_ licly available , shipment to awardee data are only avail_ able through the data we are collecting . figure 3shows the total_number of vaccine doses from each manufac_turer shipped to nonstate/territory awardees . vaccines shipped to a nonstate awardee , for example , bureau of prisons , are not counted in those shipped to the state ( as an awardee ) where the awardee is located . cvs andwalgreens are the two largest nonstate/territory awar_ dees in this period . the pie_chart in figure 3shows the distribution of the total_number of shipped dosesamong different awardees . around 76 % of vaccine doses were shipped to state or territory awardees , 11 % were shipped to either cvs or walgreens , and theremaining 13 % of doses to all other awardees . the shipment data are only available through the data set presented here . the data show that california , texas , cvs , florida , and walgreens were the top ﬁve vaccine awardees that have received 31.6 % of total doses in the united_states . furthermore , cvs , wal_ greens , walmart , rite_aid , and kroger are the top ﬁve pharmacy/grocery stores that have received 15 % oftotal vaccine doses shipped in the january 1 , 2021 – march 31 , 2021 period . it is also worthwhile to note that around 45 % of total doses were shipped to 10 awardees among a total of 92 awardees . 5.2 .

planningmilpdecomposition algorithmabstract this work presents a novel framework to simultaneously address the optimal planning of covid_19 vac__cine supply_chains and the optimal planning of daily vaccinations in the available vaccination centres . anew mixed integer linear_programming ( milp ) model is developed to generate optimal decisions regard_ ing the transferred quantities between locations , the inventory proﬁles of central hubs and vaccination centres and the daily vaccination plans in the vaccination centres of the supply_chain network . speciﬁccovid_19 characteristics , such as special cold_storage technologies , limited shelf_life of mrna vaccines in refrigerated conditions and demanding vaccination targets under extreme time pressure , are aptly modelled . the goal of the model is the minimization of total costs , including storage and transportationcosts , costs related to ﬂeet and staff requirements , as well as , indirect costs imposed by wasted doses . a two_step decomposition strategy based on a divide_and_conquer and an aggregation approach is pro_ posed for the solution of large_scale problems . the applicability and efﬁciency of the proposedoptimization_based framework is illustrated on a study case that simulates the greek nationwide vacci_nation program . finally , a rolling horizon technique is employed to reactively deal with possible distur_ bances in the vaccination plans . the proposed mathematical framework facilitates the decision_making process in covid_19 vaccine supply_chains into minimizing the underlying costs and the number of doseslost . as a result , the efﬁciency of the distribution network is improved , thus assisting the mass vaccina__tion campaigns against covid_19 . /c2112021 elsevier ltd. all

worldwide , more than 160 mil_ lion people have been already infected , while close to 3.5 million passed away . in addition , the necessitated protective measures , and lengthy lockdowns have a severe ﬁnancial impact on the soci_ ety . the urge to rapidly decrease the toll of covid_19 on health and global economy led to the rapid authorization of various vac__cine candidates within a record time . while the focus in the vac__cine world has been on developing the required vaccines and measuring their effectiveness , the struggle to understand and properly address the issues of the vaccine supply_chain ( vsc ) greatly reduces the impact of any vaccination program [ 1 ] . mass vaccination of the world ’ s population will achieve herd_immunity , the ﬁrst step for the progressive transition to the pre_covid_19 normalcy . as a result , the biggest vaccination program in human history is currently in action pushing the covid_19 vsc to its lim_its . furthermore , special characteristics , like limited shelf_life and storage_requirements in freezing conditions , makes its manage_ ment a critical logistical challenge . efﬁcient and effective planning and operation of the supply_chain is crucial for the success of the vaccination program , otherwise , numerous valuable doses will be wasted , and the program ’ s progress will slow down , imposing important ﬁnancial losses . few studies focus on vscs , despite the substantial published research on supply_chain optimization . most related studies are concerned with problems related to the pharmaceutical sector [ 2–8 ] . more recent contributions address key problems of the phar_ maceutical supply_chain , like vehicle routing decisions [ 9,10 ] , uncertainty [ 11 ] , product perishability [ 12 ] and integrated capacity planning and scheduling [ 13 ] , while few recent contributions focused on supply_chains of car t_cell therapies [ 14–16 ] . lately , the scientiﬁc community has shown an increasing interest in vscs [ 17–19 ] , especially on the design/redesign problem of vsc net_ works in developing_countries [ 20–22 ] . two extensive literature reviews on the topic of vscs were recently published [ 23,24 ] . the optimal planning of the supply_chain network has a strongpositive effect on its efﬁciency . therefore , a plethora of mathemat_ ical programming models have been proposed to address this

consider the optimal planning of vscs . chen et al . devel_ oped the ﬁrst planning model for a world_health_organization ’ s expanded program on immunization ( who_epi ) distribution chain in developing_countries [ 28 ] . another study proposed a multi_ objective , multi_period mixed_integer linear_programming ( milp ) model to address the simultaneous optimal_design and planning of sustainable vscs [ 29 ] . trade_offs between the sustainability dimensions considered ( economic , environmental , and social ) are highlighted . recently , yang investigated the optimal_design and operation of who_epi vaccine distribution chains [ 30 ] . the author developed an milp model and a disaggregation_merging technique to generate optimal solutions for real_world cases . recently , kon_ toravdi et al . presented a thoughtful discussion on the production phase of the vaccine [ 31 ] . the distribution phase of the covid_19 supply_chain has not been studied so far . a few contributions focus on the effect of the covid_19 pandemic on other distribution sup_ ply chains [ 32 ] . the covid_19 distribution chain displays specialcharacteristics that differentiate them from other vscs . a promi_ nent concern regarding the distribution of covid_19 vaccines is the strict temperature requirements during transportation and storage . inefﬁcient planning can lead to losses of many valuable doses and thus to increased operational costs . these negative implications are further ampliﬁed due to the enormous scale of the covid_19 vaccination programs . in this work , a new milp model is presented for the optimal short_term planning of the covid_19 supply_chain network . tacti_ cal and operational decisions regarding the inventory levels in the central hubs and vaccination centres , the vaccine ﬂows between the various locations of the distribution network , the ﬂeet require_ ments , the scheduling of citizens ’ vaccinations , as well as , stafﬁng of the vaccination centres are simultaneously considered . the goal of the optimization is the minimization of cost . while previous works have addressed the medium_term vsc planning problem , the developed model is the ﬁrst to

cold_storage technologies , demanding vaccination targets , transportation lead_times and vaccine perishability . moreover , the literature models focus on economic or social objectives and do not take into account the minimization of wasted doses , a critical tar_ get for the effectiveness of the covid_19 vaccination program . in addition to considering the minimization of dose wastage , the developed model is the ﬁrst to simultaneously take optimal short_term decisions for the vsc and planning decisions for the vaccination program in each vaccination centre . integrating these decisions enhances the efﬁciency of the overall vaccination pro_ gram . an milp_based solution strategy is introduced for the efﬁ_ cient solution of large_scale realistic case studies and is successfully applied to a case simulating the greek covid_19 vsc . furthermore , a rolling_horizon technique is incorporated to replan the supply_chain , in case of demand ﬂuctuations originatingfrom citizens that reschedule their vaccination appointment at the last minute or cancel a scheduled appointment . to the best of our knowledge this is one of the ﬁrst contributions that examines the optimal planning of covid_19 vscs by integrating all key planning decisions for the efﬁcient and cost effective realization of the citi_ zens ’ vaccinations program . 2 . problem statement the problem addressed in this work considers the optimal short_term planning of the covid_19 vsc , as well as the optimal planning of appointments in the vaccination centres , in order to minimize the total costs . fig . 1 illustrates a generic representation of the underlying network . the supply_chain consists of three ech_ elons : the manufacturing plants with a known maximum produc_ tion capacity , the hubs , where the vaccine vials are stored and the vaccination centres , where the citizens are vaccinated . the product ( vaccines ) ﬂow is unidirectional , from the manufacturers to the hubs and ﬁnally to the vaccination centres . reverse ﬂows from the vaccination centres to the hubs are not allowed , while intra_ layer ﬂows between the hubs or the vaccination centres are not considered . finally , the vaccines are used in the vaccination pro_ gram of the population . planning of the appointments is consid_ ered simultaneously with the planning the distribution of the covid_19 vaccines . the capacity of the vaccination centres varies according to the employed healthcare personnel . to properly con_ sider the low shelf_life of sensitive vaccines ( 5 days ) , a 14_day hori_ zon is considered . the problem is described in terms of an milp model that relies on a daily discretization of the time horizon . within the given horizon a speciﬁc number of completed appoint_ ments must be satisﬁed . the model distributes them throughout the available periods . as a result , optimal decisions regarding the daily appointments at each centre are generated , which impose the needs in healthcare personnel . four vaccines with different characteristics are studied . in par_ ticular , the vaccines of astrazeneca ( a ) , johnson_&_johnson ( j ) , mod_erna ( m ) and pﬁzer ( p ) are considered . extension to more types of vaccines is straightforward since no changes in the developed model are necessary . rather only an update on the set of vaccines vand all associated data , e.g . storage conditions , shelf_life etc . is required . the hubs are equipped with all necessary cold storagetechnologies for the long_term_storage of the vaccines . more specif_ ically , deep freezers ( /c070/c176c ) are required for pﬁzer and regular freezers ( /c020/c176c ) for moderna vaccines , while simple refrigeration sufﬁces for the non_mrna alternatives ( a and j ) . in contrast , the vaccination centres are only equipped with regular refrigerators . this reinforces the need for the proper organization of the supply_chain , since mrna vaccines , especially the pﬁzer vaccine , can not be maintained long_term in refrigerated conditions . therefore , per_ ishability considerations are included in the proposed milp model . a homogeneous ﬂeet of trucks is employed to transport the vacci_ nes from the hubs to the vaccination centres . the trucks are equipped with dry shippers to maintain low temperatures during transportation and ensure that the cold_chain remains uninter_ rupted . explicit truck capacity limits are not considered , they are matched by the vaccination centre ’ s capacity . vehicle routing isnot considered in this study . it is assumed that in each period a truck can visit a single vaccination centre and must return to the hub from which it started . a daily lead_time is necessary for the transportation of vaccines between the echelons of the supply_chain . an important issue in vscs is related with the wasted doses . this is especially relevant for perishable products like the mrna covid_19 vaccines . the world_health_organization ( who ) catego_ rizes the wasted doses into closed vial wastage , which is caused by inefﬁciencies in the supply_chain and open vial wastage , which is further divided into avoidable and unavoidable open vial wastage [ 33 ] . the ﬁrst is attributed to immunization workers and include errors in patients ’ reactions , suspected contamination , reconstitu_ tion , and excess heat . the latter refers to the discarded doses from multidose vials . closed vial wastage and avoidable vial wastage are included in the model based on the wastage ratios recommended by who , while the minimization of the unavoidable open vial wastage is included in the objective function of the proposed model . the objective of the proposed framework is to determine a ) the transferred amounts and inventory proﬁles in each location , b ) the daily vaccination appointments and the doses wasted due to open vials that are not fully exploited or due to expiration and c ) the needs in healthcare personnel and ﬂeet size to realize the vaccina__tion program , so that the total cost of the supply_chain is mini_ mized . a cost term considers the valuable doses being wasted , while a backlog term is not included , since failing to realize a scheduled appointment is not allowed . finally , the proposed framework examines a mature covid_19 vsc , where vaccine avail_ ability issues have been overcome . 3 . mathematical framework in this chapter the milp_based mathematical frameworks that have been developed to deal with the optimization_problem of planning the covid_19 vsc are presented . 3.1 . milp model the proposed model utilizes a discrete time grid to efﬁciently capture the inventory balances in the various locations of the supply_chain . the constraints related to the material balances , fig . 1 .

carvalho et al . [ 29 ] . in addition to the material bal_ ance , inventory capacity and ﬂow limitation constraints , the pro_ posed model introduces efﬁcient constraints for the incorporation of lead_time , shelf_life limitations and the vaccina__tion plan . the supply limitations provided by the manufacturer are expressed by constraints ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) . more speciﬁcally , constraints ( 1 ) ensure that the vials of vaccine vsupplied by the corresponding manufacturer f ( pf ; v ; t ) throughout the considered planning horizon are limited by the upper bound of production ( pmax h ; v ) . furthermore , it is assumed that each manufacturer fcan supply each hub hat most once per week , as imposed by constraints ( 2 ) . constraints ( 3 ) – ( 7 ) encapsulate the material balances around each location of the supply_chain . firstly , constraints ( 3 ) guarantee that the amount of a vaccine vtransferred from a factory fto all hubs h ( xf ; h ; v ; t ) equals the total amount supplied by the factory in time period t. the next two constraints set the material balances around the hubs . constraints ( 4 ) state that the inventory at the end of the ﬁrst time period equals the initial inventory of the hub ( ah ; v ) plus the amount transferred from the factories , minus the amount that has been sent to the vaccination centres ( xh ; vc ; v ; t ) and the number of vials lost ( lsh ; v ; t ) . for all next time periods , the constraints remain the same , but instead of using the initial inventory , the inventory of the previous period is used . similarly , constraints ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) monitor the material balances around the vaccination cen_ tres . constraints ( 8 ) calculate the vials of vaccine vlost in each location iand time period t. constraints ( 9 ) impose a minimum safety stock at the end of the planning horizon ( ei ; v ) , which is required to ensure the future availability of vaccines in the hubs and the vaccination centres . the storage capacities of the various technologies in the hubs and the vaccination centres are respected by constraints ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) accordingly . the minimum ( qmin i ; j ) and maximum ( qmax i ; jþvial ﬂows between locations are incorporated with constraints ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) . notice that when a connection is not realized in time period t ( yi ; j ; t¼0 ) , the associated transferred quantities ( xi ; j ; v ; t ) are zero . at this point we should note , that while many variables are associated with an integer number of vaccines , e.g . xf , h , v , t , sh , v , t etc. , they are modelled as continuous variables . this is done to allow the prompt generation of optimal decisions . modelling these variables as integer would result to a computationally intractable model even for medium_sized problem instances . to generate integer decisions , one could manually round the non_integer solution extracted by the model . alternatively , the generated non_integer solution can be used as an initial solu_ tion for the same model , but with these variables deﬁned as integer . x f2fvx tpf ; v ; t6pmax h ; v8h ; v ð1þ x t2twyf ; h ; t618f ; h ; w ð2þ x hxf ; h ; v ; t¼pf ; v ; t8f2fv ; v ; t ð3þ sh ; v ; t¼ah ; vþx

transportation time between the supply_chain nodes . theoretically , within the same day a vial could be trans_ ferred from the manufacturers to the hubs and then the vaccina__tion centres to be used . however , this would require a ﬁner discretization of time , thus resulting in large and computationally intractable models . therefore , to ensure the feasibility of the pro_ posed logistics operations using a daily discretization , it is assumed that a vial that is transferred from a manufacturing plant to a hub in period t , can only be further transferred to a vaccination centre after the next period ( t+1 ) . the same holds for the hubs to vacci_ nation centres connections . so , a transportation lead_time of one time period is included in the proposed model . these considera_ tions are introduced to the model through constraints ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) .fig . 2 illustrates the role of the constraint for the vaccination centres . more speciﬁcally , the vials of vaccine vused in the vacci_ nation plan in a vaccination centre for all periods t06t , have to be less than or equal to the initial inventory plus the vials that arrived from the hubs in all periods t006t/c01 , minus the vials lost in the same periods . x vcx t06txh ; vc ; v ; t06ah ; vþx f2fvx t006t/c01xf ; h ; v ; t00 /c0x t006t/c01lsh ; v ; t008h ; v ; t ð14þ x t06tvuvc ; v ; t06avc ; vþx hx t006t/c01xh ; vc ;

vaccination plan of time per_ iodt ( suvc ; v ; t ) . the next constraints connect the total quantity of vials used in the vaccination plan of period t ( vuvc ; v ; t ) , with the newly introduced variables . finally , constraints ( 20 ) calculate the number of vials that belong in the initial inventory and are spoiled ( wei vc ; t ) . xtþksl t0ptþ1lvc ; v ; t ; t0þwe vc ; t¼x h2hvcxh ; vc ; v

, it is assumed that each vaccination line consists of two health workers , that can complete gvaccinations per period . for each vaccination appointment a total of 15 min of registration and monitoring time is necessary , while each vaccina__tion line is active for 6 h. thus , parameter gtakes the value 24 ( 6 h * 4 appointments/h ) in this study . however , the capacity of the vaccination centre is not limited by this value , since each vac_ cination centre comprises of multiple vaccination lines . more speciﬁcally , every vaccination centre has a base number of vaccina__tion lines available ( ivc ) and an additional number of vaccination lines ( ahvc ; t ) can be activated to ensure the feasibility of the opti_mal vaccination plan . the ﬂeet size required for distributing the vaccines from the hubs to the vaccination centres ( nt ) is calculated by constraints ( 26 ) . davc ; t6g/c1hw vc ; t8vc ; t ð24þ ahvc ; tphw vc ; t/c0ivc8vc ; t ð25þ x hx

algorithm is employed . let us assume a relatively small problem with one manufacturing plant , two hubs and 20 vaccination centres . the problem is decomposed employing the following rationale . first , the problem is divided into two sub_ problems , one for each hub , where the vaccination centres are pre_ allocated to the closest hub . this assumption is motivated by the observation that in large problems , the vaccination centres will never be supplied by the hubs that are far away from them . so , this approach does not strongly affect the quality of the solution , how_ ever , it reduces immensely the combinatorial complexity of the problem , since many binary variables ( connections between hubs and vaccination centres ) are predeﬁned . next , the vaccination cen_ tres are grouped into clusters based on existing political bound_ aries . as shown in fig . 3 , four clusters are generated , two for each subproblem . then , the two subproblems are solved using the cluster entities , instead of the vaccination centres . to generate the models , all related parameters of the vaccination centres , e.g . vaccination targets , storage capacities etc . are aggregated to extract the parameters for each cluster . through this aggregated approach , small problems that can be quickly solved are generated.the solution of these models proposes optimal decisions consider_ ing the clusters as the last echelon of the vsc . to disaggregate these decisions an additional step is introduced . here , all binary variables are ﬁxed , and the previous solution is used as a start point for the solver , meaning that in case hub his supplying vacci_ nes to cluster clin time period t ( y h ; cl ; t¼1 ) , then at this time period the hub will supply all vaccination centres of this cluster . since , nog.p . georgiadis and m.c . georgiadis vaccine 39 ( 2021 ) 5302–5312 5306 binary variables are optimized , the model is reduced to an lp model , so it can be solved very fast . conclusively , the proposed solution strategy consists of two steps . in the ﬁrst step , small subproblems are generated , ﬁrst through a divide_and_conquer approach that creates milp_ subproblems for each hub , and then by an aggregation technique that reduces the number of involved entities , by grouping the vac_ cination centres into clusters . at this point the reduced milp_ subproblems are solved to provide optimal solutions for the clus_ ters . in the second step of the algorithm , the binary decisions are ﬁxed , and an lp_model is now solved for all vaccination centres . sequentially , the milp_subproblems for each hub are solved and ﬁnally the optimal plan for the entirety of the supply_chain is created . 3.3 . milp_based replanning algorithm often citizens do not arrive to the planned appointment or reschedule their appointment at the last minute . this is a known issue in covid_19 vscs that must be considered , otherwise the variations between the planned and the actual vaccinations , may result to suboptimal or even infeasible solutions . possible conse_ quences could be the spoilage of numerous doses , the failure of achieving the vaccination targets , the violation of inventory limita_ tions or the miscalculation of the needs in healthcare personnel . therefore , a reactive approach is employed , utilizing the milp_ based solution strategy in the context of a rolling horizon algo_ rithm to ensure that the supply_chain is properly replanned . the introduction of four new subsets tp , tr , tfand tcis required for the implementation of the algorithm . tpdeﬁnes the prediction horizon , which includes all time periods considered by the opti_ mization model at each iteration . in this study a bi_weekly predic_ tion horizon is considered ( tp/c12/c12/c12/c12¼14 ) . fully reoptimizing the plan will provide the best possible solutions in terms of the underlying economic objective ; however , it may require a signiﬁcant number of changes , leading to nervousness , that could not be implemented in practice . therefore , the prediction horizon subset is further divided into two subsets trand tf . the ﬁrst corresponds to the ini_ tial part of the prediction horizon , in which the decisions related tothe binary variables ( yi , j , t ) and the daily number of vaccines used ( vuvc , v , t ) remain ﬁxed and equal to the previous solution . the sec_ ond horizon is more ﬂexible since the previous solution for the variables related to the connections between locations of the sup_ ply chain and the vaccines used is applied as a lower bound . this ensures that the scheduled appointments will not be rescheduled , however more appointments or additional connections are possi_ ble to improve the quality of the plan . the length of these horizons can be freely chosen by the decision_makers based on their speciﬁc goals . in this study , equally length horizons are used ( trjj¼tf/c12/c12/c12/c12¼7 ) , which achieve a good trade_off between nervous_ ness and solution quality . the rest of the variables , e.g . inventory proﬁles , transferred quantities etc. , are fully relaxed throughout the prediction horizon . finally , tccorresponds to the control hori_ zon , that includes all time periods for which the optimized deci_ sions are applied . usually the control horizon is set to a minimal of one time period , which allows the re_optimization of the plan after every time period ( tcjj¼1 ) . the initial state of the supply_chain in a given prediction horizon tp ; hequals to the ﬁnal state of the previous control horizon tc ; h/c01 . at the end of each period the model receives the new information regarding the actual vac_ cination appointments and the new inventory levels at the vacci_ nation centres . let us assume an illustrative example with the following hori_ zon lengths , tp/c12/c12/c12/c12¼14 , trjj¼tf/c12/c12/c12/c12¼7 and tcjj¼1 , with initial time periods ft1 ; : : : ; t14g , ft1 ; : : : ; t7g , ft8 ; : : : ; t14gand ft1gaccordingly . initially the solution strategy computes the optimal plan for tp/c12/c12/c12/c12 . at this point the size of ﬂeet is decided , which is the only decision variable that remains ﬁxed . the plan will be implemented only for period t1 . the information for the actual vaccinations done and the true levels of inventory in the vaccination centres becomes avail_ able at the end of the period . then the horizon rolls and the subsets are updated so that tp¼ft2 ; : : : ; t15gtr¼ft2 ; : : : ; t8gand tf¼ft9 ; : : : ; t15g . using the new information and the previous solu_ tion , the proposed optimization_based solution strategy is employed . this procedure continues iteratively until the ﬁnaliza_ tion of the vaccination program . fig . 4 illustrates the deﬁned hori_ zons for four consecutive iterations of the rolling horizon algorithm.fig . 3 . decomposition approach.g.p . georgiadis and m.c . georgiadis vaccine 39 ( 2021 ) 5302–5312 5307 the implementation of this algorithm incorporates uncertain_ ties of the covid_19 supply_chain related to the differences between the planned and the actual appointments in the mod_ elling approach . thus , the decision_makers can deal with such uncertainties and constantly improve the extracted plans using the current state of the supply_chain . decisions related to trans_ ferred quantities , employed healthcare personnel and inventories can be promptly adjusted to include any new information , ensur_ ing the success of the vaccination program , while minimizing the total operational costs . 4 . results in this section the developed optimization_based framework is tested . first , an illustrative example is used to test in detail the efﬁ_ ciency of the proposed milp_model . then , a large_scale problem that simulates the greek covid_19 vsc is studied and near_ optimal planning decisions are generated by employing the pro_ posed milp_based solution strategy . finally , the applicability of the replanning algorithm is illustrated even for extreme distur_ bances in the vaccination plan . all models and solution algorithms were developed using the gams 30.1 interface and all instances were solved in an intel core i7 @ 3.4gz with 16 gb ram using the commercial solver cplex [ 34 ] . 4.1 . illustrative example let us assume a covid_19 supply_chain consisting of one hub and ﬁve vaccination centres . two vaccine types ( p and m ) are avail_ able , supplied by two manufacturing plants . each plant is exclu_ sively producing and supplying to the hubs only one vaccine type . all related data e.g . storage capacities , vaccination goals , dis_ tances etc . are provided in the supplementary material ( tables s1– s5 ) . the pﬁzer_type vaccine can be stored for up to 5 days in the vaccination centres , while perishability constraints are not enforced on the moderna_type vaccine , whose shelf_life in refriger_ ated conditions ( 30 days ) greatly exceeds the bi_weekly planning horizon . the developed milp model is employed to minimize the total cost for the distribution of the vaccines and the planning of the vaccination program in the vaccination centres . within 30 cpu sec_ onds , an optimal solution with a minimum cost of 22,059 rmus1is generated . the most signiﬁcant costs are associated with the opera_ tion of the storage technologies , especially the freezers and deep freezers in the hubs . in particular , 59.8 % of the total costs originatefrom storing the vaccines in the hubs and 19.1 % are due to storage costs in the refrigerators of the vaccination centres . thus , inventory costs comprise the 78.9 % of the total cost , emphasizing the impor_ tance of generating decisions that optimize the inventory proﬁles of the supply_chain . fuel costs , drivers ’ wages , and rental of the trucks , cover 3.8 % , 9.3 % and 6.1 % of the total cost accordingly . only 26 doses are lost translating to 1.8 % of the total costs . no additional healthcare personnel are required ; therefore , the associated cost term is zero . table 1 reports the number of vaccine vials stored in the hub and the vaccination centres throughout the considered hori_ zon ( si ; v ; t ) . further detailed results on the vials transferred ( xi ; j ; v ; t ) , the vials opened ( vui i ; v ; t ) , the doses used ( du i ; v ; t ) , the daily appoint_ ments ( da i ; t ) , the solution statistics and the cost distribution can be found in tables s6–s11 of the supplementary material . 4.2 . large_scale study case : the greek covid_19 vsc to evaluate the developed milp_based framework for realisti_ cally sized covid_19 vscs , the problem of the panhellenic vaccina__tion program is simulated . the greek state is using ﬁve hubs in total , whose exact locations are unknown due to security reasons . however , it is known that two are in the region of attica , one in thessaloniki , one in karditsa and one in crete . based on this knowl_ edge the locations of the hubs are approximately chosen . the hos_ pitals and health centres of greece as provided by the hellenic ministry of health are used as vaccination centres . except for crete , which has its own hub , greek islands are not considered in the study . as a result , a total of 351 vaccination centres are considered . four vaccine types are available ( p , m , a , j ) each one produced and supplied exclusively by a single manufacturing plant . to create the required data , the population data of greece from the population and housing census conducted by the hellenic statistical author_ ity are used [ 35 ] . the population is divided based on the regional unit and the vaccination centres are allocated to their respective regional unit . to generate the vaccination targets for the consid_ ered horizon of 14 days , it is assumed that the vaccination program for the entirety of the population must be realized within 6 months . so , the total demand for each vaccination centre is divided by 12 to get the bi_weekly vaccination targets . to ensure the feasibility of the problem , the initial inventory in the hubs and the vaccination centres is enough to satisfy at least the vaccination demand of the ﬁrst two time periods . vaccine inventories in the manufactur_ ing plants are not considered as they are irrelevant for the problem under consideration . the problem above is solved by employing the proposed milp_ based solution strategy . each vaccination centre is allocated to a single hub based on the geographical criteria . for the aggregationstep of the solution algorithm , the 351 vaccination centres are grouped into 54 clusters based on their regional unit . detailed data of the considered problem instance e.g . maximum vaccine supply , distance_matrix , hub to vaccination centres connectivity and vacci_ nation centres to clusters allocation , are provided in tables s12– s17 of the supplementary material . to generate near_optimal solu_ tions for the entirety of the supply_chain , ﬁve individual subprob_ lems , one for each hub are solved . first the clusters are considered , and aggregate solutions are proposed and then the detailed solu_ tions for all vaccination centres of the subproblems are generated . the solver terminates either when the computational time limit of one hour ( 3600 s ) is exceeded , or when an optimality gap of 5 % is achieved . table 2 portrays the solution statistics for all iterations of the individual subproblems . it is shown that the computational time limit is reached for the more complicated cases ( h1 , h2 and h3 ) in the ﬁrst step of the solution strategy . however , the optimal_ ity gaps achieved are very close to the desired target of 5 % . this tar_ get has been chosen , since a solution with a proven optimality gapfig . 4 . replanning via a rolling horizon approach . 1relative monetary unitsg.p . georgiadis and m.c . georgiadis vaccine 39 ( 2021 ) 5302–5312 5308 of 5 % can be considered as optimal . it must be noticed that for these cases relatively good optimality gaps ( 15–20 % ) were achieved in very low cpu times , of around 15 min , displaying the model ’ s capability of quickly proposing good solutions for complex problems . on the contrary , subproblems h4 and h5 are promptly solved to optimality . the time required for the second step is very low in comparison . even the most difﬁcult subproblem ( h1 ) is resolved within three minutes . comparing the problem sizes of the ﬁrst and second step it is observed that the aggregated approach signiﬁcantly reduces the number of variables and equa_ tions , which makes feasible the consideration of large and complex problem instances . the computational time required in total is close to 3.5 h , however the utilization of parallel_computing tech_ niques reduces it to around 1 h. optimal solutions are generated for the smaller subproblems , while larger , more difﬁcult subprob_lems may not be solved to optimality , but the reported integrality gaps ( < 8 % ) , signify a solution close to the optimal one ( 5 % ) . fig . 5 displays the distribution of the various cost terms for the study case of greece . similar conclusions to the ones for the illus_ trative example can be drown . storage costs in the hubs and the vaccination centres are the most signiﬁcant terms , comprising together the 78 % of the total costs . next come the transportation costs , more speciﬁcally the wage of the drivers ( 9 % ) , the cost of renting the trucks ( 8.4 % ) and the cost of fuel ( 3.8 % ) . finally , very few doses are lost ( 0.7 % ) , while extra healthcare workers are rarely required ( 0.3 % ) . the precise cost distribution for each of the ﬁve subproblems solved are provided in table s18 of the supplemen_ tary material . fig . 6 illustrates the inventory proﬁles in each of the hubs and aggregated for all vaccination centres . it is noticed that the stored amounts are sustained relatively low to reduce as much as possible the storage costs . this is especially evident for the pﬁzer_type and moderna_type vaccines , which consistently do not remain in storage , rather they are used as fast as possible.this is expected since the mrna vaccines are stored using special technologies that impose high operational costs . the stored amounts are increased in the end of the horizon to satisfy safety stock requirements . low quantities of pﬁzer_type vaccine are observed in the inventory proﬁles of the vaccination centres which ensure that the vaccines are not spoiled due to perishability issues . moreover , the inventories of the vaccination centres at the end of saturdays ( time periods 6 and 13 ) are practically zero since it is assumed that no vaccinations are done on sundays . in the presented example the vaccination centres have been grouped based on political boundaries . however , different cluster_ ing methods could be applied in other vsc problems . to address the impact the number of clusters employed have in the quality of the solutions generated , the following sensitivity_analysis is included . employing the proposed solution strategy , a large_sizedproblem of 106 vaccination centres is considered . a total of six instances are solved , considering alternative grouping of the vacci_table 1 stored vials in the hub and in the vaccination centres ( s i , j , t ) .

expected , using less clusters results to smaller milp models in the ﬁrst step . therefore , the aggregated solution extracted is closer to the theoretically optimal , since smaller inte_ grality gaps are achieved . however , aggregating the vaccination centres into fewer clusters , leads to worse solutions , when dealing with the real vsc problem . in particular , the generated lp model in the second step leads to worse detailed solutions for the vaccina__tion centres . interestingly , using 10 or 11 clusters in the studiedexample results to infeasibly solutions . therefore , extremely aggregating the vaccination centres into very few clusters shouldbe strongly avoided . conclusively , the maximum number of clus_ ters , that respects the comptutational time limitations , should be selected . 4.3 . replanning the covid_19 vsc in this subsection the problem of replanning the covid_19 vsc in case of disturbances due to citizens not arriving to scheduledappointments is studied . the case study used replicates the sub_ problem of hub h1 from the greek nationwide problem presented in the previous section . first , the model is solved for the initial 14_ day horizon . at the end

following information . all scheduled appointments were completed in only 26 vaccination centres . in 15 of them 5 % of the appointments were not realized , while 10 % and 15 % of the citizens did not arrive in the appointments in 44 and 21 vaccina__tion centres accordingly . similarly , in the second period , the per_ centage of unrealized appointments was 2 % in 45 , 8 % in 11 and 12 % in 30 vaccination centres , while on the third period these were 4 % in 30 , 10 % in 40 and 25 % in 6 vaccination centres . those distur_ bances call for the immediate replanning of the supply_chain since the actual inventory proﬁles are signiﬁcantly different to the planned ones . therefore , when the new information becomes available , the proposed solution strategy is employed to reactively replan the supply_chain . the cost distribution after every iteration of the solution algorithm is shown in table 4 . it is observed that despite the signiﬁcant disturbances , the costs remain low . interest_ ingly , very few doses are wasted , while storage costs are not increased , showing the ﬂexibility of the proposed solutions in case of unexpected disturbances , as well as the efﬁciency of the reactive strategy . an interesting observation can be made regarding thewasted doses , the large majority of which are astrazeneca_type vaccines . very few pﬁzer_type and johnson & johnson_type vacci_ nes are spoiled , while nearly no moderna_type vaccines are wasted . the model correctly prioritizes the use of the costly mrna vaccines , although very few pﬁzer_type vaccines are lost due to their limited shelf_life and choses to waste the least expensive alternative ( astrazeneca_type vaccines ) . detailed information on the wasted doses per iteration are given in table s19 of the supple_ mentary material . 5 . conclusions in this work , the optimal planning of the covid_19 vsc is con_ sidered . speciﬁc problem characteristics , such as special cold stor_ age requirements , extremely limited shelf_life of some vaccine types in refrigerated conditions and the unprecedented time pres_ sure for the realization of the vaccination program , differentiates it from other similar supply_chain problems . to the best of our knowledge , this is the ﬁrst work to address the planning problemof the covid_19 vaccine distribution chain . in addition , we extend this study by integrating decisions on optimally planning the daily vaccination program in every vaccination centre . a novel milp model is developed to tackle this integrated problem . the model ’ s efﬁciency is ﬁrst shown in an illustrative example . optimal deci_ sions leading to the minimization of cost are generated in very low cpu times . furthermore , a decomposition strategy extends the applicability of the model on realistically sized problems . a simulated instance of the greek covid_19 vsc is used to illustrate the capabilities of the proposed framework . decisions on trans_ ferred quantities , inventory proﬁles , transportation , and staff requirements , as well as , daily vaccination plans , for a nationwide problem , are optimally taken in low cpu times . finally , a reactive approach that utilizes a rolling horizon algorithm is proposed to handle uncertainties related to unexpected disturbances in the daily vaccination plan of the vaccination centres . possible future research directions could be the consideration of more sophisti_ cated clustering methods and the inclusion of vehicle routing deci_sions , through a metaheuristic , e.g . variable neighbourhood search , approach . credit authorship contribution statement georgios p. georgiadis : conceptualization , methodology , soft_ ware , investigation , visualization , writing – original draft . michael c.

then compared the results with rct data . we then “ extrapolated ” the consistency and further ranked the covid_19 vaccines regarding rare but severe aes , including shingles , hearing_impairment , thrombosis , facial paralysis , anaphylaxis , pulmonary_embolism , myocarditis , and gbs . though these aes have drawn more public attention and may result in more severe out _ comes , they were not explicitly evaluated in the rcts due to the rarity of events and/or short follow_up . results we extracted 569,072 reports submitted to v aers related to covid_19 vaccines from december 14 , 2020 to september 17 , 2021 . after excluding 1952 entries reporting co_administration with other vaccines , 1198 reports with an unknown manufacturer , and 6297 reports without associated symptoms ; 559,717 reports were used for analysis , including 237,735 for the pfizer , 270,754 for the moderna , and 51,228 for the janssen vaccines . the characteristics of these v aers reports are presented in table 1 . v aers reports were more common after administration of the janssen vaccine ( 3.40 per 1000 doses ) than pfizer or moderna vaccines ( 1.06 or 1.79 per 1000 doses , respectively ) . fewer reports were related to the elderly population ( 60 + ) after janssen vaccine ( 17.4 % ) , compared to moderna ( 35.4 % ) and pfizer ( 25.0 % ) . females were much more likely to submit v aers reports than males , irrespective of vaccine type . the aes reported were slightly more likely to occur on the same day as vaccination for the pfizer vaccine ( 41.9 % , compared to 36.7 % and 36.6 % for moderna and janssen respectively ) . more reports were related to the first dose than the second dose for pfizer ( 50.6 % vs 34.7 % ) and moderna ( 60.2 % vs 26.3 % ) vaccines . the main results are presented in table 2 , which contains the risks of aes after covid_19 vaccination as reported in either rcts or v aers , and the rank of vaccines and their consistency . the risks of aes after covid_19 vaccination as reported in v aers are also shown in fig . 1 . as expected , the ae risks from system _ atically observed rcts ( the first rows ) are substantially different than the ae risks spontaneously reported in the v aers database ( the second rows ) . however , the rank order of vaccine aes are highly consistent between rcts and v aers , especially for systemic aes . specifically , for pfizer and moderna vaccines , the reporting risks of systemic aes after the first dose are always lower than those after the second dose in either rcts or v aers . results based on age_groups are presented in tables s1 and s2 in the supplementary materials . in general , the ae risks for elderly population is slightly lower than young population , while the rank of vaccines remains to be consistent for each of the two age_groups . table 2 also reports the ranks of vaccines for other rare but severe aes available in v aers but not in rct data . to this end , v aers provided large_scale

excessive risk of thrombosis after the janssen vaccine resulted in a 10_day suspension ( april 13 to april 23 ) of its administration in april 2021 . the excessive reporting risk of gbs after janssen vaccine was also reported by several studies11,12 . for shingles , the v aers data suggested that the 1st shot of moderna vaccine was associated with the highest reporting risk , followed by the 2nd shot of moderna vaccine . for myocarditis , higher reporting risks was observed for the second dose of pfizer and moderna vaccines . there are some post_marketing studies on myocarditis after covid_19 vaccination13,14 but no comparison between vaccines exists . for anaphylaxis higher reporting risks were observed for the first dose of pfizer vaccine . one study8 showed that the incidence of anaphylaxis associ _ ated with the pfizer vaccine is higher than other non_covid vaccines , but no comparison among covid_19 vaccines exist . there were no substantial differences among vaccines regarding risks of other aes ( fig . 1 ) . we emphasize that the rank consistency for local and systemic aes adds credibility to the relative safety among multiple vaccines for the rare but severe aes , and this is a unique contribution of our study . in sensitivity analyses examining temporal changes on reporting risk we found decreasing risks of mild and common aes such as pain and fever ( fig . s1a , b ) , and increasing risks of more severe and rare aes such as thrombosis and gbs ( fig . s1c , d ) . the ranking of vaccines remained stable , and the correlations show consist_ ency ( i.e .

strengths . first , our study investigated the evidence consistency by comparing safety signals across multi_source data . the consistency in evidence across datasets is an important component of evidence quality , which can not be obtained using a single dataset . second , severe aes are better monitored by post_marketing data than rcts . our analysis using v aers provides valuable evidence of the relative safety of the covid_19 vaccines regarding severe aes , and circumvents the reporting bias of the spontaneous report _ ing system . our study has several limitations . first , our analysis focuses on the comparison across vaccines , and evidence from rcts and v aers , but does not provide information on absolute incidences of aes among the general popu_ lation . also , the risk calculations in rcts and v aers do not take into account background risks in the reporting populations . second , as a spontaneous reporting system , reporting into v aers varies over time and is subject to shifts in the population undergoing vaccination and to publicity stimulation , hence the inherent limitations/ biases when using v aers data for vaccine safety evaluation . for example , before vaccines were available to the general public , they were administered according to scheduled phases depending on age , occupation , and living situation ; aes and reporting practices may vary accordingly . these novel vaccines drew extraordinary public attention , especially when first administered , which may also affect reporting practices . third , our study only includes three pivotal rcts1–4 for the three vaccines but more trials may be included in the future . furthermore , it lacks comparison with other safety systems such as the biologics effectiveness and safety ( best15 ) , the safety platform for emergency vaccines ( speac16 ) , the clinical immunization safety assessment ( cisa17 ) project and the vaccine safety datalink ( vsd18 ) . the current investigation is less robust unless more trials and safety surveillance databases are included in the comparison . the validity of this study is largely dependent on the assumption that the reporting behavior to v aers ( i.e . reporting sensitivity19 ) is similar across different type of vaccines . this assumption is likely to be the case for pfizer and moderna vaccines , as they were authorized and became available at similar times . however , the janssen vaccine was authorized about 3 months later and could have drawn less public attention . it is thus possible that people with only mild aes after the janssen vaccine may have chosen not to report to v aers and as a result , the risks of more severe , systemic aes is higher than those after pfizer and moderna vaccines . this could explain the inconsistency of the rank of janssen vaccine between rct and v aers regarding systemic aes in table 2 . we have previously seen such an example in our evaluation of gbs as a potential post_vaccination effect after influenza vaccines6 , where people who reported gbs tend not to report mild aes , such as pain , erythema and swelling etc . post_market surveillance is essential for continuously evaluating and monitoring vaccine safety . in addition to v aers , other active surveillance databases such as best15 , speac16 , cisa17 and vsd18 have been used for evaluating the safety of covid_19 vaccines7,20–22 . in general , data collected by surveys23,24 or social_media platforms25,26 could also provide evidences for vaccine safety or hesitancy . despite the limitation of being a pas_ sive reporting system , v aers , with proper statistical analyses , still provides valuable information about vaccine safety , especially in the early phase of general population administration and vaccine surveillance . for example , in the first several months ( dec 2020–april 2021 ) of the pfizer and moderna covid_19 vaccine administration , v aers_based studies5,8–10 emerged to generate safety signals for anaphylaxis , sudden hearing_loss and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis . these studies contribute unique time_sensitive real_world evidence on safety signals that were examined rigorously by later randomized studies . our study provides a novel method utilizing the publicly available rct and v aers data for monitoring the safety of covid_19 vaccines . it is reassuring that our analyses based on the v aers data produced evidence consistent with existing rcts , and demonstrated the ability to identify rare aes that were not recognized in the rcts . our analysis can be applied to the post_market surveillance of ongoing ( e.g . covid_19 vaccine boost dose and adolescent dose ) and future vaccine administra_ tion using v aers , especially for the severe aes . the website https : // chong liang_ luo . shiny apps . io/ covid_ vaers/ will be continuously updated for timely monitoring the covid_19 vaccines in the future . methods data sources . we collected vaccine safety data from published rcts for the three vaccines authorized in the u.s. for all rcts1–4 , local aes ( i.e . pain , erythema and swelling ) and systemic aes ( i.e . headache , fever , chill , fatigue , nausea/vomiting , arthralgia/joint_pain , and myalgia/muscle pain ) were assessed within seven days after vaccination . we also used data from v aers27–29 to seek post_marketing evidence on the safety of the three vaccines . the v aers data is publicly available and no institutional approval is required . the analyses were performed in accordance with v aers guidelines and regulations27 . we extracted ae reports after covid_19 vaccination up to september 17 , 2021 . detailed definitions of the aes in meddra preferred term ( pt ) level are listed in table s1 . we grouped some of the similar pt terms to their standardized meddra queries ( smqs ) 30 . reports with co_ administration with other vaccines , or unknown manufacturer of covid_19 vaccine , or invalid symptoms ( e.g . “ no adverse_events ” ) were excluded . to be consistent with the rcts , we used v aers reports with age 18 + ( age 16 + for the pfizer vaccine ) , and onset time within 7 days after vaccination for the solicited aes ( i.e . local and systemic aes ) . for the unsolicited aes ( i.e . other rare but severe aes including shingles , hearing_impairment including tinnitus , thrombosis , facial paralysis including bell ’ s palsy , anaphylaxis , pulmonary_embolism , myo_ carditis , and gbs ) , we used v aers reports with onset time within 42 days after vaccination . analysis was also repeated for age_groups , i.e . young and elderly populations . we used the age cutoffs from the original trials ( i.e . 55 for pfizer trial , 65 for moderna trial and 60 for janssen trial ) for the rcts , and 60 for v aers . statistical_analysis . the vaccines and doses were grouped in 5 categories , i.e . pfizer_1st ( p1 ) , pfizer_2nd ( p2 ) , moderna_1st ( m1 ) , moderna_2nd ( m2 ) and janssen ( j ) . figure 2 illustrates the overall rationale of our 6 vol : . ( 1234567890 ) scientific reports | ( 2022 ) 12:10946 | https : //doi.org/10.1038/s41598_022_13809_7 www.nature.com/scientificreports/statistical_analysis plan using data from rcts and v aers . we calculated ae risks for each vaccine type and dose in v aers . since the aes are self_reported in the v aers database , ae risks are not directly comparable to event risks in the rcts . however , a unique opportunity in our investigation of v aers data on covid_19 vaccines is that the pfizer and moderna vaccines were released around the same time and both have received similar public attention . thus , it is reasonable to assume that the reporting behavior of aes is not strongly dependent on the type of vaccine received by the vaccinee . under this assumption , despite the v aers data being subject to report_ ing bias , a similar reporting risk applies to both vaccinees , hence the ranks of ae reporting risks across vaccines calculated from v aers are meaningful statistics , which can be cross_compared with the ranks of ae risks across vaccines calculated from rcts . figure 2 . covid_19 vaccine safety study from three randomized controlled trials1–4 ( rcts ) and the cdc vaccine adverse_event reporting system ( v aers ) . five groups are compared , i.e . pfizer_1st ( p1 ) , pfizer_2nd ( p2 ) , moderna_1st ( m1 ) , moderna_2nd ( m2 ) and janssen ( j ) . rank consistency is shown between rcts and v aers regarding local and systemic adverse_events ( aes ) , including pain , erythema , swelling , headache , fever , chill , fatigue , nausea/vomiting , arthralgia and myalgia . the evidence is extended to study the other severe and rare aes including shingles , hearing_impairment , thrombosis , facial paralysis , anaphylaxis , pulmonary_embolism , myocarditis , and gbs

//doi.org/10.1038/s41598_022_13809_7 www.nature.com/scientificreports/given the above rationale , we compared ae ranking by vaccine in both the v aers and rct databases , and evaluated their consistency . the rank consistency was measured by the spearman ’ s rank correlation_coefficient ρ31 . spearman ’ s ρ ranges from − 1 to 1 and a positive value indicates consistency of the two ranks . this rank cor _ relation measure is commonly used to assess agreement between two rating approaches . finally , based on the consistency between rcts and v aers , we further ranked the vaccines regarding the risks of other rare but severe aes ( i.e . shingles , hearing_impairment including tinnitus , thrombosis , facial paraly_ sis including bell ’ s palsy , anaphylaxis , pulmonary_embolism , myocarditis , and gbs ) in v aers . data availability the rct data analyzed in this study are available from the published papers1–4 ; the v aers data are publically available from https : // vaers
