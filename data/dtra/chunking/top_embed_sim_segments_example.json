                "# Strengthen the communication between intelligence agencies and major research universities Conclusion In December 2008, the US Commission on the Preven- tion of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism released a report, World At Risk, reporting that \"it is more likely than not that a weapon of mass destruc- tion will be used in a terrorist attack somewhere in the world by the end of 2013\", and that \"terrorists are more likely to be able to obtain and use a biological weapon than a nuclear weapon.\" A myriad of economic, technical and political factors are contributing to the elusive and rapidly evolving nature of the biological weapons threat. The dual-use nature of biotechnology and the globaliza- tion of the biotechnology industry has made regulation of materials that can be used for biological weapons prolif- eration cost-prohibitively expensive and laborious.",
