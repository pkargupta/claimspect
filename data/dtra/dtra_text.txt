ICAO Annex 19 'Safety Management' TE.GEN.00409-001 Outline The case for Safety Management ICAO Annex 19 ICAO Annex 19 Part I The case for Safety Management ICAO Annex 19 ICAO Annex 19 Concept of safety What is safety Zero accidents (or serious incidents)? Freedom from danger or risks? Error avoidance? Regulatory compliance? ... ? Controlled risk and controlled error is acceptable in an inherently safe system. Safety is a systems property, it can only be determined for the whole system under consideration. Safety constraints need to be enforced at all system levels. SMS provides the framework for this to happen in a systematic way.

Global rate of accidents involving passenger fatalities per 100 million passenger miles, scheduled commercial air transport operations, excluding acts of unlawful interference Why do we need to do more? Fast pace of technological change - new business models Changing nature of accidents * New types of hazards - emergence of organisational accidents Reduced ability to learn from experience * time to market for new products has greatly decreased Increasing complexity and coupling of system 'components' * cause and effect are less and less related in a direct/linear way More complex relationships between humans and automation, role of software Changing regulatory and public views (perception) on safety Organisational accidents The immediate cause of many accidents is identified as human or technical failure, but these in turn usually stem from organisational failures which are the responsibility of management. "Individual accidents are by far the larger in number. Organisational accidents are comparatively rare, but often catastrophic, events that occur within complex modern technologies." "Organisational accidents have multiple causes involving many people operating at different levels of their respective companies...Organisational accidents are the product of recent times, or more specifically, a product of technological innovations which have radically altered the relationship between systems and their human elements." James Reason, Managing the Risk of Organizational Accidents, Ashgate publishing, 1997. ICAO Annex 19 What is a safety management system (SMS)? Processes Decision- Making Safety risk The predicted probability and severity of the consequences or outcomes of a hazard. Risk Hazard A condition that could cause or contribute to an aircraft incident or accident. A series of defined, organisation-wide processes that provide for effective risk-based decision- making related to a company's daily business. ICAO Annex 19 Key processes of an SMS Hazard identification * A method for identifying hazards related to the whole organisation (operational + systemic hazards) Safety reporting * A process for the acquisition of safety data not only related to product safety Risk Management * A standard approach for assessing risks and for applying risk controls Performance Measurement * Management tools for analysing how effectively the organisation's safety goals are being achieved Safety Assurance * Processes based on quality management principles that support continual improvement of the organisation's safety performance ICAO Annex 19 QMS versus SMS Both QMS and SMS promote systems approach and continual improvement. QMS and SMS may use the same tools and techniques: e.g. performance monitoring - Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), management of business risks, process mapping / system and process analysis, auditing, surveys. An effective QMS will support the implementation of effective safety management processes. BUT Quality management systems (QMS) are geared towards customer expectations and contractual/regulatory obligations. SMS is about identifying hazards and managing risks. Processes designed to produce a quality product/service alone will not guarantee safety (safety is a systems property, not a component property). ICAO Annex 19 Part II The case for Safety Management ICAO Annex 19 ICAO Annex 19 Starting point: ICAO High-level Safety Conference 2010 RECOMMENDATION 2/5: ICAO should develop, in close collaboration with States, international and national organizations, a new Annex dedicated to safety management responsibilities and processes which would address the safety management responsibilities of States framed under the State Safety Programme (SSP). In response to the HLSC 2010 recommendation, the ICAO Air Navigation Commission recommended that the new Annex be developed in two phases: * Phase 1 involved the consolidation of existing safety management provisions previously contained in as many as 6 different Annexes, into a single new Annex. * The development of enhanced requirements is the focus of Phase 2 that started in November 2012. * The first amendment of Annex 19 Edition 1 is scheduled for November 2016. It will then follow a three- year amendment cycle.

The survey results have shown that Ukrainian and Russian researchers continue carrying out joint research in major international projects. However, a decrease in the number of works published by Ukrainian and Russian research institutions in 2016 has testified to an adverse impact of Russia's mili- tary aggression on cooperation in the field of science. The findings are important for preparing the science development programs in Ukraine. K e y w o r d s: scientific cooperation, publication activity, bibliometric analysis, Ukraine, and Russia Collaboration among researchers from differ- ent countries simplifies acquiring of new knowl- edge, expands opportunities for further use of re- search results, and facilitates the effective sharing of skills, competences, and resources. The Ukrai- nian science has directly suffered from the Crimea occupation by the armed forces of the Russian Federation in 2014 and the subsequent Russian armed aggression in the east of Ukraine. The em- ployees of research institutions and higher edu- cational establishments of Crimea and Donbass were forced to evacuate, while most equipment and materials for research remained in the occu- pied territories [1]. In addition, under conditions of undeclared war between Ukraine and Russia, the scientists of both countries, due to objective and subjective reasons, may not be interested in establishment, continuation, and development of further coop- (c) NAZAROVETS, S.A., 2017 eration that would be mutually beneficial in peacetime. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to study the impact of Russian military interven- tion in Ukraine on the joint scientific activities of Ukrainian and Russian researchers by means of bibliometric analysis of co-authored scholarly re- search publications issued by Ukrainian and Rus- sian institutions in 2014--2016. As a rule, the co-authored publications by re- searchers from different countries have more quotes than those issued by authors from one country [2]. Thus, the researchers are interested in publishing works in co-authorship with foreign partners, because it stimulates the growth of the readership and the world recognition of their contribution to the development of science. The results of previous studies indicate that Ukraine belongs to Russia's main scientific partners and, Russia is an important scientific partner of Ukraine. At the same time, for both countries this partnership is not the top-priority, as Ukrainian and Russian researchers work much more effec- tively with colleagues from other countries. ber of applications, with 288 projects of Ukrainian and Russian researchers scoring a success [4]. Nazarovets, S.A. An analysis of the scientific publications of Russian researchers issued in international co- authorship in 1999--2008 has shown that Ukraine is the only out of all post-Soviet countries among the top twenty countries: it was ranked the 12th in 1999--2003 and 15th in 2004--2008; the share of joint publications of Ukrainian and Russian scholars in the total number of Russian publica- tions co-authored with international colleagues made up 3.7%, in 1999--2003, and 3.8%, in 2004-- 2008 [5, 13--14]. The dynamics of main indica- tors of publication activity and the citation of Russian scientific publications in 1996--2010 have shown that the share of Russian publica- tions co-authored with Ukrainian scientists ac- counted for 5.4%, in 2010 [6]. Also, upon the results of interviews with ex- perts and science advisers to foreign embassies to Russia, as well as with representatives of leading Russian universities and research organizations, Ukraine has been listed among the most promis- ing countries for the development of internation- al R&D cooperation for the next 5--10 years [7]. So far, no general analysis of international co- operation with Ukrainian scientists involved has been made, and domestic bibliometric studies of academic collaborations have been limited to in- dividual research areas. The scientometric analy- sis of international cooperation of Ukraine in the socio-humanitarian field has shown that the most active Ukrainian researches collaborate with col- leagues from the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom; whereas, they have much fewer common publications with Russian socio- humanist researchers [3]. In the context of Ukrainian-Russian scientific cooperation it should be noted that many compe- titions for fundamental research projects and their further implementation have been conducted jointly by the State Fund for Fundamental Re- search of Ukraine (SFFR) and the Russian Fund for Fundamental Research (RFFR). The compe- titions were marked with a record-breaking num- The joint scientific publications of researchers affiliated in Ukraine and Russia were searched on April 13, 2017, in the Scopus abstract database that provides the most complete overview of the research results in various scientific disciplines. The two types of scientific papers, the articles and the conference proceedings, (ProceedingsPa- per) for the period of 2007--2016 were consid- ered. The search was initially conducted in the Affiliationcountry field that should contain the word "Ukraine" to indicate that the author was employed at a Ukrainian institution. Then, docu- ments of the Ukrainian researchers made in co- operation with Russian colleagues (LIMIT-TO (AFFILCOUNTRY, "RussianFederation")) were selected. Also, an additional search was conduct- ed for the selection of documents co-authored by researchers of Ukraine and Russia only. For the period of 2007--2016, 7840 documents (6655 articles and 1185 proceeding papers) co- authored by the staff of Ukrainian and Russian institutions are found. The number of these joint works of Ukrainian and Russian scholars includes publications with other foreign colleagues en-vitnemukod'tsik'liK Fig. 1.

The most productive fields of Ukrainian-Russian cooperation in 2007--2016, in accordance with Scopus classification gaged, among which the largest share belongs to researchers from USA (1857 publications), Fran- ce (1654 publications), Poland (1599 publica- tions), Italy (1561 publications), and Great Brit- ain (1539 publications). Only 3631 documents (3030 articles and 601 proceedings) are published by researchers from Ukrainian and Russian R&D institutions (Fig. 1). The most productive institutions in terms of the number of publications co-authored exclu- sively by Ukrainian and Russian researchers are as follows: the Russian Academy of Sciences (491 publications), the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (387 publications), the Lomonosov Moscow State University (331 publications), the Karazin Kharkiv National University (230 pa- pers), and the Taras Shevchenko National Uni- versity of Kyiv (218 publications). Thus, it can be stated that in 2007--2016 Ukrainian and Russian researchers cooperated both at the level of aca- demic institutes and at the university level. The analysis of documents co-authored by Ukrainian and Russian researchers has enabled to determine the most productive areas of Ukrai- nian-Russian cooperation, in accordance with the Scopus classification. Twelve subject areas have been selected, in which over 100 documents were published for the period of 2007--2016 (Fig. 2). Ukrainian and Russian periodicals whose Eng- lish-language versions belong to SpringerNature publisher prevail among the scientific journals that have published the largest number of docu- ments based on the results of cooperation be- tween Ukrainian and Russian researchers. It should be noted that during the last decade, the number of citations of these editions increased significantly, even if self-citations are not taken into account (Fig. 3). The largest number of doc- uments was published in the following journals: Russian Journal of Inorganic Chemistry (88), Problems in Atomic Science and Technology (72), Bulletin of the Russian Academy of Scienc- ISSN 2409-9066. Sci. innov. 2017, 13 (5) Nazarovets, S.A.snoitatiC Fig. 3. Scientific journals that have published the largest number of documents upon the results of Ukrainian-Russian scientific cooperation in 2007--2016, based on Scopus data: Semiconductors; Russian Journal of Inorganic Che mist- ry; Low Temperature Physics; Bulle tin of the Rus sian Aca- demy of Science: Physics; Problems of Atomic Science and Technology es: Physics (60), Semiconductors (58), and Low Temperature Physics (57). The obtained results show that the joint pub- lishing activity of Ukrainian and Russian re- searchers with foreign co-authors engaged, has not significantly changed after the beginning of the hybrid war between Ukraine and Russia. Therefore, it can be concluded that Ukrainian and Russian scientists have not refused to par- ticipate in international scientific collaborations, even though they may engage researchers from the aggressor country. It is clear that in 2015 and in 2014, the re- searchers published results of joint research com- pleted before the beginning of armed conflict, therefore the data for these years may be unrepre- sentative. In this context, a slight decrease in the number of works co-authored by researchers from Ukrainian and Russian R&D institutions in 2016 could be interpreted as a negative impact of Rus- sian armed aggression against Ukraine in 2014-- 2016 on the future prospects of Ukrainian-Rus- sian scientific cooperation. If such a trend really takes place in the Ukrai- nian-Russian scientific communication, then the downward dynamics in the number of works co- authored by Ukrainian and Russian researchers will continue in subsequent years, and, accord- ingly, the study of this problem will require fur- ther monitoring. However, this decrease in the number of joint publications in 2016 is not so meaningful as compared with previous years, and can be explained, in particular, by the loss of Ukraine's scientific infrastructure that remained in the occupied territory. At the same time, the collected data on the joint publishing activity of Ukrainian and Rus- sian scientists do not allow us to conclude that this cooperation was remarkably effective and successful. In recent years, Ukrainian and Rus- sian researchers have been cooperating more closely with scientific partners from other coun- tries. The previous statements of Ukrainian and Russian government officials on the crucial im- portance of Ukrainian-Russian scientific coop- eration were declarative rather than factual. A significant part of the results of this cooperation has been published in the regional periodicals not included in the world abstract databases, and, accordingly, remains inaccessible to the world academic community. This fact has nega- tive consequences for the development of sci- ence in Ukraine. International cooperation of Ukrainian scien- tists requires a separate detailed study, including a thorough analysis of the factors that encourage Ukrainian researchers to work together with in- ternational partners, and an outlook of sources of funding for joint research in Ukraine's priority scientific disciplines. Similar results will be of great practical importance both for the scientists themselves and for the top officials of government institutions interested in developing internation- al academic cooperation and in improving the quality of domestic research.
