It addresses a specific mechanism of influence that can be evaluated in terms of its impact on sovereignty. This suggests a certain level of specificity, as it directly relates to the documented changes in Nigeria's health policies due to international partnerships.\n\n2. **governance_integration:** This aspect discusses the incorporation of international partners into Nigeria's public health governance. While it specifies the involvement of international entities, it is broader as it could cover a range of governance mechanisms, not all of which would necessarily result in an erosion of sovereignty. Hence, it may lack the precision needed to fully grasp the nuanced impacts on sovereignty.\n\n3. **global_health_security:** This aspect speaks to the overall state of protection against public health threats. While this is highly relevant to public health, it is a more general concept that does not directly address the nuances of Nigeria's sovereignty in the context of international partnerships. It does not focus specifically on governance or the implications of international influence on specific policies.\n\nWhen assessing the level of specificity among the three siblings:\n- 'policy_convergence' is specific and directly relevant to the sovereignty claim.\n- 'governance_integration' has some specificity but is less direct in its implications regarding sovereignty.\n- 'global_health_security' is the least specific and does not address the nuanced relationship with sovereignty particularly well.\n\nGiven these evaluations, we can conclude that while 'policy_convergence' is granular, the other two terms, particularly 'global_health_security', lack the same level of specificity. Thus, we can classify this group based on their specificity level:\n\nOutput: '<majority not granular>'"

It is specific because it highlights a particular factor (resource distribution) affecting coordination.\n\n2. **Organizational autonomy**: This aspect considers the independence of organizations and how it can result in different priorities and objectives, thus leading to conflicts.
