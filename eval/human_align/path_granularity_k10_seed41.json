Ideally, this should involve specific practices or methods relating to the direct handling of data rather than repeating the importance of legal frameworks.\n\nGiven the structure and description, it appears that the transition from data_privacy_laws to sensitive_biological_data_handling lacks the specificity expected for a new subaspect, as it reiterates the legal framework's importance instead of focusing on specific practices or issues within data handling itself.\n\n<bad granularity>"
